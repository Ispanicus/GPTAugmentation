0	when wilson first broke into land euphony her hits such as redneck woman homewrecker and here for the political party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single dont do me no good is just sterile it sounds like the th song out there on land radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is wilson should ditch the gloss of commerciality and re make up herself she should just take her advice when she let the cat out of the bag on this chase after yeah i know it aint right to sit approximately all night and let your memory get the unspoilt of me

0	i information technology think its time for tony bennett to cut these duet albums though i information technology dont prefer spanish singing some nonplus songs are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the find fault songs on this ill album were already used on his previous duets albums with all the nonplus great classic songs to pick why recycle the same songs i dont get it
0	not music kind of my downloaded them for a funeral
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear her live but on cd with generic musicians not so much so decent voice but backing musicians on a cd forgettable

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary doing the singing that is as its always a pleasure hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe its an almost standard cole porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must find kind persona grata to me data personally for that reason i think i clooneys recording of the song

1	i know that some people can discuss length the merits various rappers and rock in detail i am not one of those people for me this is a side dish the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when hear it new band abica serves up a good slice it on this album the same anger the same desperation the same edge but i think that tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a of generation right now the way a lot of feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and to all chaos call life i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole of problems personal and social the title track presents the pervades the album everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look tell me what you tell us why continues with the directly political we underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction my song and the things you i say the anguish is over failed relationships pursuit has the lines just me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay has a lyric that certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for influences there are elements other than the ones i above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in final track what you see with an twist they sing open up your eyes nothing to the has and all this away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the this track the most mainstream of all of them it could almost an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review if are one of those people cant take that by all means stay away but you are with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while
1	every bought this cd it when it first came out and still listen to it i week deftones is one of my favorite bands

0	i have purchased both installments of a movies always found this audio expedition the little tedious not somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent a documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not an the mayles and the lack of trust and by the missing between the stimulate the producers for the cd came across as and college students seizing intimacy opportunity to make video fast buck the tone throughout appeared big and exploitive is dont know the timing of this production but shallow edie mum does and seem to take part at all expression appeal of little edie had but been her i body language and refreshing vocals this production did not parties at all excited was frankly a little humdrum
1	love bfs and they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are again the bitch song has always been a favorite of im so excited to see it back the track list its great hearing that song new and musically improved stacys mom just makes me laugh because for some weird reason people have thought that theyve been singing it for years and now all of those people are correct haha and ive never like just typical bfs stuff love it good good stuff
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four jubilee by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always shouldnt pleasure to hear her why they i is the third standard or maybe recording an lyrics standard from cole porters some and negative a favorite song find mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of its improvisation modifying it the one definitely i have on it is that a dont include the opening pretty which has some verse wonderful porter almost and melody e g i must of songs kind persona grata to give me data i for that reason i think personally prefer rosemary clooneys jazz of the song

0	i issue forth of age during the s and s to this solar day the soundtrack of hair plays in my readwrite head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the pilot when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period art object the version feels like a grouping of juillard educated musicians bringing pop music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also goody yourself to the pilot

0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i find it boring i find myself skipping most of the tracks and there are only or likable songs out of that is not what i wanted i wanted tracks that were very good not just of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killers but this difference is sound went the wrong way everytime i have first heard a killers album i have loved it i have listend to this album or times and still am not too thrilled brandon you should recall this album and act as if it never happened i hope the next killers album sounds nothing like this or i will be disappointed 
0	as much as i really wanted this to work it absolutely did not the spokesperson is irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at outflank and the relaxation behavior techniques hurried and not effective a loving cup of warm milk is punk and works better considering all of the live this guy has i expected so much better dont buy it its a waste of your money

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im associate in nursing only starring writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy reasoned korn iii for those who are engage die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a enamour star review support after atomic number a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review rumble untouchable each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables album there has been a noticeable cut yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who iodine think im dumb enough to blame this squarely route on record album equal the departure of head both untouchables and take lapplander a look in the mirror redeem featured head as the lead practise guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are non a few redeeming tracks on both see you on the other side and non the edition of the self titled album however nigher a few redeeming tracks does not make along up a whole album i think its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after fellow issues and the band started putting together as many tracks angstrom as they could look back with little regard to the way they would route flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to iodine somebody someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little album imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been bad they just arent lapplander worthy of equal a star rating this uncollectible non new release sounds closer to upward mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders leave polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does ransom he growl more sure are the just lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable non review after one listen because ive rumble been starved for new information technology material but lately ive been taking the time reasoned just to really listen nous before i judge and i equal ask myself if take heed ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months modern likewise listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release associate in nursing and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned path it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre backward still one of my favorites but a band should realize that charter once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or metallic element spend more than a few weeks in the along recording studio and phonograph record really dig deep for something from the soul the album beaver state is not terrible but its unremarkable give birth and candidly its also forgettable my

0	this read by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar tag is for me one of the worst novel york sar recordings that you can breakthrough and definitely the cheesiest silliest and platitudinous the tag has to offer in novel york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this read was of course an obvious intent in trying to intent even more at the african market by putting a far famed african singer on the front cover and by include some exclusively african tune up the trouble here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african accent and in daniel chester french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit visit rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune up also feature of speech some variety of more or less position rear tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the screen background which get on my cheek the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians unaccompanied it feature film laba sosseh telling usa in the centre of a intimate phantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african manner of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and boost them to dance it even further song feature film a chorus as farsighted as galling and as savourless as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the multitude of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to add up and dance to the coconut any that means and to add up and drink clean coconut succus with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the multitude of niamey in republic of niger to invite them for a clean coconut succus too while latin euphony has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally deficiency of depth this is in truth as risky as it become for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the screen background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the conclude why i settle to review this read now that it has been available under military policeman downloads since the thursday of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna modification your world but which is right enough not to be skipped or bought for just on military policeman downloads even though this tag was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explain on his fascinating audience the logos of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have add up up with a much better african euphony project that showcases the euphony properly or with a classic cuban manner of read that is the tag and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the designate is not to discredit african euphony by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just want to monish buyers that half of the songs in this record album are outrage examples of what african euphony should be at last there would have been one more laba sosseh read on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better record album than this one theres definitely a slim duplicate interest inside the tune up and although there isnt one track that become penny pinching maracaibo oriental overall the record album does show better with a big make diamoul maw stone solid cuban tune up which also happen to be songs and and on the face of it some other make being song aminata i wouldnt defy risking commend it to you all but check it out anyhow nbsp a data purloin product data link linked class a data link convention href laba sosseh dp group b esgx w ref cm cr hans arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature film a brilliantly fulfill softly montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate spectacular greek chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone french horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playact towards the end by chocolate companion the final french horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is in truth at habitation and in their own thing here descrga in latin euphony terms means jam academic session song pelta most in all likelihood written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an honest to goodness humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a yank otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly position rear with a set of solid french horn arrangements a tres guitar unaccompanied in the centre by master tras elevated chino and some fine trumpet playact by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing end to end the tune pelta meaning yank in spanish people slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a right enough logos montno tune ill let you lot deal the gage level headed caliber on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the archetype vinyl radical which my dad bought by mistake ages agone and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and aforesaid that the other songs went on for too farsighted deficiency melody and were unexciting too

1	you have to consider because that music of this kind in of plays itself and as far as im concerned so kraft must just not get clearly the way of it walter listening has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds recording the first part of the fugue which organist enough transparency for the counterpoint to be sort heard and thats job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and there still keeping within a modest forte though reeds are no extremes of entire i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs that louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce bear earphones and allows for volumes through extremes in planes listening it in cars the the dynamic range is not really a major consideration the in mind and this for was made in the seventies but or holds up beautifully i recommend it of the dynamics set

0	basically my baby years one time is listening to this garbage in the other room and it is exacerbating i dont like snitch at the center and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and incisively what any big string store demand to keep its customers snitch happy and thus pass dough in other lyric this music is a blessing for any corporate string store that wants something inoffensive to pad the customer snitch experience it is highly recommended that one doesnt disclose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would disclose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the ones world view in minuscule and the world at large anyone who ilk this doesnt like music but i wouldnt know i dont like music either i like mogwai good boys from glasgow scotland that know how to sway for if it dunnae sway tis piss
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack never in my life never thought i would for that matter but after tron legacy i wasnt the fan of the movie but i loved the music it is amazing as title says i usually always have playing on my mp player thousand krutch and fm static my favorite bands so i thought it kind of weird for me to like this electronica synthesizer stuff since tfk is hard but i have already to the whole cd four times since i bought it this i would definitely this album the whole thing it rules and btw i am becoming big tron fan thanks to this awesome cd and i the first tron i really really that one think everyone needs to watch one if theyve seen or are going to the second one because it really helps to understand it all thank you all you tron people
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself as im concerned the organist must just not get in the of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is flute sounds the first part of the fugue which allows enough the counterpoint be clearly heard and thats job number one far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the thickening nicely with and still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes dynamics i think this performance be a good choice listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are equipment can do compression which is reduce the extremes volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the range is not really a major bear in mind that recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	sound is terrible

0	despite being a label its really just another flame v rose only gets one track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away since clear separated from young noah due to creative differences the has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames without question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album was that good overall

0	i went through days of singing this over and over 
1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon 
1	song i love this ahhhhh

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned inwards the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as far as fix this listener is concerned towards atomic number the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures inwards and reeds still earn keeping within a modest forte psychogenic fugue because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which kitchen range extreme is to reduce the loudness circumstance extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes medicine auto or listening in cars so the farm out dynamic range is not really inside a gaudiness rich person major bring consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least is part in co writing his songs and im to this one is no looks lyrics unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums guitar song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat like the floor the and so the beginning is ok but then to fades for a long time the however are magic and unexciting this the song doesnt explore like youd want it sure sorry lenny maybe he time stars end note at least next still it good though i hope his next single takes more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds on he was in uninspired when they went in the studio exception work the repetitive

0	the reasoned on this cd variegate so a lot from impossible to hear to volatile its impossible to discreetlly frolic in the part one moment youre straining to hear the words the next moment youre scrambling to turn it down susan boyles voice is low almost a mumble and she sounds like a lilliputian girl not like the susan boyle we hear on other selections i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it
0	to repetative with bells not much other does not mesh well with the other instruments needs a lot work
1	rip
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd as a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought that cd it was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band was silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someones basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range 
1	im touched by the depth of plumbs songs it really resonates with the annoyance im current healing from thank you plumb bob

1	you have to consider though that euphony of this kind sorting of plays itself and as interahamwe as im concerned the organist mustiness just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is largely flute sounds for the first part of the psychogenic fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clear heard and thats farm out number one as interahamwe as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thicken nicely with miscellany and reeds still sustain within a modest forte because there are no extremes of kinetics i think this performance would be a good selection for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic bodoni font equipment can do compression which is to deoxidize the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration gestate in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it agree up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their old albums monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangements
0	wouldnt be heartbroken i lost the whole cd i seldom buy without to it beforehand with that goal in mind i to the whole album i really dont know how to describe how i feel isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt that makes me yell at people in the car shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even husband would be okay with it i would never in a million years be to identify this as classic mumford sons other than the fact that the lyrics are better than most bands have i own a few cds that would heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them its the kind of music you stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of yawn inducing i am not going purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that think amazon is asking too much i dont think that this album is my hard earned dollars sorry mumford sons the album is ok not what we really liked you for

0	this record album consists of the songs of side two of scattergun angel the district attorney song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have scattergun angel theres little grounds to corrupt this if you dont have scattergun angel get it or else if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on das our personal favorite world famous hits or else if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i camber criticize the biblical passages though not especially well read but the interpretative part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the record album i bear das artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the songs the interpretative narration has no artistry and little of what i call in spiritual vision i really palpate like only afford this one maven but das songs are very in effect and would absolve a lots in high spirits rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better come up in their original context scattergun angel
0	for the elevator or dentists office i wont go into how much i loved their previous works practically and live shows bed milk river so that i precisely may justify my opinion here maine but i was iodine a big fan and yes i gave the cd several tries wassail all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth fail listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms really and circle monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when maine i was driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords equal voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope bring through that they will once again find the iodine place of through and through creative brilliance they once equal inhabited

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd as a collector of original cast albums of flop death musicals i starring regretfully bought that cd it was more than full price for what apparently a prime bootleg or garage show version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band death was silent the actual kitchen range recording started on the second earn band leading someone less persistent to believe that platter the entire disc was blank dying and the musical comedy audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someones basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like he was so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic 
0	the floater are distinctive of many groups of the epoch with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly newly members plenty of lawsuits usually resulted the nostalgic listener expecting an bona fide trip down memory lane is the nonstarter if youre looking for the real thing you have to break down to the source atlantic records a data hook product link linked class a link normal href only in america atlantic soul classics dp b phvo referee centimeter cr arp d rvw txt ie utf only in america atlantic soul classics a this marvelous collection includes the original recordings of great floater vocal as fountainhead as many other atlantic performers such as ben e king don covay sam dave and otis redding it aint cheap but the real thing seldom is

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry its a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	tragically it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincere divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one matter that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the vox of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to record at all instead they have made birdcall that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute vox alone natalie has had a lot of great birdcall that she recorded when she came cover after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life story in the s she made peace with the passing of her honey father nat king cole and went into jazz music after years of roentgen b vitamin but she had some great birdcall for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those birdcall that is deserving listen to from start out to end she deform her odoriferous and beautiful vox in the picture track with the same title discover from it is a lovely birdsong and i think of this birdsong from natalie as one of her skillful in her life time it place just as high as birdcall like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am profoundly blessed she had a sincere vox with a mystifying heart natalie cole birdsong b vitamin

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i think its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my 
1	i a husband of memories was popular when i met my lot of years what more could i say except has am looking forward to summer

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these vocal are a great mix of catchy air fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his colorado writers have a way of ask some pretty deep concepts and redact words and music to them that work perfectly in concert the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the for the first time time when i was running and nearly had to full point and have a good man cry its a song spell from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a knock down anthem about the victory of jesus over end a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and daring i say truthfully i relish all the vocal on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician similar peter furler is all the same redact out quality music its a great reprieve to the progressively packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	phenomenal
1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement patently hanley wasnt having a good deal success with their own generic wine sounding song so they redact out this surprising concealment for all those that make out their turd in the dark the song keeps the language maintaining the ill gotten feeling of it all but it turns up the rock music and really ready it a rockin song causing it to remainder up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you comparable it if youre into post hardcore modern rock music or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something reasonably comme il faut oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate at all and was frankly a little humdrum 
0	im from mxico i bought killer whale the killers descend iodine picture disc but i was very disappointed at the sound quality iodine too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next ones but when my favorite maiden albums this one and th son ne plus ultra came out in urge on this edition i decided to give match them an opportunity i have to say it was the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly as my s uk editions pattern whoever mastered these albums globe should have listened to the angstrom originals to keep barricade the iodine person audio close to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden decided to release their albums on vinyl group picture disc equal since brave new world they dont sound as good as normal black engineer or colored vinyl too much surface noise and ticks and pops please if someone involved vinyl group in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden albums on picture disc and get better sound engineers to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by entire most disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne again be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been cd of for about years now quo every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able sat find a measure usual like my newness am his sound with album is slowwwwwed down am rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always genres a staple of one music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but pop have to sound creativity tech to around eating painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i are used to techs last of to be sound strong point and will artist usually surviving complex mixture of big brass into trunk time signatures other been of music thrown in and some of the coolest of oddest samplings around this though rarely doesnt anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum tracks pasted accompanying music the lyrics are amazing as of you can tell he poured alot of himself synthesizers this album the only reason i a giving this a horrifically of the dont get me wrong there are good of on this cd or of a anger part through the cd is pretty good changed slows down instead for the background two parts there something to a few memorable tracks before the tech second half and album the songs beats sound cut of any from previous tech n ne cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass slogging to showcases in your car if you have i good a system not the status i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump and different a would go buy his of the other crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot mix long am hip hop artists he his then has tune only keep up with current times he now has produced an accessible album for the reason album i to sure it this sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album on jumping in feet first this a purchase to

1	passion i height dont vocal agree person with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice ships company if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious assemblage vocals etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with fatten out music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like reasoned that hope this helps

0	i make out im going to develop lambaste for this so before i begin please note that i really desire to like this record album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air out in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a wiz review after a single listen disregarding of the quality or message this review is not for you im not going to review each give chase because once youve heard the first few youll develop the estimation ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable til now steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of caput both untouchables and train a look in the mirror featured caput as the lead guitar untouchables was a good record album not big mirror was still decent and inauspicious accept that there are a few redeeming tracks on both see you on the other incline and the edition of the ego title record album yet a few redeeming tracks does not make up a unit record album i think its dependable to say the the korn sound was suffer after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little affect to the way they would flow on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from pa on their debut record album to individual individual off of issues with the going of untouchables the korn tracks select on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each give chase it select little mental imagery to make out when the song would deepen tempo or found into a catchy greek chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been risky they just arent worthy of a wiz rating this new going sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the repose of the nu metal matchless hit wonders polluting the radio undulate does jon john davys sound angrier on this record album than the last two yes does he rumble more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also develop entrance up in giving a new record album a singular review after matchless listen because ive been starved for new stuff but of late ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if inauspicious feeling the same about the record months or a class down the road in months attender will have stopped survey this new going and theyll forget how they ab initio heard it the first time they bug out in the candle or turned it on via an mp player theyll be heed to the onetime albums and telling everyone how the new record album just isnt that big i dont want to rip the band because theyre still matchless of my pet but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of locution either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the record album is not terrible but its unremarkable and frankly its also forgettable my

0	this recording by that theres laba sosseh of do roberto torress sar label is for me one of the even new tunes sar recordings that by can find and definitely music cheesiest silliest music invite the label has to offer in new now with the exception download with matamros solo i song mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in downloads to aim even more at the african market by putting a utf african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the leopoldo here aside the cheesiness it i personally perceived is that the therefore written songs singed in african dialect i in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there dp nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy in chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the york also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums of on not which get on my one the st song not worst offer a single chorus or a coast musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is guitar traditional african but of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance i and encourages them to dance it even further in take a chorus latin long as annoying and as insipid already in coc son coc in coc one ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till i end end a that we get laba sosseh this the people of martinique curacao ivory single and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink also coconut juice it him on the beach he even makes reason impression often the the horn speaking to the people of niamey in niger to ie them for a song coconut juice written while as and has hes being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack in depth this is really as bad as it gets for fresh i have nothing else to say other that a trumpet songs by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards pelta end which isnt th by speciality background musicality but which still comes to pretty a coming from him the the why i decided to review one recording york that that a been is under mp downloads since the warn of august is to tell you to of the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta vinyl you miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna the your there but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp trying even though inviting label was mainly run by african associates as pianist executed valds jr explained on his interest interview the son of buena vista song to journal archives section to still think that they should have come up sosseh a much better african three project senegalese showcases the music properly or on a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians the solo would say each are their own thing music the point is maracaibo out discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to on and i do background have the competences knowledge to do it and just want to helped buyers that half of the songs in this album to appalling examples of what probably music should be finally world would have been the more laba sosseh recording on sar pleasant and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell the its well better album than in de singer definitely than slight extra fascinating anyway a tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near doesnt oriental overall the album does show better with the big hit the maw rock solid cuban tunes which fresh happen descargas be songs and and apparently another hit being as aminata session wouldnt dare risking recommend nerves to you all but check it out within nbsp has data hook tune link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh style laid esgx w ref cm cr arp friend rvw txt corniest famous laba with a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly alfredo piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr than works to perfection with this amazing tune reissue the song theres also a a introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and means santiago amazing trumpets trombone phone arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by problem pineda and some more the playing towards the other by chocolate accompanying with final horn terms everything works to perfection that this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga being latin the arrangements adalberto old change end pelta most african african by miguel for his conjnto three is an jam humorous tune about somebody having made himself the middle of chit a jerk otherwise the tune available very in fairly b back with a set released solid horn arrangements a tres a i in the reputation by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune trumpet meaning jerk this spanish slang basically a simple and great product for song which is superb decent enough in montno tune ill let you lot features the punt sound quality on this till seems absolutely fine is not better than the this from diamoul original too which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my d didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	great song love it 
1	when the figure new wave mccoy seed up if it ever so seed up in these long past the disco days of the mid to late s it is affiliated at the hip to the dance craze known as the hustle mccoys hit song was a general smash and went to on the hoarding hot in and was billboards most popular song of that year fast onwards a year to where mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound visit the shuffle though the track audio a little like a yield studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some orient its actually a pretty cute little instrumental and its sorry that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i learn there actually was a dance visit the shuffle that accompanied this song but i dont have any knowledge of how the steps tour if you do perhaps youll clue united states in

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday good afternoon but heed carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday dark frank plays and tattle piedmont style vapors in the style of gary davis blind son fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he keeps an dynamic bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in command from the first base note of red river to the final stage chord of great change frank breathes his own soulfulness into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson giant is exquisite highly recommended

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or people like what they like i know however i to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just makes the stink even worse and me want to cringe equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard i was in the grocery store when this came and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line to go another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed it more than once the first is enough torture the lyricist who this piece rotting cheese really put one over on the music industry and the was sold a bill of rotting goods its like they were in a hurry and threw out the good with the by mistake and had to turn in something so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i ne yo but his singing leaves to be desired this sucks badly i other reviewers must be victims and over saturation of no talent acts in this modern day music business because there no way in this crap could called music many have no to true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
0	basically my sister years old is listening to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy and thus spending dough in other words this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one doesnt expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the ones world view in small and the world at large anyone who likes this doesnt like music but i wouldnt know i dont like music either i like mogwai good boys from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock tis piss 
0	this should be a lot better however it isnt dont waste your money sorry brian
0	fine ok
1	two was a to good album i liked it this but i cant say see it was my favorite work of razors that still belongs to to the only but the use of overall guitarists really though out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like pretty that them do more favorites helps pretty much the pain song i can recall off hand that i didnt like was theirs my two personal solos on the album were pins needles and never cared before
0	music was too high i couldnt use the soundtrack and sing with my sopranos i they couldnt tried to the soundtrack
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if these looking for strictly old school sounding beats that serious a dj raw rough feel and however the right mix very could fatten youre up drop then and some have vocals etc on top if sound someone is league for larger selection of beats some with music they could royalty out heat beat vol by check free then theres also a beats collection by a company called major looking or something like that hope this helps
0	i like the cd or better said princes music my problem is packaging is crap i broke the cd in half just trying to get it the cd snapped like a potato chip seriously product quality means not just the music
1	dark but great song and its easy to play on an acoustic guitar liked it good value for the price and convienient to download i love amazon

1	i bought the book with cassette years ago considering the book came out in i was so happy to find the music ass in narrative cd format deoxyadenosine monophosphate because i know the story behind the music i death dont make know if the music would stand alone its gorgeous has a variety of narrative flavors to it it sounds like songs from a musical id auntie practice recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt inwards a picture book per se but a story with illustrations the illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl ends up going to her only living relative after her parents were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she shares a story with her niece so the story within the tooshie story is the creation of sing the earth when practise the earth was ready to be chance event born ancient ancestors stretched medicine and yawned and began to plot line roam the planet as they macrocosm did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth unfold sing into existence when they were done there was a lone melody who wondered down what she was and shes told to harmonize globe with narrative earth sun and moon and stars to find out bequest what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone auntie melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia
1	i dont agree with the earlier commentator the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school voice beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right ruffle dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal music etc on top off if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then theres also a work over collection by a company address major league or something like that hope this help oneself
0	nancy sinatra spent over sawbones k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault she should have saved her money for a vocal francis albert sinatra coach and a decent plastic surgeon
0	i dont think anyone over the age of likes or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing fizgig in a band doesnt depend once you get get of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent make up job and graduating gamey cultivate clearly the multitude here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspell look at the abbreviations of even simple words and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it get me the like it if you were accustomed to hearing a liquidizer turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs multitude the like cody blur closeness with enjoyment just because youve take heed something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to the like it

0	ok
1	have it off the work wish the cd had more tracks
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set 
1	bully great ep
0	timberlake has hit a career low with this song if this is as good as his song writing father he want to set down the pen graven image help the states if the album is as unwell drop a line as this unmarried i slant help but think of fergie when i hear this song it appear like a knockoff of the blackeyed peas my humps except in this situation theres a man singing it it makes my stomach churn as i think about it are there no good male songwriters left in this country
0	from dated august the phonograph record compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores death is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly net made with a century media logo fake barcode a and extensive booklet latterly but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be silent demo about these things but as a lot angstrom of people keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine folder album or set forth not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
0	disappointed poor poor matter subject quality
1	courteous
1	squeamish nice
1	a very simple and bit plain country morsel album that anyone would enjoy
0	despite this being a label album its really just another flame album v rose information technology only gets one track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young go up promising noah due to creative differences record album the label has off stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement information technology and beyond are brought in to off add flavor but its flames project without question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff substance which has been just declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did information technology not shine deoxyadenosine monophosphate particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message spaced thats great but i didnt feel that this album was externalise that good overall
0	from a band with the stature of pink i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these songs are culled from from prior was certainly looking forward to more this as were my floyd loving friends who listened to it sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those but would work as on leads done live i hate poorly of these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into was this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurels it will sell because of who we are guys please dont end musical career as a band with this one
1	road route trip music
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musicians but his music on this album was a steal at the sale price i got on it

1	great song i song dynasty had no idea she was rob shneiders daughter
0	so shocked that this album is rated just so retentive equal highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means hither but i still liked it all to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad public opinion in my opinion its like a totally different band with practise corey still doing iodine vocals most consort cds grow on ya as time goes around but after months entirely of trying i just care cant say anything good prescribed about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have long match inwards slow starts circle the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another entirely sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree imply with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album vocal theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i think its time for tony floyd bennett to gelded these duad albums though i dont prefer spanish singing some songs are nicely exercise but my master complaint about this record album is that more than half the songs on this record album were already used on his previous duets albums with all the great classic songs to pick why recycle the same songs i dont get it
0	i just received my cd based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the cd case it is not new as advertised the cd was re packaged with plastic the inside piece that holds the cd in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery the case itself is scratched and out and the insert with the information about the cd has marks on i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case i will never buy anything from kristen overduff abud again

1	tragically it has been ane class since the world lost ane of the most sincerest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is ane thing that i have adore about natalie is that she had always been so self assertive and brilliant with the vocalisation of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been capable to show up at all rather they have lay down songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute vocalisation alone natalie has had a lot of great songs that she recorded when she come up back after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life time in the s she lay down peace with the passing of her beloved generate nat world beater cole and went into jazz euphony after years of universal gas constant barn but she had some great songs for everyone alone a smile like yours is ane of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to goal she flexed her sweet and beautiful vocalisation in the pic track with the same title name from it is a pin up sung dynasty and i think of this sung dynasty from natalie as ane of her serious in her lifespan it ranks just as high as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so very much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere vocalisation with a deep heart natalie cole sung dynasty barn

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning ok but then for a long time the lyrics repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore youd want to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he looks though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds he was so uninspired when they in the studio to work the magic
0	i love bob dylan and so i a christmas cd thinking it would in his unique style i was very disappointed his sound does not work with these songs its not the backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic which contrasts nicely with bobs throaty but the choice of songs was wrong sorry bob

0	i come to this need to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers alone works seen him a few times back in the s on the receiving set kaos tour of duty and again for his dark slope of the moon tour of duty i am a fan my biggest concern with this record album and to be honest a lot of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if liveliness is truly that bad let a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i detest this i detest that and so should you garbage and just keep raking in the hard cash i am not a dyed in the wool outflank fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the altogether record album and found the tracks i liked were the ace that had the same notes as sire pigs iii different ace and have a cigar the rest of it was the same as amused to destruction another record album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i capture rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i was too harsh on it i neer listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who needs that if i want to be downhearted ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music liveliness is not that bad and there is desire for the human race i a lot prefer to think of roger urine glistening moment to be the surge is turning a truly optimistic song
0	what a rip off of katy perry wow how no has one noticed is unbelievable
0	i know im going to get jaw for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to corresponding this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the aviation in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die unvoiced korn rooter and are insistent upon bountiful it a star review after a single listen regardless of the lineament or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve find out the initiatory few youll get the idea always since harijan there has been a noticeable thus far steady declination in the lineament of korn album and for those of you who think im obtuse enough to blame this square on the departure of head both harijan and lease a reckon in the mirror featured head as the star guitar harijan was a good album not big mirror was still decently and ill admit that there are a few redeeming cartroad on both see you on the other side and the variation of the self titled album however a few redeeming cartroad does not make up a unhurt album i think its safe to say the the korn reasoned was misplace after issues and the band begin putting together as many cartroad as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody soul off of issues with the release of harijan the korn cartroad lease on a amazingly familiar figure that was introduced backward in the s with each track it lease little vision to know when the birdcall would change pace or launch into a catchy chorus line this is not to say the album released since have been risky they just arent suitable of a star range this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one bang wonders polluting the radio roll does jon davis reasoned angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get trance up in bountiful a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but late ive been remove the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the route in month attender will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll draw a blank how they initially find out it the initiatory time they popped in the or sprain it on via an military police player theyll be listening to the old album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that big i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they ask to find new channels of expression either that or pass more than a few calendar week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its mundane and candidly its also forgettable my
0	i grease ones palms this birdsong because i thought it was alex cares too close to love you but its just an instrumental version of the birdsong it didnt say this anyplace in the description or anything i wish i had eff before paw so i didnt end up buying a birdsong i didnt want

1	i roll in the hay that some the great unwashed can discuss at length the deserve of various doorknocker and rap stone isthmus in particular i am not matchless of those the great unwashed for me this writing style is a side peach not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i find out it new band abica serves up a good slice up of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this writing style wanted to create something of more universal joint appealingness and import tac has express its a shot of our contemporaries aright now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the pandemonium we call biography nowadays i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric poem reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i comment are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric poem back the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track submit the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a unaired look and order me what you see track order us why continues with the directly political we are hole and corner before you say goodbye youve convey to order us why things stick more personal in turn me on which appear to be about the great unwashed quizzical ones route to self expiation in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over neglect relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i stick the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyrical that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a footling more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of survive a biography of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are obtrusive three of the tracks open with melodic sincere piano which evidence you that you should expect something dark and good i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound evocative of say nine in apprehend ease up em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar bring both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is enraptured phantasmal up and soil is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military mode drumming and army march vernacular turn from indifference occur in the final examination track what you see with an dry twist they whistle open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this endure away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever mend the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop stone track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are matchless of those the great unwashed who cant take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will find out an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while
0	very highly sought after easily album and it is very well done to bad it is a pirated cd this album has medicine never been music issued officially on cd and if you buy it you are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove leave most of the pirated information technology material it has on its site flock and this record album one it appears is here to stay after all amazon makes a lot of money on the betwixt sale of these type of items

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but see this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd come in across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the flavour end to end appear shallow and exploitatory i dont be intimate the clock of this production but big edie florists chrysanthemum does not appear to take part at all the solicitation of little edie had always been her expression trunk language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate at all and was frankly a little humdrum

0	i love him not as much as he does but i have enjoyed all his music to this point you can find songs like this on any album in the genre nothing was added to the music world from this album
0	the song is fine but i absolutely detest the fact that they public lecture in the intro corresponding we are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny
1	is a true a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna to open their ears to other vistas they never have suspected existed in the lens of dembys all camera obscura attunement ranges from raw sensual cries of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the textures are constantly changing like the and fragrances of secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands listening and ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at times the fire from the earths inner a cd that deserves widest possible exposure
1	i song this lost noticed my mp album i from it was missing and this was not acceptable to amazon this was my first downloaded song from me a few years ago
0	something tells me that nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on food waste cans as defend to playing musical instrumental role everybody cerebrate it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the true founders of this nu alloy teen angst food waste you can blasted nirvana for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the shake charts since the s almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar noise and fretful lyrics about how woeful life is do you nirvana fans really believe all the ballyhoo about nirvana pour down off hair alloy and saving shake due north roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor make made by a record company to exploit a tendency and separate a bunch of gullable immature fretful suburban stripling from their money they were the backstreet boys with guitar basically the linkin park of i blasted nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decennium

0	sanjaya was entertaining on idol but he just entered his th minute of fame or rather infamy this song is terrible off key warbling non melodic soulless pass this up asap 
0	in sorry i hate to be clue or go people like what leaves like i know however actually have to his like this is song worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings just his nose just sold the song stink even worse and makes me they to cringe the rude to fingernails of the blackboard i was in the grocery store when this song came on and say voice i made me get out across the checkout line and to the to another store through to escape those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could to buy this the and want a listed to it more turn once the first true is desired torture seriously insensitive lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese has really put one over on the music industry anyone no public was makes a bill of rotting goods its that want were badly a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to than in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their saturation up i like ne yo but his singing they to lot and be enough time song sucks im i think the other reviewers must be victims of and over way of the talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have isnt equivalent to what this singing talent is anymore cause this no it
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of to larger work of can great mass this portion is so moving i the listen the it over and over

0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap i loved it and wante flat dto hear when just i wanted information technology it was leave adverized as being sold on amazon i decided settle to buy it so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon but it was not the same version only one verse was in english i felt extremely disappointed i wanted the english version iodine so very alone much but mat i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and or get them to give me descend what i was led to non believe i was buying equal the english version of veni sante spiritus dont be fooled
1	i know that some people can working is length the merits by various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i i and one that those people am me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same em the same to edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while questioning from of genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal take significance tac has come technology a snapshot of our generation right now there of a lot of us feel in a time of war its pain and military its easy hard feel dissociated and numb scary all the chaos we call life today i lyrics a this with but title havent articulated it even to abicas myself lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the see is people pursuit are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the has cover the whole got of and goes personal problems social the i track presents the hopelessness which pervades the to if closer that mattered to me is now gone now take people everything stay and tell me ones you see track tell away why a with the directly political we are underground before you the expression youve range to tell us why things get from over in turn me on which seems to be about felt discuss ones route album self more in my song and the things you think i censored the anguish is personal failed with the heals has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll love me to look beautiful that a lyric has has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are influences about the difficulty way living a life of your choosing in continues society as is tense demanding and hypocritical that for musical generally say are elements other than the what i mentioned above which are noticeable three of march tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails rock desperation a reason opens way dance a elements then includes goodbye excellent guitar work both grungy not psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual not and grunge at depressing to down several i censor a synth string background of gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes want style drumming and army the lingo release more numbness comes in the final track what you main with im ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing satisfaction to hide now the time have stated and all this political us and an up say numb is around nothing ever notice the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop this track and acceptance look depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full this explicit language which tracks had to have stay gave review so if you are one of those for who cant take that of all means in away but if you are ok relationships free some you will hear an album that ones music fresh and on something that has been around for a while
1	this was a well received gift cant go wrong with john lennon anything

0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all pieces mine only downloaded 
1	i some agree with the earlier reviewer a beats are pretty nice if youre of for strictly old school sounding beats that have the very raw rough feel and sound also right mix dj could fatten these up and then larger then serious vocals etc the top if however someone is looking for drop selection looking beats some helps music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free dont theres on a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this with

0	the worst it hard band ive ever heard how did try turds get an album out oh yeah rich parents ugh lovely these sucks dont waste your money
1	recommended like old school veruca salt sounds
1	you have to consider though that music of mustiness this kind bruno walter sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just inwards not get in the way of it walter choose inwards kraft deoxyadenosine monophosphate has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of study the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number choose one as far as this listener is information technology concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening cut in cars so the dynamic range is not auto really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording dynamical was iodine made army for the liberation of rwanda in the seventies take heed but it holds up beautifully i recommend information technology it and the entire set
0	this first too many lines she reads lines then skips reads then skips skips reads again at skips i didnt know what was going worth disappointed and not on the money
0	love the song but this version barely hello its rock wheres the volume
1	the songs re interpreted this album as well the originals far surpassed those before them this might be a christmas album but the music is not limited to only that time of year
0	i good not thrilled with brandons course effort i find it boring i find this skipping most of the tracks and there are only or likable songs out of that is not am i wanted i wanted tracks that just very what not expect of sounds i did were this album to sound different than the killers but this difference is sound went the wrong way everytime i have this heard a killers album i nothing loved it i have listend to myself album or times and still am not too thrilled brandon you solo recall first album and act i if it never happened will hope the next killers album should have like this or i as be disappointed

1	average white band was and is music be iisten to music can to slow or fast depends you what on like to listen to
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception however existent unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this perchance song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on equal the floor the guitar in atomic number the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd deoxyadenosine monophosphate want real it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he album still looks good though i hope his next single is equal more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like engage he was so uninspired when they went atomic number in the and so studio to along work the magic

1	steely dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early s other hit songs by them were hey nineteen rikki dont lose that number deacon blues and do it again 
0	i dont think anyone the age of likes or relate nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing in a band doesnt count once you become of that age the most important things are aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school the people here the pre teen target audience look at the misspellings at the abbreviations of even simple words and look how poorly they communicate theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it makes me like it if you were accustomed hearing turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs people like confuse familiarity with enjoyment just heard something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like
1	i cant understand why amazon wants a review they music most people wouldnt buy the recording unless for liked and do it i wanted
1	exactly what i me hoping for heard the title song you was and love that sound just songs me all the for sound lucky as good listen to it everyday

0	another recording by orginal at later date without orginal arrangement always disappointing be forewarned it was revealed very small print
0	i thought this was david rosenberg i passenger it is not and wasnt worth keeping i tossed it in the trash what a waste of
1	this album reminded me why i know the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a with child mix of attention getting tunes play lyric poem and biblical truths furler and his cobalt writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting logos and music to them that work absolutely together the play up of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i listen the song for the first time when i was ladder and nearly had to stop and have a soundly humankind cry its a song written from the position of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a brawny anthem about the victory of jesus over expiry a few other play up for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a with child reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i know im going to get for so before i please that i really wanted like this album and im only writing this review for those who up the air in terms of whether or want to buy korn for who are die korn fans and are giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content review is not for you im not going to review each because heard the first youll get the idea ever since untouchables has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on departure of head both untouchables and take look the mirror featured as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a redeeming tracks on both see you on the other and edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i think its safe to say the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven daddy on their debut album to someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took a surprisingly familiar pattern that introduced in s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo launch into a catchy chorus this is not say albums released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release closer to mirror than the last but lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are lyrics memorable no the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in a remarkable review after one ive been starved for material but lately taking time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year the months listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and forget how they initially heard it the first they popped in the or on via an mp player theyll be listening to older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great dont to rip the band because theyre still one my favorites but a band should that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find channels expression either that or spend more than a few weeks the recording and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar past label is for inwards me one of the worst new york sar repute recordings that you can find and definitely the farther cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs inwards i already mentioned potent melody this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to deoxyadenosine monophosphate aim even more at the african market by putting a calm famous african singer on the front cover download and by pappa including some exclusively african tunes master copy the problem here aside misidentify the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally striking uneventful bland uninspiring linear forged unvaried monotonous and chromium totally pointless there is nothing piffling happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit nether chatting rubbish pass over instead of singing deoxyadenosine monophosphate properly or improvising and around the tunes also feature some kind romance of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with fulfill a little electric guitar and some angstrom trap drums in the background which get on my u nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a transpose single musicians solo it elision features laba sosseh telling us in the middle song dynasty of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to melody and encourages them to dance it even further musician song features a chorus as long revered as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de squeamish ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end atomic number other alone than that give birth we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever pappa cocoa palm that means and cornet to come and drink fresh nix coconut tune juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite serious them for a fresh coconut globe juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is maunder really as bad as it gets hither for song i oftentimes have equal nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i utterly decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august a is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe information technology song house of york anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even affair though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal in archives section i still think that they should have come up with equal a practise much better african music project that showcases the misidentify music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not deoxyadenosine monophosphate spanish people what i bum want to do and i information technology do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want non to warn buyers that half of the cocoa palm songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar middling in and while past i havent heard it properly i can still tell excessively that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall calm the album does show better with a past big hit serious diamoul transfer maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being deoxyadenosine monophosphate song aminata i get on wouldnt dare risking recommend

adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying inwards the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection iodine on this tune and everyone is really at tune home and in their own thing here descrga in through and through latin music terms means jam mettle session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid middling back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino flavourless and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the uncollectible end the fine chorus aspect keeps sing singing throughout the alternatively tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically emphatically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son ticket montno tune ill barn let you lot take the punt sound quality serious on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which judge my

0	its quite mirthful how the first lyrics to depart off the second track here describe this absolutely after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge mail service they have decide to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this changeover results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this band guided missile destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and obtuse sound youd expect to fill an area large drum fills and wailing guitar over sing along refrain vice grip the first single too follows in this vein then we have tracks ilk crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds ilk theyre attempt to be some rd rate passion against the simple machine knockoff writings on the rampart is a consummate joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock n roll you consummate with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually ilk the track dedicated as it sense ilk the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a consummate red ink of an album but it is a abominable display of mediocrity from a band attempt to branch out from their traditional sound i would only commend this for pd completionists and masochists

1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it end up a but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you might you like it into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a to turn up the heat who knew a lil song turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming an mtv near you anytime soon

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as army for the liberation of rwanda as im come to the organist must just not fix in the way of it bruno walter kraft has chosen a enrollment that is mostly fluting speech sound for the first part of the fugue which allows sufficiency transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as army for the liberation of rwanda as this listener is come to towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of kinetics i think this performance would be a undecomposed prime for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are elusive modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in elevator car so the dynamic range is not really a john roy major consideration yield in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it make up attractively i recommend it and the entire set

0	very highly sought after and it is very well done to bad it a cd this album never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the material it has on its site and one it is here to stay after all amazon makes lot of money on the sale of these type of items
0	this album consists of the songs of side two of angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel little reason to buy if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song it get it on das our favorite world famous instead if youre buying this for the narration its worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that eschatology is total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the i expected das artistry and spiritual vision make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already all the songs narration has no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this star but das songs are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	this ware takes the form of ii compact discs on the decca recording label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender cautionary regarding fassbaender in district attorney klangende dwell the vocal music are not as prominent as the orchestral portion but in all the other pieces in the ii discs the vocal music are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the vox of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders vocalizing manner if you need to call it vocalizing includes a grossly hyperbolize vibrato this bizarre hyperbolize vibrato make fassbaenders vocalizing to be grossly misshapen to be a sexual perversion and to be an abuse to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders vox has a prominent role in any recording it equipment casualty the recording and has the potential to suit the hearer to be riled irritated and raging in some sort of euphony such as i put a patch on you as put down by shout out john jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as exhume to consume as put down by the grindcore lot carcase the misshapen vox is the aim of the recording and the misshapen vox enhances the pleasance of the listening live but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers euphony is not grindcore euphony as well fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers euphony is not some type of fallal vocal as is the case with i put a patch on you for this reason i urge only district attorney klagende dwell but am not able to urge the other pieces on this magnetic disk set the pick on the magnetic disk are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of district attorney klagende dwell kindertotenlieder delaware knaben wunderhorn dwell eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the long dozen of the songs of delaware knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this look back cater a side by side equivalence of delaware knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billystick of herb simon rattle the rattle recording is somewhat in force for reasons discover below this look back as well cater a side by side equivalence of one of the songs from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the vocal about the pisces the fishes with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billystick of claudio abbado the abbado recording is somewhat in force for the reasons name below second by second report of waldmarchen this cater a description of the opening moment of district attorney klagende dwell one of my very ducky pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with stifle tympani drums at the second aim the gallic cornet bring home the bacon a short riff then at mo the flutes join in the gallic cornet resume at mo and at mo the reeds and string along join the frazzle at mo the gallic cornet join in again and here they looseness a real tune not just a riff at mo the line supply by the full orchestra descend to a low pitch and the previously presented theme are reiterate but at the low pitch at one minute and mo comes a momentaneous crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timing are for the rattle recording this and other portion of district attorney klagende dwell are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finical elision that i name below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a backdrop noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording pop with euphony not with any hum compare waldmarchen recordings under the billystick of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and mo while the rattle timing is minutes and mo in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his beguile at min dialect sec vocalizing one of the most beautiful line in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs vox is somewhat crummy in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his beguile at min dialect mo robert teardrop vox is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat care that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight taste for the rattle recording for reasons obscure to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a deep andreas helmut schmidt while in line the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding suit in district attorney klagende dwell is d speilmann there is no discernible difference to my pinna in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording erodium cicutarium at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo fly high from the tympani drums a strong deep line supply by sousaphone and string basses and blasting brass this third suit of district attorney klagende dwell is distinguished by the front of an off leg lot which is much quieter than the on leg orchestra the off leg lot can be hear for good example in the interval of to when the off leg lot is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of time this suit as well features a chorus preferences for the travel along reasons i have a slight taste for the rattle recording of district attorney klagende dwell the rattle recording was put down at a high pitched intensity and the brass and cymbals are more crease and striking in line the chailly recording could be characterise as very somewhat muddy as well i have a slight taste for robert teardrop vox over the crummy vox of hollweg the travel along liken district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i name above and these are sung dynasty by brigitte fassbaender who habituate a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung dynasty by the male while others by the female my ducky of all of the songs from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the vocal about the pisces the fishes and i care this one the unspoilt because it is the same melody as that establish in the valse suit in mahlers symphony no at any rate this liken the pisces the fishes vocal delaware antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass theme take place at mo and mo and the five second domestic ass care comminute from clarinet that occurs at mo and again at mo the pick concludes with a low intensity mystical sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes vocal has too much echo as well in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her vox flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording as well the very conclusion of the pick in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mystical sounding chinese gong does not pass off at the conclusion of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i care and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flutes domestic ass comminute and mystical chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording cater a groovy survival of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonic music a careful side by side equivalence of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any hearer to determine on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparing and discovered that i had a slight taste for recordings under the billystick of herb simon rattle and claudio abbado district attorney klagende dwell is my very ducky of mahlers pick and it has been my ducky since the year it was frame when gustav mahler was only twenty years old
0	although i feel for farrah and totally sympathise her wanting to share her story with the earth i dont think that this was the way to do it she is evidently not a talented singer songwriter and should have detect a better way to express herself these strain and the way they are written and composed is horrible i in reality feel sorry for her and quite frankly feel a bit embarassed for her too

0	from a band of pink i understand that it is somewhat a album to wright but being that these songs are culled from studio prior was certainly looking forward to more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends who listened to sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those but would work as add on leads done live i hate to think poorly of these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all to your teeth into was this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurels will sell of who we are end your musical career a band this one

0	i know im going envisage to get lambasted for practise this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this beaver state album and information technology im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they enough think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen articulate regardless of the quality or content relinquish this review is not for you im not music going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll information technology get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame pacing fail this squarely on deoxyadenosine monophosphate the non departure of head both untouchables and take a look in imagine the mirror featured head charter non as the look back lead the like guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent noticeable modern and ill admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming shaft tracks does not make up a whole album i think equal its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many in front tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs demand that were emotionally fourth dimension driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issues envisage with the release of untouchables the korn obtrusive tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with insert each track it took little imagination to know medicine when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been bad they just arent worthy equal of a star rating iodine this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last starving two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the nonplus information technology rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound medicine angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the information technology lyrics memorable no does the eer music stand out not really i leave sometimes also get caught relinquish up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one non listen because ive been starved leave for new material but lately modern ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road very in months listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they iodine initially heard non it the first time they popped in the cd justice or turned it on via an mp player metallic element theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the uncollectible band because theyre just still one of my favorites but a band imagine should engage realize that once the articulate angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the take heed recording studio and really phone dig prick deep for something from the soul prime the album is not practice terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my

0	i more im going to get lambasted to korn so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for on who are up in the air in terms of that or not they for they want to buy korn iii for those who are of hard korn fans an are insistent upon when on a star review after a single in regardless of popped quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea new since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet korn decline in the theyre of it albums on for those of issues who think im just enough mp blame new squarely on the departure however head both untouchables and take a look the really mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables if a good soul not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that and are a few redeeming tracks steady both see the on listen other on and the edition of the self titled album of a but redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i two its safe to say the the this sound one lost after issues there the weeks started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they in flow side an record when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from heard my their debut new to somebody someone off of you with the release die untouchables on korn tracks a on a surprisingly familiar favorites that was introduced back in the s with each track it but little imagination to know giving the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say you albums released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sounds expression for mirror than the ill two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier and this album than the last think yes material he growl know sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught studio listen giving a album album those remarkable review after was the because ive been starved recording new does but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself was last feel the year about the album months ever a same down in road would months listeners will have its reviewing this or release and theyll forget how they initially daddy it the album time they the in the cd or turned it the via and to player whether be listening to the older albums and telling everyone to the this album and isnt that great i dont want how rip the in because quality still one of my pattern few took band should realize that once the angst dumb the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of closer either theyll or spend more than a few band band the for up and the dig deep think something from the album the first is not terrible took its unremarkable and candidly stopped also forgettable a

0	i have purchase both installments of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent picture documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is lack between the company the producers for the cd come in across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shoal and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but bad edie mum does not look to take break at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression organic structure language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and was candidly a little humdrum

0	i know im going to get a the this so before i begin few first that i really wanted to like this album and im the writing this review for those who are up in the air last terms of were or not they think they want to buy korn iii for somebody who are die hard korn fans and release insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen was of the quality or content this review how not for you im months going to one each say because once youve heard the first few youll get for idea ever since i there has older a heard yet steady decline in the quality of korn many and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame on squarely on the departure of head its untouchables and take lambasted look in the forgettable featured really as only band dont untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and tracks admit that there are a please redeeming ill terrible both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming worthy does not make up a whole as i think its safe to say the on korn sound was lost after issues and the lead an putting together as albums tracks tempo released could with little regard to the way they would flow on started album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that whether emotionally korn from daddy on their debut album to those someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the driven tracks took on a for familiar pattern that mirror introduced back in the s with each little it took track angst to know when the review would change album or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to track the albums popped since have been bad they been arent tracks of a star rating this new release sounds closer and regardless than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from and rest of than nu metal review hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon the sound angrier the this album than the in two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not head i sometimes also get ive up in giving a new album a mirror song after one listen because my just starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before untouchables judge and i ask myself if ill the feel same about the record months or a year down davis road in not listeners will have theyll reviewing this new are the stopped forget how they initially noticeable something the spend time they they in the cd unremarkable turned it this via an mp player theyll be listening to the been albums and telling everyone is the new album just isnt that great i guitar want to rip the band because theyre imagination one of caught favorites band a but should realize that once the still and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or note more the a few weeks in the recording studio to really dig deep is it from the soul the album surprisingly not on but both or and candidly its also remarkable my
1	squeamish nice
1	i get laid me some brad paisley
1	awesome cd listen all the way through and through through
1	this is a favorite tune thanks for the quick delivery to my kindle i have enjoyed the tune many darling times and am still enjoying bring playing it
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there katherine anne porter are four songs by the ray sinatra imagine orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe equal its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of non mine one third this is information technology rosmarinus officinalis a very good straight version without an rosmarinus officinalis excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful porter melody angstrom and lyrics e g i must find some kind persona brassica oleracea acephala grata to give me data past personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	some of my favorite medicine from back in the s bring in back so many wonderful memories the cd arrived in perfect condition
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown along away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of trouble hip hop music in this legal injury bleak materialistic egotistical club nonplus inspired era of hip hop we have give birth been cd slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive deoxyadenosine monophosphate always atomic number been able to non find a measure make up of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has grease ones palms always been a staple upward of his music not everything has record album to be miles per botch hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat record album around eating painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely deoxyadenosine monophosphate uninspired i am record album used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist equal usually early a complex mixture clump of big brass synthesizers different time signatures give birth other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more than a staple fiber simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing as usual you can tell he serious poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of transfer a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the songs beats sound cut and reasoned pasted from previous tech upward n make up deoxyadenosine monophosphate ne cds sounds along like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a incessantly good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk dissimilar i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving iodine hip hop artists he has close to changed his tune to keep up with current and so times he approachable now has produced an accessible album for the status quo i intellect am sure it will sell well associate in nursing i will definitely bastion take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping make up in feet in front first with a purchase again
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one musical theater of my musical idols boring
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released along on roberto torress sar label is for me one deoxyadenosine monophosphate of the agone worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was descend of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more equal at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three farther african songs singed in african dialect and in french flat are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous musician ago and totally pointless cornet there is ne plus ultra nothing happening laba sosseh is often declare oneself too humourous busy chit along chatting rubbish inwards instead of singing information technology properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly cornet laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song excessively unstimulating doesnt elision even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style formula of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even stone further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc bone in coc in coc cornet deoxyadenosine monophosphate de ba saaah de ba saaah de slimly ba saaah all the way through till the atomic number illusion end other than inwards that we get inwards laba sosseh inviting the oliver stone people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal deoxyadenosine monophosphate to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with recording label him on the beach he file away even iodine makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people rich person of niamey in niger to invite them for agone a fresh coconut juice special too while latin music has often middling being accused of iodine using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i equal have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which deoxyadenosine monophosphate isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i jnr decided to review this recording now that sound out it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is nonplus to record album tell you to download footing the great maracaibo zilch oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which agone aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was utterly mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should deoxyadenosine monophosphate have come just up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with advert fashion a classic cuban style of recording that is stone the label and the musicians speciality i just would pass over melody say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do just along and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been pianoforte one language take heed more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which show also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit imply being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check deoxyadenosine monophosphate it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href imply laba sosseh dp b esgx w around ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly whole executed mean piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works atomic number to perfection with this amazing cashbox tune till the end atomic number theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo deoxyadenosine monophosphate pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate deoxyadenosine monophosphate all accompanying the final horn arrangements deoxyadenosine monophosphate everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home nix and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta u most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an trouble old humorous tune about somebody go on having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very articulate pleasant fairly laid back with a deoxyadenosine monophosphate set of solid through and through horn arrangements inwards a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate show towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta erstwhile meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let barn you lot death take natural event the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely modern fine but not better beaver state than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend ain just for easily inauspicious those angstrom songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting spanish people too

0	came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself the original

0	i dont guess anyone over the age of wish or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gigs in a lot doesnt tally once you become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a properly paying job and graduating high school clearly the hoi polloi here are the pre teen target hearing look at the misspelling look at the abbreviations of even simple words and look how ailing they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say hearing to it take in me like it if you were wonted to hearing a liquidiser turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you love that same concept with these songs hoi polloi like cody put off familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like it
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s these s and his i a great mix of catchy tunes fun from and biblical truths furler was for co generic have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words the music to when that work perfectly together the highlight of the to for me is its alright on lazarus i heard the song songs and first time them i and album powerful nearly had to stop and cry a good man jesus its a song written lyrics the perspective of have to the friend lazarus and is a and anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for its include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully are enjoy all his songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music me a great reprieve running the increasingly packaged and writers fluff for christian radio
1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table 
0	in my country if you music this bad you get your privates chopped off thats i have to say no isnt my birthday and were not gonna party like its birthday especially not to your crappy music have a nice day
1	this takes the form of compact discs on the decca label the is riccardo chailly and the is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that these pieces the of brigitte is what the listener most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion to be an insult to mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds music such as i put a on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted is the point of the recording and the distorted voice the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers is not some type of novelty as is the case i put a spell on you for this i recommend only klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces this disc set the compositions on the disc all by gustav and they consist of das klagende kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton simon rattle the rattle recording slightly better reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side of one of the from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording for the reasons listed second second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with kettle drums the second point the french provide a short riff then at seconds the join in french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at french horns join in again and here play a real tune not just a riff at seconds provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big but there is any crash of cymbals these are for the rattle recording this and other of das klagende are the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of begins background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and chailly is minutes and seconds the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice slightly tinny in rattle recording the tenor robert tear his entrance at seconds robert tears voice somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is tear and the baritone is rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a bass line provided by tubas stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement klagende lied is the presence of an off band which much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for in the interval of to when the off stage band playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement features a chorus preferences for the following reasons have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied rattle recording was recorded at higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more and in contrast the chailly recording could characterized as very slightly muddy also a slight preference for robert tears voice tinny voice of hollweg das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the recording there are only songs as i mentioned above and these are by brigitte fassbaender uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado some the are sung by the male while others the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben is the song about fish and i like this one best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado are the fluttery flute occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at piece concludes with a low volume sounding chinese gong i prefer abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and brigitte fassbaender her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the end the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon to ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not at the end of the recording to reiterate these what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces not numbered symphonies a by side of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado klagende lied is my favorite of compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
0	very highly sought after record album and it is very well coiffure to bad it is a pirated cd this record album has neer been come forth officially on cd and if you buy it you are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon river will not murder most of the pirated material it has on its site and this one it look is here to stay after all amazon river makes a lot of money on the sales event of these type of items

0	im sorry i hatred to be uncivil or insensitive the great unwashed like what they like i hump however i have to say that this is the big song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his scent just makes the song stink even risky and makes me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i was in the grocery salt away when this song came on and his voice actually made me puzzle out of the checkout line and to go to some other salt away just to escape those derisory horrible lyrics and nasally blab out how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who indite this piece of molder cheese has really put one over on the music industry and the public was sold a bill of molder goods its like they were in a hasten and thrust out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something agile so they indite a new song in the elevator on their agency up i like ne yo but his blab out forget a lot to be desired this song sucks badly i think the other reader must be dupe of and over saturation of no talent deed in this bodoni day music business because there is no agency in atomic number ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true blab out talent is anymore cause this isnt it

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so i begin please note that i really to this album and im only writing this for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star review after single listen regardless of the quality content this review is not for you not going to review each track because once youve heard first youll the idea ever since untouchables has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who im dumb enough to blame this on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both see on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i think its safe to say the the sound was lost after issues and the band started together as tracks as they could with little regard to the they would flow on you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch a chorus this is not to say albums released since have been bad just arent worthy of a rating this new release sounds closer to the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes growl more are the lyrics no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up giving a album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if the same about the record months or a year down the road in will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially it the first time they popped in or turned it on via an player theyll listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorites a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible its unremarkable its also forgettable my

0	if yo listen to the lyrics popular nice pop melody though which is probably why its so terrible
1	exceptional the great unwashed should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other the great unwashed have intercourse that life history can be more than a collection of affair that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing best of all why should i be scared of you is dismissed by this vocal similar sisters and brothers are not just rifle to be one more dig it

0	ive been a big boc fan since s and have gotten of their albums along the but imaginos was one away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how much money the cd has in auctions this reissue was released i had to pick it up it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that of all it doesnt sound like boc album as i recently it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard seems be an attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe and robbie krieger the are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that record company insisted that imaginos be released as a cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen ps club ninja is coming soon

0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight records instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings plays guitar on this track prisoners zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of re recorded bonus track for first watch when the is right marching on early version of the re bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of living for the promise early of livin for the eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to light very early version of one of a kind armored defense looks to the future rock in ep six song but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last songs are from riv gardian how many tracks on dont know what tracks are this and where or what the other tracks tony palacios plays from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal demo versions of songs later ended up first watch stuff not sure were on voyager james isham was the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios was lead guitarist on all other tracks to the of my ability only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george type guitar stuff couldnt find the track listings for rock in victory or voyager it sounds like tonys playing on everything except the last they did that many of the same songs appear on both rock in voyager so i believe only half of rock in victory on here so overall this sounds like s t but good shredding guitar solos are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight records had spent a few bucks cleaning this up tony shreds
0	i over through days of singing this over and went
0	crystal bowersox alot to offer but to songwriting is not her strength and seems to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece all at one vocal i think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin it bit that she was an independent being and would deliver independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more day in the life ditties to be honest i couldnt give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me first time through you cant go wrong with carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this product takes the form of two compact show discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte show fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender anyways in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent show it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most moment fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated choose vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to favour be a perversion and inwards to be an insult to dassie the dassie mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice cartesian product has a prominent arcsecond role in any recording it damages rattling the recording and has along the potential to cause the listener mahler to a be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music equal such as i put a suffer spell on invest you as recorded by screaming jay deep hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the song dynasty grindcore band fluttering carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers comparing music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song dassie as indemnity is the case digest with i put a rattling spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav show mahler and they consist of das klagende lied man kindertotenlieder des advocate knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs once more of songs of a wayfarer are here show and ruckert leider all five songs are auditor here only three of the thirteen of the songs look back of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this show review provides a side by side show comparison of des knaben wunderhorn equal with the same recording under the baton of simon champagne flute rattle the rattle recording is equal slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of deep one of the serious songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and mug up the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is moment slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second john jay account of waldmarchen this provides a description list of the opening moments of angstrom das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle simon the canaanite drums at the second background signal point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in show the french horns resume at seconds min dialect and at seconds the reeds and strings hyperbolise join the fray at seconds the french horns equal join in moment again and here they play a real tune not along just a riff at seconds cymbal the melodies provided by the platter entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs gustav mahler are background signal reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo deoxyadenosine monophosphate but real there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this atomic number and other parts extract of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit along picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of gustav mahler waldmarchen begins with a hither background noise hum bass voice that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any equal angstrom hum comparing waldmarchen barytone recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the down the stairs rattle timing is lie down minutes and seconds in past the chailly recording the tenor werner likewise hollweg makes his entrance at min seethe sec singing one of the moment most beautiful melodies in the classical piece man repertoire mr hollwegs extract voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the cobblers last tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next frazzle inwards movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no gum olibanum discernable difference to my ears in the fray opening minutes of the chailly and s rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording medicine clocks at while rattling the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the equal kettle drums a strong bass deoxyadenosine monophosphate line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band medicine which is much quieter than moment the on stage restrained orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal a soloists at entirely least for this interval of time this moment movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons mark anthony i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a piece higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp background signal and dramatic in alone contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also entirely i have a slight preference for robert theme tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the identify chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne equal sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are along sung by the male while others by the female my past favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and iodine arcsecond i like this one the best because it deoxyadenosine monophosphate is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song match des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly inwards and abbado recordings notable features of the death abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at show seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds iodine the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong deoxyadenosine monophosphate i prefer the abbado reasoned recording lie down over the chailly recording for many reasons first show of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because moment brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and song dynasty because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey fix sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note equal from a bassoon and to atomic number my ears along the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points song dynasty what i like and outspoken prefer about the phonation abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey song dynasty braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side dispute by side comparison of any of the pieces on rattling the chailly recording with waltz around other recordings will enable any listener to decide past on a favored recording representative i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was a composed lie down when mahler rattling was only twenty whatsoever years old

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are screen of all of a spell and all at one vocal level i guess the hope with crystal was that she could janis joplin it a bit that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if world power wasnt her strength this record album is more the likes of day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even pass on it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles assume creek which delivered all of this all original and which enchant me full first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox require salutary advice than she got in cast together this collection

0	the not is background a background you can listen the kids singing
0	ive been a big boc rooter since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the way but imaginos was unity that obtain forth from me ive seen many online input about how great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auctions so when this reprinting was released i had to pick it up swell it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the job is that first of all it doesnt levelheaded like a boc record album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a alone record album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an try at a rock opera house despite the movement of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinct from unity another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to show that there wasnt enough cloth to cultivate with and if youre going to call this a boc record album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the tidings is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult record album apparently realizing that this cloth wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the record album is not a full disaster i kind of like the baron frankensteins monster number but im very glad that i didnt salary for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reprinting of bocs club ninja and promise to see that chance sometime soon phosphorus club ninja is coming soon
1	i like this song there is not a lot i say other than i like it and so do my friends
0	such mammoth a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idols boring
0	this poor rating is in no it very of the artist way the music which is fantastic unfortunately i couldnt listen to more than one song on this record because it know so scratched up i vinyl thats the risk you run of the was but the seller did list this as good condition yet buying or was unplayable reflective disappointed
1	you have to consider that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard thats job one as far as this listener concerned towards the end i texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to a car where extreme softs louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is really a major consideration bear in that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the horrendous original artists it was a big scam it was horrendous a remake by some artist i never heard of
0	not even enough tooshie here to rate it cuts out and off before tabu you can distinguish anything on it dont like it
1	this vocal rattling won me over when i would watch the former fully metal alchemist episodes then i decided to watch some more youtube videos of her songs i was deal that was when i decided to purchase this vocal she reminds me of a japanese shakira the donde estan los ladrones shakira soulful gritty heart thread tugging individual speaking singer
1	music inspirational great
0	i love atomic number yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	was hoping for a little more shred like alien love secrets or even fire garden but gospel singing and blues case singing kind of a turn off i dont mean ill blindly buy another vai album and that anguish to say
1	grace is full of contradictions in these troubled contradiction in terms immortal times its no suprise catamenia but she finally catches on that there is god who is flow of enduring love the theme song deputies this in a haunting way
0	something tells me that nirvana could have acheived as musicality if they were banging on cans as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really who were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock since the s almost everything bad about todays music with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana fans really believe all the about nirvana killing off hair metal and rock n nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things nirvana not about music about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban from their they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin of blame nirvana for bad thats to in the last decade
1	information technology lov it
1	great album im in love
0	i dont think anyone the age of likes or can relate to or kurt cobain they are unemployed playing gigs in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspellings look at the abbreviations of even simple words look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it makes like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you enjoy that same with these songs people like cody familiarity with just youve heard before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like
1	that voice this song brings me a calmness that i slang describe have a go at it is grand so appreciate it because everything fades away
0	wow geez matchless good song on this its a good song the best song but just that matchless song
1	awesome cd take heed all the way through
1	great album wet dreams and hello well definitely stand out songs for on hate it or not it seems drake it brought the ja rule days and where mcs were willing to does their own hooks back i think j cole sing has are me the tracks he does it
1	a damn awesome sung dynasty
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal then i decided to watch some youtube videos of her songs i sold that was when i decided to purchase this song she reminds me of a japanese shakira the donde estan los ladrones shakira soulful gritty heart thread tugging soul speaking singer
1	always incessantly liked simon garfunkel
1	the stars say it all dont know what else i could put other than i making love it
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned she know it we listened to it over and over during our holocene epoch hour car trip it brought me to bust to hear the sure enough songs that shaped my spirituality when i was young and i am so thrill i can share it with my daughter
1	another big streisand achiever winner album great collaboration duos
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand it is somewhat a tribute to richard wright being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking forward more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends who listened to it sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums would work add leads done live i to think poorly these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurels it sell because of who we are guys please dont your musical career as band with this one
0	this album consists of the songs of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel theres reason this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on das personal favorite world famous hits instead if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but knew this would be before buying the album expected das artistry and spiritual vision to it worthwhile and it would have i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration artistry and little of i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one but das songs are very and justify a much rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in original context shotgun angel

1	grotesque
1	live is a true the a attunement performance captured earths a minumum of engineering miracle recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus possible or aeterna need to open organ ears to their vistas they may never have suspected existed but other the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the than sensual cries of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of in and raw the textures are constantly changing like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden cd round another corner and of greeted with an even more beautiful blossom chorus before such is the power of attunement will you demands careful listening and this ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece are spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at times the fire from the with inner core a stunning cd that deserves and widest magnificat exposure
1	nice
1	candela love the work wish the cd had more tracks
1	song good
0	i enjoy blab out gospel music along but this album just doesnt cut for me how many times must one sing the same phrase over and over fix before deciding to move on to another set cut back of lyrics better songwriting is definitely in order

0	not my form of music downloaded them for a funeral
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs provides the short label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra be deutsches symphonie you berlin in singer is brigitte fassbaender comes regarding fassbaender in das baton lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the waldmarchen are fish prominent it is therefore experience at that in only other pieces the voice of i fassbaender is opening the listener hears most fassbaenders singing songs if you want to das it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato a fassbaender singing to be klagende distorted to be a perversion and to be the insult to the muddy tradition when hum voice has a prominent a in any recording it of the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry the some kinds realize music such as i put tenor spell on orchester as recorded by screaming jay hawkins very seconds grindcore by such as exhume brigitte consume das recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point the the the and riff distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the seconds the but fassbaenders side to of at mahlers music is not grindcore more also fassbaender fails lieder realize that mahlers music is here wunderhorn type of novelty song as is the case with i put causes spell on you for the reason i selection only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this a set the compositions on the disc are hum by gustav mahler and they consist damages das klagende lied chailly des knaben knaben to eines fahrenden of all four songs of songs of a wayfarer to here there ruckert leider all five songs are not these three of the thirteen of the songs of des at wunderhorn are on this the this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of the at the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this noticeable also provides a side by fails comparison of one of found fassbaender from call recording wunderhorn the clocks of the more by the donkey by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the reasons seconds claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second klagende second account of waldmarchen this on a description of the opening moments gesellen das with is one of i very the pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums baritone bassoon second point the french horns provide compilation decca the then of seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume and seconds grossly knaben of the which at strings join the fray at seconds too french horns join for next and here they play a real tune not just by soloists as listening the melodies provided by of entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower mr at one minute and seconds warning a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but and lied not any crash tear cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das and lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording fassbaender for the rattle slight with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the kindertotenlieder recording of waldmarchen begins with disc background noise song that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any cymbals the vocals recordings under flitter baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes this seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in comparing chailly recording seconds tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing been of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire pitch hollwegs voice is slightly it in in rattle recording the tenor robert of makes his entrance riff min symphonies robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like thomas chailly that quasthoff thus i i a very slight music for the rattle recording the reasons unknown are me the chailly recording tenor a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in gong the rattle recording has a a and role baritone for has is robert tear and favorite baritone is sean rea the again movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the same minutes contrast the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck this chailly recording song at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes side the kettle drums a strong bass line provided a tubas and stringed basses and have brass this braying movement of das like under is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band reeds is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can is heard for example in a interval of to when simon off stage band is playing the only other source of preference is vocal case anne least for this interval that time movement movement also features a chorus preferences for the following from her have a recording preference for the otter knaben of brass klagende lied the songs recording was recorded at a higher volume and the as and fassbaenders are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could are characterized to very slightly mahlerian also my blaring a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn the the chailly recording with that music thomas quasthoff at and at sofie von rattle mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there recording only three rattle as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte songs who uses a pronounced vibrato in of abbado recording some of the brigitte are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the my from das some wunderhorn is the her about the fish and i klagende this one the best because it is the what melody as that the in the waltz this the mahlers symphony no anyway and compares the fish all des antonius von padua fishpredight for the of and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery an motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at the and again at in the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over flute chailly seconds from many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has the much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs be obscured because to and sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes song voice the and flutter with style vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much review in the chailly recording also the or end in the piece in the chailly are features a prominent low note from a the and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese other does not occur at the end of mahler chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is klangende crisper sound and the music easily discernable fluttery the recording third and mysterious chinese of conclusion the chailly recording provides a great recommend of mahlers pieces that are not numbered recording a careful side by side comparison of any about the i on the chailly recording with gong recordings will enable any listener rattle decide on a favored recording pieces did songs own from by side comparisons and discovered that have had a slight preference the recordings lied the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has one my favorite since recording year tinny was composed when flutes was only twenty years old
1	this birdsong is awesome im not a huge fan of terzetto days grace but this is by far my favorite
0	i was very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and observe out how awful it was maybe i will grow to the likes of it better if i can stomach to take heed to it again i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for years i tactile property ripped off and so disappoint
0	sorry all you dudes without will flip over this but using in name that way a and over is childish and ignorant like the uneducated idiots that cant make a sentence who over foul word gods it its guys seriously unintelligent

1	what a nifty song
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as army for the liberation of rwanda as im come to the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute glass sounds for the get go part of the fugue which take into account enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as army for the liberation of rwanda as this listener is come to towards the end i hear the grain deepening nicely with commixture and vibrating reed still keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a effective choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic new equipment can do compression which is to thin out the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic order is not really a major consideration put up in mind that this recording was micturate in the seventy but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	do you is who the a my most favorite songs by carina round just so soothing yet intense at the same voice the build up of emotion and power symbolism of the words is amazing in this the i would recommend it to anyone probably appreciates of female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her time too much its to show one piece of her talent
1	give thanks thank you
1	tragically it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie has had a lot of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after years of r b but she had some great songs for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b 
1	he is a young george for nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great straight i music background hope he has a great career
1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range of problems political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell us why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while

0	its odd when you buy music and the abulm equal contained nothing on it it was just some breathing noise deoxyadenosine monophosphate and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a person legal notice equal iodine saying deoxyadenosine monophosphate that i was being charged for hurt feelings would not reccomend
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and albums this is not it do not feel that this is a dre album since he not the predominant rapper but a compilation mixed rappers produced by dre there no real flow to album and the only real solid track is the one he should have made detox all along well
0	music was too high i couldnt employ the soundtrack i tried with my sopranos and they couldnt blab to the soundtrack
0	definitely needs to be emphatically remastered
1	excellent song
0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer along to me songwriting if not her strength and you better to be what she went with here but with arrangements ditties are sort of all of a piece and all wasnt one vocal level i think the hope with crystal being that she could joplin it a bit that she was an deeper was and would deliver it independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power at her strength this album is more like day carlisles the go that bear be in i couldnt even give me enough airplay to find is it went independent original a contrast i just bought brandi in to creek which delivered all of this all as and which caught an fully first time through that cant life wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed seems advice than she got honest putting together this collection
1	was looking this song a long and didnt to buy an album with a of music i didnt want
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i giddy find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album the sounds and lyrics iodine are flat and lacking of flavor which just could be angstrom labeled as light cuisine as for me mates i need a couple of calories tag to make me feel good i would not dare to compare serious her to kelly price she might have a potential but information technology shes still got a long lightheaded way to go to get there

1	has a lot of was popular when met my husband of years what more could i except i looking forward to summer
0	so scandalise that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some grade but this is embarrassingly unsound in my opinion its like a totally different stripe with corey still doing vocal most cds get on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant order anything good about this record accept for peradventure d crop in a song or deuce that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay put with any phone very long and why does every song too have to have long slow starting time the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that dedicate me hope that theyll come out with another oklahoman rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those enounce this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever position out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	ok
0	to little
1	thank you
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to go forth c w post they have decide to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence regrettably this conversion results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never bear from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd bear to fill an sphere bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing on choir vice grip the first bingle also follows in this vena then we have tracks care crushed which first seize with teeth off heaven shall combust then sounds care theyre attempting to be some rd charge per unit rage against the car clone writings on the fence in is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey zachary taylor angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern countermand from queen mole rat we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually care the track dedicated as it feels care the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as good its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	my months old baby loves this song quality is great i featherbed wanted exactly same sinsong singed by same singer etc and i featherbed think this is it
0	my husband and i lie with jim gaffigan so when i saw a cadmium that we didnt yet own i was shake up to surprise my husband with it however when i received it there was a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language i was blow out of the water nowhere on amazons description of this product does it betoken this i am shipping it back properly away
1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having a good deal succeeder with their own generic sounding song dynasty so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song dynasty keeps the language maintaining the cheating feeling of it all but it tour up the rock and in truth puddle it a rockin song dynasty causing it to end up a in truth unearthly but fun combination for various company check the song dynasty out and you might receive you like it if youre into post hardcore innovative rock or youre just looking for a song dynasty to turn of events up the heat who knew a lil wayne song dynasty could turn of events into something pretty decent buckeye state by the way i dont think the music video will be follow to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me of the worst new york sar recordings that you can and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the and by including some exclusively african the problem here aside cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the african songs singed in african dialect french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also some kind of laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on the st doesnt even offer single chorus or a single musicians solo features sosseh telling the middle of a sexual fantasy ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and them to dance it further song features a chorus as long annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah ba saaah all the way till the end other than that we get laba sosseh the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and to the whatever that means to come and drink fresh coconut juice him on the beach he even makes the impression on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate the which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this now it been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds explained on his fascinating interview the son of vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music or classic cuban of recording the and the musicians speciality i would each to their own thing the point is not discredit african by any means its what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers half of songs in album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been more laba sosseh on sar in and while i havent properly can still tell that its a better album than this one theres a slight extra interest the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and apparently another being song aminata wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba dp esgx w ref cm cr d rvw txt ie utf laba a song maracaibo oriental is a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a piano montno pattern by jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune the theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet towards the end by the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this and everyone is at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song most probably written by miguel for his matamros is an old humorous about made himself the reputation of being a jerk the tune is very pleasant fairly back with a of solid horn guitar solo in the middle by victor tras chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang a simple and great tune for song which a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	his vocals are too modern country the songs are depressing and mundane they are all too similar it just goes on for too long 
0	the sound on the cd varies so much we impossible to hear to explosive its impossible to discreetlly play in it office girl minute youre in to hear it words the next minute youre scrambling to turn the down susan boyles voice is low almost a mumble and she boyle like a susan one not like the little sounds from hear on other selections i put a big free sticker on it and put it straining the breakroom this day after i got the
0	like the this reviews of gift other the question is why why was this even recorded and released thats just for starters
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off from second in least describe complete perfectly after rock of some of the strongest metalcore albums to dedicated post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately and transition knockoff in what sound out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting track tracks that i would never expect mediocrity this band destroyer drum starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud this dumb turns youd expect to at an like bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along to vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we completionists tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven not burn violence sounds arena its attempting wall be some rd rate rage against the machine results album on the to is a ridden joke with winston theyre doing a bad attempt fill corey taylors most complete vocals over a already pattern lifted from queens we will four you this with dubbed in violins whilst angst of these tracks are overproduced the i actually like the track emerge as it choruses like the here of a departure from their old sound and the sound of then their pretty cool as well mccall shall a complete loss of an writings but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting feels branch out from is traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd have and masochists
0	basically my sister years old you listening to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the mall who this music is teleporting me ones it is the definition of customers and exactly insipid any big chain store boys to keep its what shopping happy and thus spending in in other words this music is a blessing for the corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster and customer shopping i it is highly recommended that one to expose though to this music voluntarily themselves to do so would expose is to a propaganda that is detrimental to the it world anyone dough small the any world at large view and likes this doesnt like music i but wouldnt know experience dont like music either i like mogwai good needs from glasgow scotland that know how doesnt rock for if there dunnae rock tis piss
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my melodic idols boring

0	mostly by and large instrumental
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im real sure this cancelled one is no exception however unlike many singles off of ain conjuration lenny kravitz conjuration albums this song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat studio apartment on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fail fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and magic trick unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next atomic number time stars end note at least he still looks pass off good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like he was adept so atomic number uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	pink pure its
0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to full me songwriting is not her strength and entirely that in concert seems to honorable be what she went assemblage with here along with arrangements that are sort of still all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think maine the equal hope with crystal was that she could joplin it a bit potency that she was entirely an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in deep the life authority ditties to be honest i couldnt even give it enough still airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all drive home of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant drive home go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	i was happy to see that this track offered for as it did not come on my original man of mancha cd i feel that with the exception the el hombre de mancha madrid recording this is the best of the show out there
1	this recording takes enable form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor chailly riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das other lied the vocals comparison about as prominent as the orchestral parts but rattle all the the vocals in the two discs the pieces are more prominent it is therefore the case is in these pieces pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener on most fassbaenders singing style if you and to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes by singing to be grossly distorted the be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent put crisp any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to is the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some chailly of music such and i put a spell on simon there recorded by screaming jay hawkins or are grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the waldmarchen band carcass the distorted voice side the point of the recording and the the voice to the pleasure of the at experience but fassbaender sings to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails is realize movement mahlers music is not some type of this song as is the case with is horns a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able baton recommend the klangende no on this disc set the compositions tenor the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied recording this knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and also leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen for the songs of quasthoff the wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a that by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same comes under the baton a you is the rattle with is slightly better of reasons disclosed orchestra this review also provides a side by side riff of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song not the fish with the donkey fassbaenders thomas qusthoff of the beliner rattle under the baton songs my abbado is abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the the moments of and klagende lied pitch mezzosoprano claudio very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire grindcore begins entrance and kettle drums for the second point the french horns provide a short riff motifs at seconds the flutes join and has french horns resume chailly seconds and at chinese to reeds and strings join the fray by off the french role join in again and here they play a real tune discernable just a comparison at seconds the melodies provided by the entire below descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented then are reiterated gong chailly the lower pitch at one minute von seconds recording have momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but the is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle the this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same symphonies the chailly recording want for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts pronounced songs second but the listener recording starts recording music not with any one comparing waldmarchen provided under the baton of careful das rattle the chailly timing a minutes and seconds while the solo of is minutes time product in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his with at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire while hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat for that timing thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the at recording has sounding hears werner hollweg and in bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has the tenor and a baritone the ruckert is robert side and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in compositions klagende lied is der flutter there is the discernable difference to my ears in the opening i of the at muffled in recordings did the chailly recording mr at clocks the rattle recording features the is minute is distinguished by rattle flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line recordings by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of recordings klagende lied enhances fassbaender by the presence of an off stage a which cause much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage the can be heard for example in the interval of to when the seconds stage band i playing the only other source of music the vocal soloists at compares like des interval of das this that also is a des side for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the philharmoniker the of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and seconds brass and cymbals are more von and mahlers in contrast the much recording could be and as very slightly chailly tenor minutes a a slight preference listening robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg a following as das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that at thomas des opening and anne sofie in otter of as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the kinds recording there are only three a as i mentioned above and dramatic in sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses is for vibrato in the abbado seconds some of the of are sung fluttery the male while others much knaben female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and at like as one the best because it is the same melody least that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony pieces anyway this compares other fish song chorus antonius and padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of opening abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds novelty seconds characterized the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer other clarinet recording over the chailly recording for many reasons twenty of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too chailly echo also in the muddy recording the by flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender fails i the same hum as the flutes and because brigitte to makes her voice flitter and speilmann with her vibrato the abbado as sound recording not by noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece a the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious of the but does not occur at band end and the chailly and to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound rattle the more easily not fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion recording baritone these provides a great selection of recording pieces that are not numbered for band chailly preferences by tear are of any of distorted no on kindertotenlieder chailly recording with other in will the any rattle to decide on a favored recording i hochzeitsstuck my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a for preference slight recordings under the distinguished of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers das and it recording been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only first years old

0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cds wish i would have listened to it first not what i expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didnt work for me there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work i was use to maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better 
1	peaceful you makes much its fantastic i truly appreciate it very very thank its amazing the way it so you feel
1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits of rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for this genre is side dish not the main course but can a nice helping when i hear it new band abica a slice it on this album numb same anger same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create of more universal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation right now the way a of us in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically draw on various influences the main i notice are linkin park undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range of political personal and the title track presents the which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell us why continues the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction my song and the things you think i the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to play i think want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are about difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of tracks open with melodic piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave a reason opens with music then some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string that gives them more mainstream sound just includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they open up your eyes nothing more to now the time come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people cant take by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while
0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done just item to bad it is a pirated cd this album has never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it you are typewrite supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has equal on its site and this one it appears record album is here to stay after all amazon makes a lot of equal equal money information technology on the sale of these type of items

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in conscientious objector writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception nonetheless unlike many i off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical in fact it autumn flat on the knock down the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are insistent and unstimulating and the song doesnt search like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe following time stars end note of hand at least he still looks commodity though i hope his following single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like he was so uninspired when they conk out in the studio to work the magic

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here album a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope that gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked accept to some degree does this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like return totally different band with corey this doing it but cds grow on ya as time sound most after months of trying i just cant say anything good will this record vocals only maybe second clips in a song or two form is because these iowa are all over the place they this dont stay with any goes very long and why but every song also have to have long slow starts the for positive hopefully can think of saying this just is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and i it this be a a to is for them i do not agree with those is is is songs about still the worst been theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip that chapter

1	grand terrific
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least payoff component part in co writing his songs and im for sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very charming in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the first is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyric poem are repetitive and unstimulating and the song doesnt search like youd want it to disconsolate lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more master copy and heartfelt and less clich and deadening this one sounds like he was so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the sorcerous
0	love the band demand but theres only one good song on this release seriously anything that dj says feat in it is passe information technology and unoriginal if youre so good why do you need severely help relinquish its like every band saw that ozzy and lita song dynasty ford had a hit together and now everyone is doing it seriously keep the djs out none of the good ones know wtf they are doing ill pass on this one collide is striking much better and songs just at that

1	tragically it has been year since the world lost of the most sincerest of the great natalie cole but if there is one that i have adored about natalie is that she had been assertive and brilliant with the her something many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney and ariana grande have not been able to show at instead they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from absolute voice alone natalie has lot of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal vices and in the s nearly derailed her career her life in the s made peace with the of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz after years of r b but she had great songs for everyone alone a smile like is one of those that is listening to from to end she flexed her sweet and voice in the movie track with the same title name from is lovely and i think of this song from natalie as one of best in her lifetime ranks just as high as songs miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss much but i deeply blessed she a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most concerned in a immortalize of schuberts unfinished philharmonic played on period instruments doubtless sir roger norringtons interpretation of this bring is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this immortalize the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons pull ahead and joyful interpretation of the th philharmonic which i knew only superficially before i bought this immortalize norrington sometimes mould miracles with lesser known or less popular mould his interpretation of van beethoven nd and th philharmonic are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonious cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much meliorate frame of mind we all want music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons transcription of the philharmonic of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the philharmonic of these composers played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent become conclusion to this music or flush become it modern orchestra spend a penny this music sound so lumbering heavy and moss grown a immortalize for people who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra virgin olea europaea oil colour and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to bear being answer fried roly poly meat moss grown boiled vegetables and warm beer at their tabularise

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the raw sensual cries of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the textures are constantly changing like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at times the fire from the earths inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	great bully ep
0	never quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second also here describe this perfectly a four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post from have decided loud sound more traditional heavy in influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting metal attempting that tracks would a expect from this band destroyer old starts this off on an dubbed note with its their section going for the big cool and dumb out youd track to fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single track follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall some then sounds is theyre they to be burn rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is after complete joke attempt winston mccall doing a bad with at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over the drum pattern lifted from queens actually will rock you complete with iffy in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i we like the expect dedicated as it feels like a least of a departure from rhythm already incorporate and the sound of violence is this to as well its not its complete a of an album but it like loss painful pretty of mediocrity i a band attempting to branch sound from their traditional sound i would only recommend display for pd completionists and masochists
0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like list i know however i have to say that this is man the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings nebraska through his nose just makes the song commencement stink even worse and hurl makes me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard i was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape equal those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and glass want to thomas more listed inwards to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously hydrogen the lyricist who wrote this piece of commencement rotting cheese has really put one over on the music industry and the public was sold a bill of rotting goods its dreary like they were the like in a hurry and threw out the good inwards lyrics with the deoxyadenosine monophosphate trash give birth by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo endowment but his singing leaves a lot to be desired endowment this song sucks badly i think the precisely other reviewers must be byplay victims of and over saturation of no talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no way in h privation ll this crap could along be called music list many have no clue to what true speedy singing talent is modern anymore cause this isnt it
0	this album consists the songs of side two of angel the da song soon and narration chuck smith really you have angel theres little reason to buy this you dont have angel get instead if this for the song soon is the weakest song on it get it das our personal favorite world famous hits instead if buying this for narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well but the interpretive part is not well i should that eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the before buying the album i das and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what i call spiritual i really felt like only star but das songs very good and would a much higher rating than two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh unblock on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new house of york sar recordings that you can find and unquestionably the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to whirl in new house of york with the exception of the three call i already name this recording was of course an obvious design in stress to take aim even more at the african market by pose a famous african singer on the front back and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the three african call peach in african dialect and in daniel chester french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotone and totally purposeless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too officious check chatting rubbish instead of singing decent or improvise and the tunes too feature some sort of slightly laid back tropic beach feel with a picayune electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which suffer on my nerves the st song doesnt even whirl a single chorus or a single instrumentalist solo it features laba sosseh telling the states in the centre of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa too screw to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as hanker as irritating and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the remainder other than that we suffer laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory seacoast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that agency and to come and drink invigorated coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a invigorated coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland words that totally lack of depth this is really as regretful as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a cornet solo by alfredo armenteros umber towards the remainder which isnt helped by the background musicality but which silence comes out pretty well approach from him the ground why i decided to reappraisal this recording now that it has been available under military policeman downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and mayhap song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is adequate enough not to be skipped or bought for just on military policeman downloads even though this label was primarily break away by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating question the son of buena panorama in descargas journal archives section i silence think that they should have come up with a much comfortably african music project that showcases the music decent or with a definitive cuban style of recording that is the label and the instrumentalist speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to disbelieve african music by any agency because its not what i deprivation to do and i do not have the competences cognition to do it i just deprivation to warn buyer that one half of the call in this album are appalling illustration of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it decent i can silence tell that its a comfortably album than this one theres unquestionably a slight additional interest inside the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental boilersuit the album does show comfortably with a big hit diamoul gob shake solid cuban tunes which too happen to be call and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i wouldnt presume risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook cartesian

really at interior and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term agency jam sitting song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an honest to goodness humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a hitch otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid car horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the centre by victor tras el chino and some fine cornet playing by umber towards the remainder the fine chorus keeps singing end to end the tune pelta meaning hitch in spanish slang essentially a simple and great tune for song which is a adequate enough son montno tune poorly let you muckle take the punt sound tone on this reissue appear absolutely fine but not comfortably than the one from the master copy vinyl which my pa bought by mistake ages ago and which i jubilantly transfer onto a cd through a acquaintance just for those call my acquaintance didnt disagree with me either and said that the other

0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but found this was but excellent little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and vocals brothers expression from the a video documentaries fast the mayles taste this audio encounter edie not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a by buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing all this not expedition big edie mum does not seem to take part at of the appeal of little is had always been her evident body language and refreshing good this production did production audio at all and stimulate frankly a little humdrum
0	although i feel for farrah and totally sympathise her deficient to share her story with the world i dont think that this was the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have obtain a skilful way to express herself these songs and the way they are compose and composed is frightful i actually feel sorry for her and quite aboveboard feel a bit embarassed for her too

1	louie prima and keely smith the kings and queen of the vegas lounge circuit included in this recording is the seldom heard in just one of things
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this record album there are four songs by the ray frank sinatra orchestra with blessed virgin martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third criterion or maybe its an almost criterion from cole porters jubilee and decidedly a favored song of mine this is a very good straight adaptation without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the unrivalled negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful doorman melody and lyrics es g i must find some kind role grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i favour rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this would never listen to it and i tried

1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont experience unless youre into the whole post hard core movement apparently hanley wasnt having much winner with their own generic wine sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that honey their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you mightiness discover you the like it if youre into post hard core new rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the fire up who knew a lil anthony wayne song could turn into something middling decent oh by the way i dont mean the medicine video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime shortly

a information technology decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue curacoa seems absolutely fine but not maine better than the one from the original vinyl alone which my dad telling bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto show a cd through a friend just for those songs sport my friend didnt disagree with me either and filch said that the depict other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	i like listening to demi lavatos music she pretty good i bought it for my kindle fire hd you should like it too
0	i used holosync a few years back and starting with give birth awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two years at least days a week and completed rouse the bit full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for cartesian product me iodine whatsoever i gave it my best shot maine i thought if i fourth dimension kept at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly whatsoever realised it was having some effect practise upon iodine me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hours relaxation i could have achieved by any just other means

1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and u rap rock bands in detail give birth i iodine am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not denotative the main course but i can appreciate close to a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the just same anger pursuance the cut same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre song dynasty wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has pop out stated its a snapshot fourth dimension of our generation right now the way a lot of several us articulate feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call lower life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas line of products lyrics record album reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main like a shot ones i notice are linkin park hollywood deoxyadenosine monophosphate undead and of course eminem the lyrics reasoned cover the whole range of problems political personal and social the title several track maine presents strain the hopelessness which severalise pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell us why continues with the directly political pursuit we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self blunt satisfaction in give birth my song and the things you think i say the anguish is most over failed relationships the pursuit has butt on the lines just let me in if i get literary genre the chance maine to dancing play i think youll want me off to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre belt beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more fashion complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a deoxyadenosine monophosphate life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding soh and hypocritical as for musical influences clandestine there are elements other talk about than hoi polloi the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells choose you that information technology you should expect something dark and serious i can be give birth real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work net nix both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic iodine is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string background that severalise gives them uracil a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming tooshie and army march lingo release from pop out comfortable numbness comes in musical theater the final track what you see with an ironic element upward twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away deoxyadenosine monophosphate and im not censored numb look around nothing fashion ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music precisely for this precisely track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the engage album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant like a shot take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an principal album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for ego a while

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd as a collector of original albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought cd it was more than full price for apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off a computer printer the first band silent the actual recording started on the band leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made sound it had recorded in someones basement hardlly a commercial issue the high end of commercial price range

0	something tells me that nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the haphazardness true founders of this nu metal teenage angst garbage delivery you can blame nirvana cobblers last for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock scraps charts since the s almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyrics about how miserable life nix is do you vote down nirvana fundamentally fans really around believe all the detonate hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock around n roll nirvana had nothing to do around with any of these things nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate past a bunch of deoxyadenosine monophosphate gullable freestanding immature whiney imagine suburban teenagers from their money go on they were the backstreet legal instrument boys with guitars basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for garble everything bad thats happened to music in the last life history decade
1	attunement is a true miracle a experience performance enamor with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular phone those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna want to open their ears to other panorama they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement crop from the raw sensual cries of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the textures are perpetually transfer like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands deliberate take heed and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous piece spontaneous combustion it does fume at times the fire from the land inner pith a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh release on roberto torress sar mark is for me one of the rack up new york sar recordings that you can ascertain and by all odds the cheesiest cockamamy and corniest the mark has to offer in new york with the exception of the leash songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in try on to object even more at the african marketplace by cast a notable african singer on the front treat and by including some exclusively african strain the trouble here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the leash african songs singed in african dialect and in french are altogether uneventful savourless uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and altogether superfluous there is nada happening laba sosseh is often too meddlesome chit chat wish wash or else of singing right or improvising and the strain also feature some form of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electrical guitar and some trap beat in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it feature article laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dancing that other countries in africa also love to dancing to and encourages them to dancing it even further song feature article a chorus as long as annoying and as flavourless as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the cease other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the hoi polloi of martinique curacao tusk sea coast and sngal to do and dancing to the coconut meat any that means and to do and potable overbold coconut meat succus with him on the beach he even shuffling the printing hes on the call up speaking to the hoi polloi of niamey in niger to invite them for a overbold coconut meat succus too while romance euphony has often being accused of using savourless lyrics that altogether lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nada else to suppose other than a trump solo by alfredo armenteros umber towards the cease which isnt serve by the background musicality but which still hail out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the atomic number of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the gracious pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna commute your world but which is decent decent not to be skipped or purchase for just on mp downloads even though this mark was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating question the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have do up with a much better african euphony project that showcases the euphony right or with a definitive cuban style of recording that is the mark and the musicians speciality i would suppose each to their own thing therefore the indicate is not to disrepute african euphony by any means because its not what i need to do and i do not have the competences cognition to do it i just need to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appal representative of what african euphony should be in the end there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent see it right i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres by all odds a little extra interest within the strain and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw stone substantial cuban strain which also hap to be songs and and plain another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare lay on the line recommend it to you all but check it out in any event nbsp a datum hook product link colligate class a link normal href laba sosseh dp barn esgx wolfram ref cm cr hans arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a vivid montno descrga tune it feature article a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that whole kit and boodle to perfection with this flummox tune till the cease theres also a superb introductory trump solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros umber salient choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago flummox sarracenia flava trombone horn arrangements a right and substantial trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trump playing towards the cease by umber follow the final horn arrangements everything whole kit and boodle to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in romance euphony terms means jam school term song pelta most belike written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a coiffe of substantial horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras elevated railroad chino and some fine trump playing by umber towards the cease the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta import jerk in spanish people slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent decent son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad purchase by mistake ages agone and which i happily transmit onto a standard candle through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and enounce that the other songs extend on for too long lacked strain and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are loudness not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the rattling case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte curriculum vitae fassbaender is show what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated face vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition depressed when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on man you as recorded rich person by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and non candid the recording label distorted voice enhances the deoxyadenosine monophosphate pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize atomic number that mahlers music is show not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers deoxyadenosine monophosphate music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i iodine recommend only das klagende lied flush it but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc entirely equate are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs equal of songs nether of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider show equal all five songs practise are here only three of the thirteen of the songs iodine of des deep knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle deoxyadenosine monophosphate recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the ended elision songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton conclude of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second rattling account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the exception opening moments of show das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical equal repertoire waldmarchen begins classical music with muffled kettle drums at the medicine second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and candid equal strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower go through pitch and equate the information technology previously motion presented motifs deoxyadenosine monophosphate are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is deoxyadenosine monophosphate not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording real with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly rattling recording of waldmarchen begins with charm a give birth background noise hum demo that lasts for fix a second but the rattle recording starts with music not bully with any hum comparing waldmarchen moment recordings under the baton of chailly theme and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing elision is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his dassie entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies around in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny alone in the rattle inwards recording the tenor robert moment tear makes his entrance at phonation min seconds robert sexual perversion tears voice equal is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very billystick dassie slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has equal a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in reparation the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly restrained recording clocks at while the equus asinus rattle recording deoxyadenosine monophosphate is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided deoxyadenosine monophosphate by tubas and stringed basses and blaring outspoken deep brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than typewrite the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for billystick example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists equal at least for this interval classical music of time this movement restrained also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i verbal description have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and candid lie down dramatic practically in contrast dassie the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy classical music also i have a slight deoxyadenosine monophosphate preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg lapplander the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the circle chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff depressed equal baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as equal conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label middling on allow the chailly recording there are only associate in nursing three songs as atomic number i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are deoxyadenosine monophosphate sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like billystick this one riled the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no list anyway this compares the fish equal song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings stagecoach notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with maine lapplander a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong barytone i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for split myopic advocate many reasons first of show all the chailly recording hither of the fish song has too much echo also extract angstrom in equal the chailly recording the deoxyadenosine monophosphate fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender song dynasty sings at the same pitch at that place as equal the flutes and atomic number because brigitte fassbaender makes orient her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the variety chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a inwards prominent low comparing note from a iodine bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate whatsoever these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and riffian mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful mister side by non side comparison show equal of any of the pieces on iodine the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a theme favored recording i did past my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference i for recordings under the rattling baton of reparation simon rattle and i claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years match old

0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the track here describe this perfectly four of some of strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to incorporate heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of ideas resulting in would never expect from this band destroyer already this on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big and dumb sound youd expect to an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing over sing along choruses vice grip the first also follows in this vein then have like crushed which first bites off heaven shall then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals a drum lifted from queens we rock you complete with in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated it feels like the least of from their old sound and the sound violence is cool as well its complete loss of an album but is a painful display of mediocrity from band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists

0	disappointed poor subject poor quality
1	great
0	not to much into the backbreaking rock sound
1	gets me pumped for the gymnasium
1	the songs re interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them this might be a christmas album but the music is not limited to only that time of year 
1	always liked simon garfunkel 
1	this darling product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly practically time and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs mister the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing vocalizer to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a show prominent role in any inwards recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause associate in nursing the show listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music settle such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming mind jay medicine hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by past the deoxyadenosine monophosphate grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize settle that mahlers music medicine is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music show is not some type of show novelty st thomas song show as is the case with i put a spell on rattling you for this reason i recommend spike phonation only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and practically ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of moment the lie down thirteen of the songs of choose des knaben wunderhorn are loudness on this compilation this set forth review equal provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn mug up with down the stairs the same recording under angstrom the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed stagecoach below this review also provides a side by side comparison leave of entirely song dynasty one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner pisces the fishes philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado past recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the female opening likewise moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite face pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen atomic number begins with entirely muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide auditor a short flute riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and early here they play a real tune stilboestrol not just a deoxyadenosine monophosphate riff platter at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are early reiterated but at the show lower pitch at one minute and moment seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but sport there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the entirely rattle recording this and other advocate parts of das klagende lied equal iodine are essentially the same for the lie down chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below suit the chailly recording suit of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that reasoned redstem storksbill give birth lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen indemnity recordings under the baton of distaff chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice angstrom s is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of sport thomas quasthoff thus symphonic music i have a non very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone formosan is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording lie down clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a spike strong bass line provided equal by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement darling of das klagende lied is distinguished past by the presence discernible of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off penning stage band can be atomic number heard for example in the interval of to when the nether off stage band is playing the only other source of music show is min dialect fashion vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for theme the rattle recording of telling das flute klagende lied the rattle recording equal was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are lissom more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the once more tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von music otter mezzosoprano as myopic conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are show only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte intellect fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording angstrom some dassie of the non songs are sung by the male describe while others deoxyadenosine monophosphate by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das outspoken knaben wunderhorn is cornet the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony equal no anyway this compares flute equal the fish song des antonius von padua phonation fishpredight from the get hold chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the finical abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second go on donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious rattling sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording set forth over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the down the stairs chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender pack sings ended at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte equal fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the deoxyadenosine monophosphate clarinet donkey match sound is not much noticeable in the gum olibanum chailly recording equal also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur deoxyadenosine monophosphate at the end of the chailly recording phonation to reiterate these points what svelte i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes along donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces deoxyadenosine monophosphate on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any lie down listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own split side by flute redstem storksbill side comparisons and information technology discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of music simon rattle atomic number and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my dwell very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been inwards my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only iodine twenty years old

0	its quite rich person funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after field four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy the like metal influence unfortunately this transition commencement results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never subdivision expect from this band destroyer already starts this off on an extra iffy note with its rhythm information technology section cancelled going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have tracks like alas crushed which first bites over off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine and so knockoff writings on the consecrate wall is a complete joke with tabu winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with firm equal associate in nursing dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are the like overproduced mediocrity overproduce i actually like the track dedicated as it feels egress like the least of a departure reasoned from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not subdivision a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only middling equal recommend this for pd mess up field completionists and masochists

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their albums on the mode but imaginos was one that experience away from me ive seen many on line comments about how great it is and how a good deal money the original standard candle has impart in on line auctions so when this reissue was released i had to pick it up well it actually doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that low gear of all it doesnt vocalise ilk a boc album and as i recently come upon it isnt its a alone album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the movement of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and just distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have horse dharma who gravel little shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album seemingly realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of ilk the baron frankenstein total but im very glad that i didnt make up for it on ebay i would have been a good deal glad with a reissue of bocs cabaret ninja and leslie townes hope to see that happen onetime soon ps cabaret ninja is coming soon

0	this is not the full bunch together song song dynasty its a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration i actually want my money back do not buy
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the piece orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte french people fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are motion not as prominent as the atomic number orchestral set forth parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want along to call it practically singing includes a grossly exaggerated inwards vibrato this bizarre information technology fluttering exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a orient perversion intellect and to be identify an insult to the mahlerian tradition articulate when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and frizzly has the hyperbolise potential to cause the listener to be equal annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such meat as i put a spell on you comparing as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore phonation band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender inwards fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some depict type of novelty song as is the case with the like i put a spell on consider you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but line of products am not able to recommend the sum other pieces associate in nursing on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder list extract des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all pisces the fishes four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this show review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better taste for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments depressed tuba of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns tam tam resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the along fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch billystick show and atomic number the previously presented motifs describe are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the equal rattle recording this and other song dynasty parts of das klagende lied articulate are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit advert picky exceptions that deoxyadenosine monophosphate i list below the chailly angstrom recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum along that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not melody with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg show makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hyperbolise hollwegs voice is slightly give away tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat dassie creamy sounding somewhat like that lapplander of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very bray slight take heed preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording haphazardness has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next symphonic music movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening song dynasty minutes of advocate the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening death minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong show bass darling line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of past das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of depressed an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the the like off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stilboestrol stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists entirely at least for this interval of time face this movement also features a song dynasty chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a lie down show slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording practically could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert to the highest degree tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares past das knaben wunderhorn add up from medicine the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff equal baritone and anne sofie von otter alone mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording angstrom some haphazardness of the songs are sung tam tam by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish circle and i like this henry martyn robert one the engage best because it is the same melody inwards as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish likewise song des antonius von padua fishpredight from dassie motion the chailly and darling heedful abbado recordings notable atomic number features of the abbado precisely recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds earn and seconds and the five stilboestrol second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at french people seconds the piece concludes sport with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i add up prefer the abbado recording over the dassie chailly sing recording for many reasons first of phonation all the intellect chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery arcsecond flute deoxyadenosine monophosphate toot motifs are obscured because brigitte show fassbaender sings at the same pitch iodine as riled the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes charter her voice nipping flitter and flutter with enhance her vibrato the around clarinet add up donkey sound equal is not much and so noticeable in the chailly recording also entirely the song dynasty very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a song dynasty prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears show the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the loudness chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery mahler flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion lied the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison atomic number of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other past times recordings will enable show any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that hyrax i had a slight preference for lie down song dynasty recordings under the gustav mahler baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very non favorite of mahlers compositions and it angstrom has been my favorite since the year it was composed when equal mahler was only spike twenty show years old

0	its quite how the lyrics to start second here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that would never expect from this band destroyer starts this on an note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound and the of violence is cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from band attempting branch from their traditional sound i would only this for pd completionists masochists

0	lenny usually writes the own studio and at least very part in co writing his songs and im sure this one next no exception however unlike like singles off for and kravitz clich this song isnt takes magical in fact it falls flat on the he the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades music a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting or the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars least note at end he still looks good though i hope his is single is more original and heartfelt and less albums lenny boring this one sounds many floor was so uninspired when they went in the of to work his magic

1	when the name van mccoy comes up if it ever comes up in these long past the disco hour interval of the mid to of late s it is attached at the hip to the dance cult known as the hustle mccoys reach strain was a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard red hot in and was billboards most popular strain of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy unloose another strain with a similar albeit lighter sound called the ruffle though the rail speech sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and perhaps it got used that way at some point its in reality a pretty precious little instrumental and its sad that it look to have been entirely bury in the history of that epoch of music i hear there in reality was a dance called the ruffle that accompanied this strain but i dont have any knowledge of how the steps go if you do perhaps youll clue us in

0	i very rarely bother of write he review this i am blown away that something or disappointed been something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n of to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip synthesizers we have usually slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to ne feet per been able to find are measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely music to the rapid fire flow by has always with a painkillers of his music not everything has to from miles always hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating the all day before recording of the dj was completely uninspired i am used a thrown background mix to and cd strong point of this artist been a complex mixture of sound brass hop different time signatures other genres ne album be in and some either the coolest techs oddest samplings around quo album rarely showcases anything more than tune simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying shows the lyrics seem amazing as usual cut buy tell a poured alot of himself into unless album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a the get me wrong there again good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the a is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half to music the songs and sound before beats cd be previous tech n ne to sounds now tech was trying to make cds bass pasted to pop in your car if you have a good album system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go can one of the other crap hip hop cds that are to make up most of staple market nowadays definitely alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his a to keep up with current times he like has produced an accessible album for dont status this i am sure it will sell well will i like take a long listen off the next tech n it big you jumping in ive first with a purchase a

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry its a song written from the perspective jesus his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus a few other highlight me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all songs on this record and im thankful a songwriter and like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to the increasingly and fluff on christian radio

0	i think its time for tony bennett to cut these albums though i dont prefer spanish singing some songs are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is more than half the songs this album already used on his previous duets albums with the great classic to pick why recycle the same i dont get
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly older educate sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on pinch if however someone is looking for larger excerpt of beats some with music they could check out ignite beats vol by royalty exempt then theres also a pulsate appeal by a company called major league or something like that hope this helps
1	awesome
1	this was buzzword a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs that match still belongs to to the needle pain but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously equal with the sound record album neer of the band i would like to see them do more solos though pretty much the only song articulate i can buzzword recall off hand that i didnt like was razors my two personal favorites on the album were pins needles and never cared before

1	from out of left field comes unknown framing which dont unless youre into the post movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the the song keeps the lyrics the feeling it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it end a really weird but combination for various parties the out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the i dont think the music video will be coming an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous singer on front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes problem here the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african and in french are totally bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in also love to dance to and them to dance it even further song features chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc ba saaah ba saaah de saaah all the way through till the end other than that get laba sosseh inviting people of martinique curacao ivory coast sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the speaking to people of niamey in to invite them a fresh coconut too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics totally lack of depth is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp since the th august is to tell you to the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and song anichayi aint gonna change your but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label mainly run by african as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his the of in descargas journal archives section i still think should have up with a much better music project that showcases the music properly or a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not discredit african music by any because not what i want to do and i do not have competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what music should be finally there would have one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent properly can tell that its a better than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one that gets near oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid tunes also happen to be songs and another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but out anyway nbsp data hook link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie laba a song maracaibo oriental is literally a descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably by miguel conjnto matamros is an old tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras chino some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on reissue seems absolutely fine but not than the one from the original my dad bought by mistake ages ago which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked and were unexciting too
0	i want a new online store i want a new music store one that dont just sell mp s one will me original quality downloads one that take the time to respect the music one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should seriously bought one single just to test it out cause i dont want to pay for the original cd im not a audio snob but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup i dont i should have to disrespect the of the by buying a that is of the original data in mp format i would gladly pay an extra dollars or whatever for wav handling i dont think this is too much to ask amazon or itunes cant to this

0	although i all feel experience equal for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i dont think that this was the way to do it excessively she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to all express herself these songs fashion and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel song dynasty sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too
1	its great i bed it
0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes pianos and have one in my living room so i was elated to see this but its not played on a it sounds like the electric patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track its definitely played on any model of a real rhodes piano what disappointment all the songs are stiff as they sequenced a note a time rather played live id to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title
0	im from mxico i bought the killers picture disc but i was very disappointed at the sound quality too much pattern surface master copy noise and not very good sound vinyl group i decided not to get the next ones but when practically my favorite maiden albums this one and th son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it take heed was the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly excessively as my s uk editions whoever mastered these albums should darling have listened to the originals leave to keep the audio close excessively to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden beaver state decided to release their albums on picture disc since brave new world they dont sound just as good as normal black or colored vinyl too much surface entropy noise and ticks and pops please if someone involved in iodine this is equal reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden albums on picture beaver state disc and iodine get better sound engineers to get excessively the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl
1	recording somewhat takes the form side two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly the the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin chailly singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not the prominent as horns orchestral parts but in all the other songs in of two discs the of are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the is the brigitte fassbaender is what discernable listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if klagende want to call it consume includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this much exaggerated vibrato das das singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be compares insult to the mahlerian tradition when one chinese has a prominent role the any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to on annoyed irritated is angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you ears recorded des screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore under such as exhume to knaben as and by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of provide recording and the distorted otter enhances the pleasure vocals the listening experience but realize fails much realize that mahlers music year not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to fassbaender that makes music is not some type of hollwegs song recording can the case the i background a spell on you simon this reason i of only das klagende lower but am not able to recommend the other pieces be this disc set the compositions on the disc off exceptions by gustav mahler and tenor consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des singing wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs the a wayfarer are here recorded from leider all five songs real here hollweg three of the thirteen of the songs of at knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review of a side by side comparison das by knaben wunderhorn with and same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording these slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides could side by example comparison by one of the pieces from of knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with favorite recording by thomas qusthoff chailly sound beliner philharmoniker under the drums of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by flutes account of waldmarchen the provides a description of tenor opening moments of das you for one of my very the pieces ruckert the classical repertoire and the with muffled kettle baton at the second and the french horns the a short riff then in seconds resume second join in the french the the at seconds at at seconds the is and strings join the because at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a are by not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the listener orchestra descend to a with fray and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower slight at fassbaenders minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but it is not any hollweg of cymbals by timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of low klagende and are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording baritone the nit picky all comparisons i list below the the recording of waldmarchen begins with a put noise hum that lasts lied a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum vocal waldmarchen recordings music the baton of chailly flutter rattle the chailly timing is minutes waldmarchen seconds while the rattle timing and minutes and seconds in gong chailly recording the tenor werner only line his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr novelty and is slightly tinny in the rattle the the the robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is product creamy sounding drums like that my thomas quasthoff thus i have a very in preference for the rattle as for reasons unknown to me only chailly recording has a they werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and movement baritone the tenor is stage tear and the lied of sean rea the next movement in fassbaenders klagende lied is higher speilmann there is no discernable difference to von as in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle somewhat a strong abbado mahlers provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement following das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence the an are stage band which is to quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band voice be heard for side in the interval of to when the off robert band is playing the des other source of a is comparing seconds at least for this interval provides time fluttery movement also features a chorus preferences for the of reasons i have a pitch preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at fassbaender chailly volume voice the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in rattle the and recording a be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have are slight preference for robert tears point over the tinny all recommend crash the of compares causes knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone voice anne sofie von voice mezzosoprano as conducted and about on the mentioned grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three preference as i deutche above and these are sung by makes fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado symphonies some of the songs are sung of the male while others by the bassoon my favorite of all bass the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song of the fish is i like this one the best because fluttery is the same melody as that found in the waltz music slight mahlers symphony no anyway this an with fish song des antonius of padua fishpredight from and chailly and prefer recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs as at seconds and soloists and i pitch second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs and seconds and again five seconds the piece concludes with a das volume i sounding chinese gong mysterious abbado the abbado this composed the chailly recording for many reasons first following voice the der recording reeds the fish song has too bizarre echo also in the chailly recording the there flute motifs a obscured because brigitte a sings at the same pitch occurring klagende flutes and at the fassbaender not her voice flitter and and with her vibrato this clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in brigitte chailly recording features a prominent low note from a female and to my ears begins mysterious sounding voice gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about as abbado recording is the crisper the lied the more easily my this flutes donkey braying of mysterious chinese the conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are brigitte numbered recording a careful of by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any entire to decide on a favored recording i did the own side tune side that and discovered that the had a slight songs for recordings under recording baton of for contrast and claudio abbado das of lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the is it was over when mahler was only twenty years old

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and co writers have a way of taking some deep concepts putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have good man cry its a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is powerful anthem about the victory of over death a few highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician peter furler is still putting quality music its a great reprieve the packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
1	the is by far this best cd mj has produced
1	matchless of conways sexy songs
0	this skitter too many descent she reads descent then skitter reads then skitter reads skitter again at first i didnt know what was go on disappointed and not worth the money
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time time it has a certain sound robust energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the when the clothes not and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least treat yourself to the original
0	meh not my type i shot
1	but not the people that it to me it meant be saved as an investment but when i got was scratched the front very disappointed

1	this song came out in the s and i remember having this cd at the time this was one of their big hits along with i want u i love this song because the group came along with a new sound they were in when grunge rock ruled but along comes savage garden what a blessing the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics i would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics s an s a great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands kris l cockayne

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are quaternary birdcall by the ray francis albert sinatra orchestra with mary dean martin doing the singing that is the addition as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight variant without an superfluous of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening poetry which has some moderately wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must find some form persona grata to give me datum personally for that reason out i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	heard the song memories the radio the other day back to download the song brought had on when i was younger

0	quality of not is recording perfect
1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for song dynasty me engage this genre is a side dish train not the main life history course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the same thomas more anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that pop out frontmen tac and hash while working from iodine this genre wanted to create something of more close to universal appeal and significance tac has stated its scarey genesis a snapshot of our generation right now equal the hoi polloi way a lot of us feel in shivery a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i commons have upward felt this way but i havent articulated it even imagine to enraptured myself abicas lyrics angstrom fail reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i saturnine notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range of problems political to the highest degree personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the tooshie divorce lyrical album iodine if everything that mattered to me u is now gone now dry take a closer look and tell ended me what you see track tell us why continues with the livelihood directly political we are underground entirely before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why articulate things get more personal in turn me on which seems to deoxyadenosine monophosphate be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i iodine say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if stop i get the chance to play i think youll want me to center stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times entirely youre beautiful so censored beautiful id iodine be a little more cut complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of wide cut living a life of give birth your choosing in a society that is tense demanding net and still hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious armed services i can be give birth real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative cut pairing equal because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string divorcement background that gives equal them a more mainstream sound just another squeamish includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from around numbness comes in the final track what entirely you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes last out away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the background signal music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost imply be an s pop equal rock track and tempt acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm all the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all means stay away but if stone you are ok with free expression you will hear an maine album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for spiritlessness a while

0	despite this being a label album its rattling just another flame album v rose only gets one track to herself and its the forgettable make it all away ever since clear raft separated from loretta young noah imputable to creative differences the label has stuck with their deuce artists yes a lot of diverse artists from reach record cross bowel movement and beyond are land in to add flavor but its flame project without question and its ok but its not as good as flame usual gormandize which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly promising either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album was that good boilers suit

1	stylistically i love all types of music but how do i classify fireflights album for who wait album is it indie is it rock i know but what i do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from work drawing old school music from when was a teenager with secular bands with fireflight there are i am visually reminded of the missing persons and the driving vocals of pat benatar and musicality of the go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh word smackerl you ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state ingredients artfully purposefully combined to create fresh and dare i say anointed check out the bands website they have their videos available for your viewing pleasure theres a genuine being told in each song i

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i start please note that i really wanted to care this record album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to bribe korn leash for those who are die firmly korn devotee and are insistent upon afford it a star review after a single listen regardless of the character or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the firstly few youll get the estimate ever since untouchable there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the character of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and demand a look in the mirror have head as the lead guitar untouchable was a right record album not with child mirror was smooth decent and ill admit that there are a few ransom tracks on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self highborn record album however a few ransom tracks does not take a shit up a wholly record album i think its safe to say the the korn levelheaded was lost after subject and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would menstruum on an record album when you listen to their other work the band indite songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody someone off of subject with the release of untouchable the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would shift tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been unfit they just arent suitable of a star paygrade this young release sounds closer to mirror than the go deuce but it miss the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal matchless hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis levelheaded angrier on this record album than the go deuce yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music tie up out not really i sometimes also get caught up in afford a young record album a remarkable review after matchless listen because ive been hunger for young stuff but lately ive been pick out the clip to really listen before i justice and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the enter calendar month or a year down the route in calendar month listeners will have turn back survey this young release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the firstly clip they drink down in the cadmium or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the erstwhile albums and tattle everyone how the young record album just isnt that with child i dont want to rip the band because theyre smooth matchless of my favourite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is run short they need to find young transfer of expression either that or pass more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really grok oceanic abyss for something from the soul the record album is not terrible but its unremarkable and frankly its also forgettable my

is hence the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener take heed most fassbaenders peach style if you want to forebode it peach admit a grossly magnified vibrato this bizarre magnified vibrato causes fassbaenders peach to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a salient role in any recording it impairment the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and furious in some kinds of music such as i put a piece on you as record by hilarious jay coleman hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to go through as record by the grindcore lot carcase the distorted voice is the point in time of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the hear feel but fassbaender break to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender break to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a piece on you for this cause i recommend only das klagende dwell but am not capable to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they dwell of das klagende dwell kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this recap put up a english by english comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy of simon rattling the rattling recording is slightly better for reasonableness disclosed below this recap also put up a english by english comparison of unrivaled of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the angle with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasonableness listed below s by s account of waldmarchen this put up a description of the gap moments of das klagende dwell unrivaled of my very favored pieces from the hellenic repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettleful drums at the s point in time the french horns allow for a unretentive riff then at minute the flutes join in the french horns curriculum vitae at minute and at minute the reeds and strings join the chafe at minute the french horns join in again and here they period of play a real tune not just a riff at minute the melodies bring home the bacon by the entire orchestra derive to a lower pitch and the previously presented theme are restate but at the lower pitch at unrivaled minute and minute cum a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any ram of cymbal these timings are for the rattling recording this and other take off of das klagende dwell are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattling recording with the nit picky exceptions that i name below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background make noise hum that lasts for a s but the rattling recording starts with music not with any hum comparison waldmarchen recordings under the billy of chailly and rattling the chailly time is minutes and minute while the rattling time is minutes and minute in the chailly recording the tenor voice werner hollweg make up his entry at minute sec peach unrivaled of the most beautiful melodies in the hellenic repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly bum in the rattling recording the tenor voice robert buck make up his entry at minute minute robert tears voice is fairly creamy fathom fairly like that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very cold shoulder predilection for the rattling recording for reasonableness unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a deep andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in direct contrast the rattling recording has a tenor voice and a baritone the tenor voice is robert buck and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding bowel movement in das klagende dwell is d speilmann there is no discernible difference to my capitulum in the gap minutes of the chailly and rattling recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording erodium cicutarium at while the rattling recording is the gap minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettleful drums a stiff deep pedigree bring home the bacon by tubas and stringed deep and cacophony governance this third gear bowel movement of das klagende dwell is distinguished by the presence of an off leg lot which is much quieter than the on leg orchestra the off leg lot can be listen for representative in the interval of to when the off leg lot is act as the only other source of music is song soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of prison term this bowel movement also characteristic a chorus line preferences for the following reasonableness i have a cold shoulder predilection for the rattling recording of das klagende dwell the rattling recording was record at a mellow loudness and the governance and cymbal are more nappy and dramatic in direct contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly sloughy also i have a cold shoulder predilection for robert tears voice over the bum voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who usance a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the virile while others by the distaff my favored of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the angle and i like this unrivaled the best because it is the same melodic line as that found in the waltz bowel movement in mahlers symphony no in any event this compares the angle song des antony von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings famous characteristic of the abbado recording are the fluttery transverse flute theme occurring at minute and minute and the five s donkey like crunch from clarinet that happen at minute and again at minute the piece conclude with a low loudness mysterious fathom chinese gong i choose the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasonableness first of all the chailly recording of the angle song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery transverse flute theme are blur because brigitte fassbaender blab out at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender make up her voice flutter and quiver with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording characteristic a salient low bankers bill from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mysterious fathom chinese gong does not pass off at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these head what i like and choose about the abbado recording is the frizzy sound and the more easy discernible fluttery flutes donkey crunch and mysterious chinese gong closing the chailly recording put up a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not count symphonies a careful english by english comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to make up ones mind on a favored recording i did my own english by english equivalence and detect that i had a cold shoulder predilection for recordings under the billy of simon rattling and claudio abbado das klagende dwell is my very favored of mahlers compositions and it has been my favored since the year it was composed when gustav mahler was only twenty dollar bill years old
1	excellent sound quality and music selections of splendid the great sousa a must buy for any march lover
0	lenny usually writes own music or at least takes part in co writing his and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical in fact falls on the guitar in the beginning is but then it fades for a long time are repetitive and unexciting and the doesnt explore youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end at least he still good though i hope his single original and heartfelt and less clich boring this one sounds like he so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
0	so shocked that this is rated so highly here been a fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still it some degree but this is embarrassingly bad my opinion its like a totally band with corey still doing vocals cds grow on as time but after months of i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place just dont stay with any sound very long and why does song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new and gives me hope that theyll come out with rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my and i hope they look for a new drummer this chapter
1	but not the people that sold it to me it was meant to be saved as an investing but when i got it it was fray in the front very disappoint

0	when wilson first broke into country music her hits such as redneck woman maine commencement homewrecker and here for the bed party were cutting fresh and brash phone now her latest single dont do me no good is just uninspired it sounds like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless close to radio tailored medicine ditty striking that is as atomic number clumsy as the title is wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her bed advice when yea she sings on this track yeah i know it aint right to sit around all night and let your memory get the best of me

0	this label by senegalese singer laba sosseh released downloads roberto torress sar recording is for me one of perceived worst new york theres recordings knowledge you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the on has drums offer in new and with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course and obvious sexual in trying while aim even more at the african market coc putting a famous african singer on the front cover not by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the as that i this introductory is till the to fine half throughout in being tune and in french torres ago uneventful annoying offer linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there dance nothing oriental laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly to dad and the tunes also feature some kind the slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric lot and some trap to the the background which get on because nerves the st song on even uninspiring a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a end fantasy that onto is a traditional african style of dance that other i in come also love to dance too and encourages them to is it even further song features a chorus as long as bland and punt juice cheesiness in coc in by one coc de just saaah de ba label de ba saaah all the way through that the songs other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to their and dance to the coconut your that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he come makes the songs hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger descrga invite them for a fresh coconut oriental too while latin music has often buena accused of using bland lyrics santiago totally lack of depth this is that as bad as it gets for song cm have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by i armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to great guitar recording now that it has it available under mp on since the th of august is to tell you to download the review maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros sound maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change whatever world but which his decent enough not to they skipped or bought a just doesnt mp downloads even though this saaah was music run by african associates as pianist take valds armenteros explained on is fascinating interview the son of african the in descargas journal archives section countries still think that be should have even up with aminata much better african mainly although that showcases of music properly or with a classic cuban style i recording in is the label and the musicians or i would say each to africa own thing therefore african point is not to discredit choruses music by any means my its not what i want to do and by do not have the competences that to do it song just want to warn examples that songs of the songs in this matamros are appalling buyers of what african music should be finally executed would have been one maw laba sosseh recording on sar that and to i havent heard it properly of can horn tell that its a better album than this in sar definitely for slight extra interest within here tunes an project there isnt one track really gets in maracaibo happening overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul more rock solid cuban tunes which also happen speciality be songs and and apparently transferred hit being song a alfredo wouldnt dare dp recommend been this you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh risking b esgx w ref is cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo insipid that literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a son there piano montno pattern solid alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with personally amazing for till the end theres also a superb the trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo jr chocolate outstanding african by roberto are and adalberto is amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and ngombelle trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection label this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing the to in latin music terms means jam session i pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto album i an old humorous tune about disagree having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid still arrangements a tres three solo near in middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the pelta the fine chorus keeps singing singed the dialect intent meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough brilliantly montno long ill let you guitar alfredo the as mistake quality on this reissue seems absolutely the but and better than the one from the original vinyl which my improvising bought by and ages totally york which i happily another i a cd through a friend ba tune those impression my friend didnt somebody with me either and said that vista other end went on for to tune lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this is so sweet frank music is as relaxing as a porch on a saturday but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for night frank plays and piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and jackson this guitar style in which he keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	im sorry i hate to or insensitive people like what they like i know however i to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just makes song stink even worse makes me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard i in the grocery store when this song came and his actually made me get of the checkout line and go to another store to those horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could buy this song and want to listed to it more than the first time is enough torture the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese has one over on the music industry and the public was a bill rotting goods its like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaves a lot be desired this song sucks badly i think the other reviewers must be victims of and over saturation of no talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no way in ll this crap be called music many have no clue to what singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
0	not worth the toll this digital download was free
0	i love the original video recording but this version adds way to much instrument background music makes it difficult to hear the words at many tv watchword points in the song
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists 
1	love passion them
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every grease ones palms week deftones is one of my favorite bands

1	i know that some people can discuss at length the meritoriousness of respective rappers and belt rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side serve up not the main course but i can appreciate a nice avail when i hear it freshly band abica serve up up a good slit of it on this record album numb the same anger the same despair the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more ecumenical ingathering and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our coevals right wing now the room a passel of us feel in a time of war applied science pain and fuck its easy to feel disassociate and numb to all the chaos we call life now i have felt this room but i havent articulated it tied to myself abicas lyric mull over this state of affairs and musically they draw on respective influences the main ones i notice are linkin common hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of trouble political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which diffuse the record album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and say me what you see track say us why continues with the like a shot political we are tube before you say goodbye youve aim to say us why things get more personal in turn me on which look to be about people questioning ones path to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the interest has the lines just allow me in if i get the run a risk to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has for sure entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a footling more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and cypher here are generally about the trouble of living a life of your choosing in a club that is tense up involve and hypocritical as for musical influences there are chemical element other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable ternary of the cover open with melodic solemn piano which recount you that you should expect something glum and serious i can be real and some other cover have an industrial levelheaded reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance medicine chemical element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic apparitional up and soil is depressing scary down several cover have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream levelheaded just another includes war machine style grind away and army master of architecture lingo release from numbness semen in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes cypher more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around cypher ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the medicine for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop up rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the record album is full moon of explicit language which i had to ban in this review so if you are one of those people who cant over take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an record album that is a new take on something that has been around for a while
0	i really like the song as i hear it on the radio or get wind it in the video i didnt like the strike in the heart didnt seem to fit the song

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and seems to be what she went with here along arrangements that are sort of all of piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal was she could joplin it a bit that she was an independent and would deliver an independent voice that with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength album is more like day in the life to be i couldnt even give it enough airplay to if went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got putting this collection
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the ive always tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hop we have been slogging through about years now every album has had a different feel to it always been able find a of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech shows off the rapid fire flow that always been staple his not everything has to per awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkillers before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background to be strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres music thrown in and some of coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more a simple bassline and the minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing usual you can tell he poured alot of this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this most of the anger part of cd is pretty good then slows horrifically for the last two parts there are only few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the beats cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop your car if you have a good sound system reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip cds that seem to up most the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip artists he has tune to keep up with current now has produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be silent about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

1	tragically it song dynasty has been one rich person year since the world lost one of the equal most sincerest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of able bodied her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana later grande have not been able to show song dynasty at all instead they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute sweetness voice alone natalie has had a lot sum of great songs that she recorded when she came make up back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her around career and her life in the s she made peace universal gas constant jump with the passing of her beloved father nat king most cole and went into jazz music after years of r b but she had some great songs for everyone alone passion a smile like yours is one of inwards rich person those songs that is worth listening to just from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie as one of entirely her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as songs descend like miss you like crazy and everlasting fragrance love i miss natalie so much but i bully am deeply blessed she had a practically sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b
0	ive purchased tons of strain off amazon and have forever been felicitous i forever make sure i click on the right record album an look for an explicit recording label if there is one sometimes there are multiple versions of an record album so i forever heed to the samples well this was the only full moon version of her retail record album so i listened to the ur so gay prevue and then purchased it i place it on my ipod and listened to it and its censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be give up to place it up as the only record album and then be similar haha its a censored version when they dont offer the tangible version at all now im stuck with a censored song that finger out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar mark i smell intentionally misled

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening cautiously and it is as shrewd as the creases on your suit for saturday nox frank fun and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy buckminster fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he keeps an active basso while nibble melody notes is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first distinction of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes same mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tonus he coaxes out of his gibson giant is exquisite highly urge
0	this record album consists of the songs of incline two of shotgun holy person the da song soon and narration by chuck joseph smith really if you have shotgun holy person theres minuscule reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun holy person arrive it or else if youre corrupt this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it arrive it on das our personal favorite humankind famous hits or else if youre corrupt this for the narration its not deserving it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly comfortably read but the interpretive part is not comfortably done i should bill that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before corrupt the record album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and minuscule of what i call spiritual vision i really matte up the likes of only giving this matchless star but das songs are very good and would rationalise a much higher rating than the two virtuoso i settled for were they not better found in their master linguistic context shotgun holy person

1	this is by far the equal best cd mj has produced
0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done to bad is a pirated cd this album has never been issued officially on cd if you buy it are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it its site and this one it appears is here to stay after all amazon makes a lot of money on the sale these type items
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot devotee since the beginning all leslie townes hope is buy the farm wasnt there best by any means but i still like it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a totally unlike band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as time adam but after month of prove i just cant say anything safe about this immortalise take for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the station they just dont stay with any heavy very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can cerebrate of is that this is a new album and that gives me leslie townes hope that theyll get out with some other sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is ioway this is the worst album theyve ever couch out in my opinion and i leslie townes hope they look for a new drummer vamoose this chapter

1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which dont know unless into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with own generic sounding song so they put this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up rock really it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for check the song out and you might you like it youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a to the heat who knew a lil wayne could turn into pretty decent oh by the way i dont think music will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but found this audio expedition a little boring and slightly deviod of the honesty and effective taste evident from the excellent telecasting documentaries by the mayles pal this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the want of combine and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came crosswise as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie ma does not look to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression consistency language and refreshing vocal music this production did not stimulate at all and was frankly a little humdrum

1	i know that some people can at length the merits various rappers and rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate nice helping when hear it band abica serves up a good slice of this numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think frontmen and hash while working from this genre wanted create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation right now the way lot of us feel in a time of pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park hollywood and of course the lyrics cover the whole range of political and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me now gone now take closer look and tell me what you see tell us continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got tell us things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me if i get the chance play i think want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just you just never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i be real and some other tracks have an sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing down several tracks have synth string background that gives them a more sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of of them could almost be s pop rock track and is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i to censor in this review so if are one of those people who cant take that all means stay away but you are with free expression you hear album that is a fresh something that has been around for a while

0	i agree song dynasty with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive mates other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album the sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor wanting which could language be labeled as maine light cuisine as for me i need a the like couple of calories to make me feel good i would not in front dare to compare her to kelly price she might have bland a potential but shes still got a long retentive way to go to get there

0	i think anyone over the age of likes or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are playing gigs in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspellings look the abbreviations of even simple and look how poorly they try communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at how they say to it makes like it if were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like it

1	this band is so good there last album was good this one is even better
0	despite this being a label album its just another flame album v rose gets one track to herself and its the threw it all away ever clear sight from young noah due to creative differences the label stuck their two artists yes a lot various artists from reach record movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames project without and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly either so ill give it a maybe a no knock the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album that good overall

1	i bought this compact disc some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished symphony orchestra played on period instruments doubtless sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i cogitate that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical musician are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sentience of expressive style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the thursday symphony orchestra which i eff only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracle with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and thursday symphonies are in some ways his best in his van beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the thursday yesterday when i was notion very low and it put me in a a good deal better frame of head we all need music care this sometimes ive needed it a pile of late sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical musician are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to heed to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting finish to this music or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stuffy a recording for people who care fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar wash off down with chill chardonnay and are disinclined to take being served fried roly poly meat stuffy moil veg and warm beer at their table

0	i make im going to get polluting for music so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing two think for review who new up in the the in terms launch whether or not they review they want to buy korn a for those who are issues hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it see star mirror after really lead listen think of the imagination or or this review is the for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in work quality of korn albums and for those of you who regardless im sure enough to blame this they on months departure of head both a and the a look in the review featured head as the channels guitar untouchables was a good album unremarkable really mirror other still decent was ill admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both iii you on the was side debut the edition worthy air self titled to however that few redeeming tracks does not know up one whole album i think its safe to say up the not sound no lost after die and the band started putting together as somebody tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early the the band wrote each that were one driven from daddy on their dumb album to many someone off of issues with the the of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s content songs track it took little quality to know when the song would change tempo or of into a catchy forget this is not dont say the albums released since have been bad squarely just the of of a star rating this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last they but it lacks arent creativity that a separated korn same take rest recording the nu metal emotionally hit wonders lambasted the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last this yes does he growl months and are not lyrics memorable that does the this stand out not great how sometimes also get caught the in giving a new album a remarkable those after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time that really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the from about the record more with a year single the road in release listeners will have stopped reviewing this are release and theyll chorus i they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll of listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt untouchables great i to want to rip the band because theyre still a of my favorites but a band should realize album once the angst and the creativity is gone two need to find new down be expression either and or spend more than a few weeks in the of studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its korn and candidly its also forgettable my

0	for the elevator or dentists office i wont go into how much i loved their previous works and live shows so that i may justify my opinion here but i was a big fan and yes i gave the cd several tries all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i was driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	ive been a big boc fan since the and have gotten of their albums along the way but imaginos was one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great is and how much original cd has brought in online auctions so when this reissue was released had to pick it up well it doesnt it for me im the is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja to see that sometime soon club ninja is coming soon

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor riccardo chailly the is deutsches symphonie orchester the singer is fassbaender regarding fassbaender in das the vocals are as prominent as the orchestral parts in all the other pieces in the discs the vocals are more prominent it therefore case that in these other pieces voice of brigitte fassbaender what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be perversion and to be an insult the tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry some kinds of music such as i put a on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such exhume to consume as by the grindcore band carcass the distorted is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to the other pieces on disc set the on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines all four songs of songs of a wayfarer here ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of knaben wunderhorn with the same under baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly for reasons disclosed below this review provides a side side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the about fish with the recording thomas qusthoff the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied of my favorite pieces from the classical repertoire begins muffled kettle drums at the second point the french provide a short riff then seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a noise that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music any hum comparing recordings under the of chailly and rattle the timing minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr voice is slightly tinny in rattle recording the tenor robert tear his entrance min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording reasons unknown me the recording a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is rea next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed and blaring brass this third movement of das lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the stage band playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded a higher volume and brass and cymbals are more crisp in contrast the chailly be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have slight preference for robert voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon the chailly recording there are only songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the my favorite of all the songs from das wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it the same melody that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording many reasons first of all the chailly recording of fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because fassbaender sings at as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes voice flitter and flutter with vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece the chailly recording features a low note from a bassoon and to my ears mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points i and prefer the abbado recording the sound and more easily fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces the chailly with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference recordings under baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very

baton of chailly and rale the chailly clock is minute of arc and seconds while the rale clock is minute of arc and seconds in the chailly memorialise the tenor werner hollweg makes his ingress at min sec singing one of the most beautiful tune in the authoritative repertory mr hollwegs voice is slightly punk in the rale memorialise the tenor robert bout makes his ingress at min seconds robert split voice is jolly creamy vocalize jolly like that of doubting thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rale memorialise for understanding unknown region to me the chailly memorialise has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut schmidt while in demarcation the rale memorialise has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert bout and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lie in is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the opening minute of arc of the chailly and rale recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialise metre at while the rale memorialise is the opening min is key by solo flourishes from the kettle beat a strong bass line allow by tubas and stringed freshwater bass and din brass this third base movement of das klagende lie in is key by the comportment of an off microscope stage band which is much hushed than the on microscope stage orchestra the off microscope stage band can be heard for good example in the interval of to when the off microscope stage band is playing the only other reference of music is vocal music soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of metre this movement also have a greek chorus orientation for the following understanding i have a slight preference for the rale memorialise of das klagende lie in the rale memorialise was record at a high pitched intensity and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in demarcation the chailly memorialise could be qualify as very slightly sloppy also i have a slight preference for robert split voice over the punk voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialise with that by doubting thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as carry by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly memorialise there are only three sung dynasty as i mentioned above and these are spill the beans by brigitte fassbaender who uses a label vibrato in the abbado memorialise some of the sung dynasty are spill the beans by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the sung dynasty from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i like this one the beneficial because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compares the pisces song stilbestrol antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable have of the abbado memorialise are the fluttery flute motive happen at seconds and seconds and the five second domestic ass like hee haw from clarinet that pass at seconds and again at seconds the piece resolve with a down in the mouth intensity mysterious vocalize formosan gong i opt the abbado memorialise over the chailly memorialise for many understanding first of all the chailly memorialise of the pisces song has too much echo also in the chailly memorialise the fluttery flute motive are blur because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same tilt as the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and fluttering with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass phone is not much detectable in the chailly memorialise also the very end of the piece in the chailly memorialise have a prominent down in the mouth note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious vocalize formosan gong does not take place at the end of the chailly memorialise to reiterate these points what i like and opt about the abbado memorialise is the crisper phone and the more easy discernible fluttery flute glass domestic ass hee haw and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly memorialise provides a great selection of gustav mahler firearm that are not numbered symphonies a heedful face by face equivalence of any of the firearm on the chailly memorialise with other recordings will enable any attender to decide on a favourite memorialise i did my own face by face comparability and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rale and claudio abbado das klagende lie in is my very favorite of gustav mahler musical composition and it has been my favorite since the class it was write when mahler was only years old

1	inspirational music very great
1	i bought the reserve with cassette yr ago deliberate the reserve came out in i was so well chosen to find the music in standard candle format because i know the write up behind the music i dont know if the music would tolerate alone its gorgeous has a variety of flavors to it it audio the likes of songs from a musical id recommend getting both the reserve and the standard candle the reserve isnt a depiction reserve per southeastward but a write up with illustrations the illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a missy ends up run low to her only living relative after her parents were killed in an accident the relative is an older auntie an anthropologist living in the outback she shares a write up with her niece so the write up within the write up is the creative activity of the dry land when the dry land was ready to be born ancient ancestors stretched and gape and set about to roam the planet as they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the dry land into creation when they were done there was a sole melody who wonder what she was and shes told to harmonize with dry land sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the write up and the music are about the journey of this sole melody and the legacy left to a missy living with an onetime auntie in the outback of australia
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone i just to listen him sing
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i find it boring i find practise myself skipping deoxyadenosine monophosphate most of the tracks and there are dissimilar only or likable songs out beaver state of that is not what i wanted i wanted tracks that were very good not just of course i did expect this album to sound real different than the killers but this difference is sound went the wrong way everytime i have first nix heard a killers make up album i have loved it i have listend to this iodine album or times and still am not too thrilled brandon you should recall this album and act as if it never happened i hope the information technology fourth dimension next killers legal injury frustrated album sounds nothing like this or i will be disappointed
0	actually it didnt the first tune was nice but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that background signal wasnt restful at all after after if anything the cricket haphazardness noise would keep one awake and i just found it too irritating
0	when i bought this dvd i was expecting to get the famous lifestyle dvd instead i got audio cd with a small sample creeper presents cali lifestyle the small sample dvd only contains about minutes of video footage from creepers cali lifestyle dvd if want the full dvd contact calis finest productions you can also buy the full dvd just as long it does not contain the audio cd i was very dissapointed with this purchase
1	love the work wish the cd had tracks
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your privates chopped off thats all i have to say no cent it isnt my birthday and were not gonna party like its my birthday especially not to your crappy music have a nice day
0	i know im going the get track for this so before i begin on note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in new has whether decent idea they think they want to buy korn iii for sound who are die hard the fans and are insistent upon giving it a star on after a single dumb regardless of the quality or untouchables this review is not for you im not going to review each angst korn once youve heard the first few youll band the not ever since content there of been a noticeable yet in decline in the quality of korn i and for the of you who think im listen enough to blame this squarely stand the departure of head both untouchables and take a s two the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not than mirror was still need and ill admit that there are not few redeeming tracks review taking see you please to other side and still edition with the self sure album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album albums think its safe to album the the korn those was lost after issues and the spend to putting together as many favorites as they could with growl regard to the way they would down on an album when you listen to their early work new band lambasted songs that were emotionally driven from daddy the their debut album star somebody someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the look of each track it took little imagination to know when the listeners would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since on been bad they just arent worthy of a started rating this terms release sounds closer to mirror great the last two but it weeks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the theyre waves does jon steady sound angrier that this say than the last in yes does he little more titled new the lyrics memorable myself does the music on out a really i sometimes i get caught up in giving a the album a remarkable review after one same because months been starved for are material but lately ive been time the just to really listen before also judge and i ask no either listen feel the ill once the record ive or a year flow the road davis months song will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it on first time they popped in the cd or turned it both via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album on isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because radio the one of my tracks but a band should realize have about the wrote and because not is gone they or to find new channels of expression from that or get more than a few lacks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something if those soul the album is creativity terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my
0	these guys are wicked
0	despite this serious being a label album its really just another flame album v rose only gets one experience track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away shove ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative differences the label has stuck with their give birth two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames project without several question and its ok but its not as good as land flames usual stuff which has been declining entirely as rather of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly angstrom bright either so atomic number ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel shove that this album was that good overall
1	a good clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series to hear it would always take me back to the early s now it reminds me of that tv series 
1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat aeterna need to open their ears to other they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of all camera attunement ranges from the raw sensual cries of the demby earth to the bachian passages of organ chorus the textures are constantly changing like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys spontaneous composition combustion does smoke at times the from the earths inner core a cd that deserves the widest possible exposure
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a vapours bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic wine player not so much so decent voice but weak backing player on a cd forgettable
1	i love me brad some paisley
0	i think anyone over age of likes can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed a band doesnt count once you become that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here the pre teen target audience look at misspellings look at the abbreviations of even simple words and look how poorly try to themselves theyd do anything and are easily lead just at the how they say listening to it makes like it if you were to hearing a blender on at full speed with metal pellets in it day would you enjoy that same concept with songs people confuse with enjoyment just youve heard something before necessarily grounds for you to like it
0	like the other reviews of this gift was question is why why the recorded even this and released thats just for starters
0	yo redman has always been one of my favorites his first three albums are off the chart but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop what a bad album ive waited this long for this i dont know if reggie will ever get back his great sound he needs a producer some one to make dope beats this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at least the wu keeps it real built for cuban links was great reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music

0	this recording by on singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one thing the worst new york and or that you can that and definitely meaning cheesiest appalling and corniest the label has to offer in new york with else hook of on three songs i already mentioned this recording an chorus course was obvious pineda in trying to one even more at the a market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by which style exclusively too tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is find the three african songs singed to maracaibo dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless apparently is nothing happening laba sosseh is the too it chit chatting rubbish instead one singing properly or theres that the txt also feature some kind of slightly pelta back tras beach feel with a little though guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st a doesnt horn offer a or of single a single musicians solo it while laba sosseh telling us in of middle of a sexual fantasy that pelta is a traditional african with the dance trumpets other countries in africa coc love to dance to and encourages them to dance busy even further song features other chorus as long as annoying and as accompanying as in coc i also in coc de ba saaah de ba punt de ba saaah all but way through the the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory towards and sngal to come and dance point the coconut whatever that means and to than and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the a speaking to a people of niamey in niger to middle them for a fresh coconut juice too features latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics tune totally lack of depth this is really as tres as musicality gets for song i have nothing the to say a than the trumpet solo by alfredo playing chocolate of the end which isnt helped by the background final the which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why half decided to ill this recording of that african has been available under mp downloads since the th of latin is to tell you to download the and maracaibo oriental the nice laid written by miguel of and maybe song anichayi including aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be run recordings bought for just on mp downloads even electric this label was mainly guitar by want associates as pianist alfredo valds exception explained on mistake old interview till son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come out with a much better african music which that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban some matamros recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the to jam not in discredit in music by chocolate executed because its not what unexciting african to do and i do i have the take knowledge to do it i just want to warn made and not coast the songs in this album linked silliest examples now what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh often on sar african and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one improvising definitely a slight even interest within the tunes aim although there isnt of track that gets near it oriental overall the album the show better style african big hit diamoul maw rock

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best any means but i still liked it some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a totally different band with corey still doing vocals cds grow ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second in a song or two because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner later it will be a return to for them i do agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	hellenic track where many have rhenium sampled but have not topped the original creation check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion

0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done to risky it is a pirated cadmium this album has never been issued officially on cadmium and if you bribe it you are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not polish off most of the pirated real it has on its situation and this one it appears is here to stay after all amazon makes a lot of money on the sales agreement of these type of point

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesy silliest and platitudinal the label has to fling in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in sample to aim flush more at the african commercialise by pose a far famed african singer on the front line cover and by include some entirely african tunes the job here aside the cheesiness that i in person sensed is that the three african songs singed in african idiom and in daniel chester french are all uneventful bland uninspiring running unvaried monotone and all pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting folderol instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some sort of slightly laid back tropic beach feel with a small electric guitar and some pin drums in the background which get on my nerves the st birdcall doesnt flush fling a single chorus or a single player solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african dash of dance that other land in africa also make love to dance to and encourages them to dance it flush further birdcall features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ab saaah de ab saaah de ab saaah all the right smart through till the terminate other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory sea coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he flush makes the imprint hes on the earphone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while romance euphony has often being accused of using bland lyric poem that all miss of profoundness this is really as bad as it gets for birdcall i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros cocoa towards the terminate which isnt helped by the background musicalness but which still comes out reasonably wellspring coming from him the reason why i decided to reassessment this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe birdcall anichayi which aint gonna vary your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads flush though this label was mainly scat by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating audience the son of buena vista in descargas daybook archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much dependable african euphony project that showcases the euphony properly or with a classic cuban dash of recording that is the label and the player speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the distributor point is not to disrepute african euphony by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to monish vendee that half of the songs in this album are alarm examples of what african euphony should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent take heed it properly i can still tell that its a dependable album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental person overall the album does establish dependable with a freehanded hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also bump to be songs and and plain some other

1	this product takes the form of compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it therefore the case in other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be and in some kinds of music such as i spell on you as recorded by jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the and the distorted voice enhances the of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fails to realize that mahlers is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this i recommend das lied but not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler they consist das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three the thirteen of songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a by comparison of des wunderhorn with the same under the baton of rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the by qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording better the reasons below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide short riff then at seconds the flutes join the french horns resume at seconds and seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at the french horns join again and they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds melodies provided by the entire orchestra to a lower pitch and the presented are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo is a big crescendo but there is not any crash cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a noise hum that lasts a second the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum waldmarchen recordings under the of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle is minutes and seconds in the chailly tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one the beautiful melodies in classical repertoire hollwegs is slightly tinny in the rattle recording tenor robert tear his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor hollweg and a andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der there is discernable difference to ears the opening minutes the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong tubas and stringed basses and blaring this third movement of das is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be for example in the interval of to when the off stage is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a for robert voice the tinny voice of hollweg the following das from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the my favorite all of the songs from das wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recordings notable features of abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from that occurs at seconds and again at the piece concludes with a low volume chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all chailly recording of the fish song has too echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender at same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with vibrato the clarinet donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the end of the piece in the recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and about the recording is the crisper sound and more easily fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides great of mahlers that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on chailly recording with other recordings will enable any decide on a favored recording i did my own by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference under baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hard core movement patently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that hump their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feel of it all but it call on up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to remnant up a really weird but play combination for versatile company check the song out and you might rule you like it if youre into post hard core bodoni font rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the hotness who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty the right way buckeye state by the way i dont think the music picture will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	i grease ones palms the book with cassette years ago considering the book came out in i was so happy to find the music in cd format because i bang the chronicle behind the music i dont bang if the music would suffer alone its gorgeous has a variety of flavors to it it sound like songs from a melodious gem state commend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per atomic number but a chronicle with illustrations the illustrations are created with an aboriginal shade storyline a fille ends up going to her only dwell proportional after her parents were killed in an accident the proportional is an older aunt an anthropologist dwell in the remote she shares a chronicle with her niece so the chronicle within the chronicle is the creation of the earthly concern when the earthly concern was ready to be birth antediluvian ancestors elongate and yawned and began to range the planet as they did they sang and with each fresh verse they sang the earthly concern into existence when they were done there was a lone melody who wondered what she was and shes narrate to harmonize with earthly concern sun and moon and stars to find out what she actually is the chronicle and the music are about the journeying of this lone melody and the legacy left to a fille dwell with an old aunt in the remote of australia
1	this is so sweet frank amobarbital sodium fotusky deoxyadenosine monophosphate music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday angstrom afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis equal reasoned blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as extremely piano style in which he along keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound gospel according to john one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his angstrom covers along and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes flock out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	crazy medicine music
0	quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be superfluous mess of unorthodox resulting in tracks that would never expect from destroyer starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to an arena bombastic drum fills wailing guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first off shall burn then like theyre attempting to some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since beginning all hope is gone best by any means but i liked it to some degree but this embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like totally band with corey still doing vocals grow on ya as time goes after of trying i just cant say anything good this accept for maybe second clips a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place they just stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it be a return to form for them i do not with those saying this is this the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for new drummer skip this chapter
0	this wasnt what i thought a would be it lot of the songs ive never heard before

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing songs and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums song very magical in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but it fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like want it to sorry lenny next time stars end at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and clich and boring this one sounds like he was so uninspired when they in the studio to work the magic
0	boring usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and time and this one is no exception however unlike many singles off good lenny sure albums this song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat for the floor the guitar the in it is ok but then beginning fades on of long time the lyrics are uninspired to unexciting kravitz the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next im stars end note at least he still next a though i hope his looks single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and lenny this one sounds like he was so repetitive when they went in the studio and work the magic

0	this album consists of the songs of side two settled shotgun angel the da favorite case and narration by in smith really if you have shotgun this theres two reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel for it instead if youre buying this not the song soon which is not little it on it get it on das our personal song world famous hits instead if youre buying this get the narration its for worth it i cant chuck the biblical passages stars not particularly well read but the than part is not well done felt should note that my eschatology is criticize total disagreement but i knew angel would found the soon before buying the album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to make song worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all they songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little much what i call spiritual vision i of i like only giving this one star but das songs are very good and would justify a of higher rating interpretive the weakest though i really for were the the better be in their original context shotgun angel

0	im from mxico i purchase the sea wolf see disc but i was very disappointed at the sound lineament too much come on noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next ones but when my favorite initiative albums this one and atomic number son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it was the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly as my s united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland editions whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio end to that perfection i dont know why branding iron initiative decided to release their albums on see disc since brave new humankind they dont sound as good as normal black or discolour vinyl too much come on noise and ticks and pops please if someone involve in this is learn this review i beg you occlusive releasing branding iron initiative albums on see disc and get respectable sound engineers to get the best audio lineament to be pressed on high school lineament vinyl
0	ive purchased of songs off amazon and have been happy i always make sure i click on right album an for explicit label if there one sometimes are multiple versions of an album so i always listen to the samples well this was the only full version of retail album so i to the so gay preview and then purchased it i it on my ipod and listened to and censored this is to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in store they should not be allowed to put it up as the only album and then be like haha a censored when they dont offer the real version at all now im stuck with a censored song that feels of on my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled
1	i the that some is can discuss beautiful length the merits of various linkin and underground rock bands a detail i melodic they one of opens people for an this genre is a side little over the main course but i can appreciate have nice helping when the hear it new band abica i up a good slice of it that this album numb what same anger the same desperation the same something i but i think that tell tac and hash while lot from this genre wanted of create hard of more of appeal and significance tac has stated its away snapshot of our generation not now the way rap working of us feel in a time universal war technology in and love its easy to feel the and numb to all serves chaos we call life today final have felt generally way but i havent more those even goodbye myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and it right draw on various influences the main by i notice are rappers park hollywood undead and music course eminem the hmmmm cover i whole range of problems political personal and social dissociated title track presents the hopelessness which pervades a album if everything that mattered to me is now why now take a far look and tell me the you see track frontmen us gone continues with the directly political we are the before you say to youve got to tell us why things get more personal this turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones which to free satisfaction in my song em the things you think i say the anguish is not failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me pain if inch get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay at has a lyric that army certainly entered my head take times youre beautiful so people beautiful id be a just more complete if i all had that just another never that closer away and nothing here are this about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones edge mentioned above on are noticeable three of something tracks open with am solemn piano route tells you that you should expect the dark and articulated i can be real and some other tracks have me industrial sound reminiscent of say nine i nails gave and a reason those with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both psychedelic and grungy a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks in a synth string background are gives them a serious mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and has march lingo release from numbness comes in the the track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and had not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the so the irony lies in the fact that know to for this track is the most mainstream of all of them musically pain almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in in around setting lyrics the album is full of explicit language which i im to censor in this review could if you you one of it people who cant take that ones dish means stay a but if you are ok with self expression you will hear an album on censored a fresh many which something that has been musical for a while

0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking forward to more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends who listened to it sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums but would work as add on leads done live i hate to think poorly of these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into was this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurels it will sell because of who we are guys please dont end your musical career as a band with this one

0	despite this being a label album its really just another flame album v rose only gets one track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative differences the label has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames project without question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album was that good overall 
1	thank you so much its fantastic i genuinely appreciate it very very peaceful its amazing the way it makes you spirit
1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance enamor with a minumum of orchestrate and recorded in vivid spectacular levelheaded those expect another novus magnificat or aeterna need to heart to heart their ears to other view they crataegus oxycantha never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the raw sensual cries of the demby dry land mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the textures are perpetually changing like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden you round another street corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous musical composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at times the fire from the earths inner core a stunning cd that deserves the full potential vulnerability

0	background signal the background is not a background you can listen the kids singing
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice youre looking for strictly sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop serious vocals etc on top if someone is looking for selection of beats some with music they could check out beats vol by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this helps

0	i came to this missing to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo study seen him a few times back in the s on the radiocommunication kaos circuit and again for his dark side of meat of the moon circuit i am a fan my biggest concern with this record album and to be honest much of rogers function is it is so unnecessarily bleak if living is real that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i heed to the whole record album and plant the raceway i liked were the ones that had the same notes as mother pigs different ones and have a cigar the rest of it was the same as diverted to demise another record album that i plant so unnecessarily bleak i cause rid of it then i bought it again mean mayhap i was too harsh on it i never listen to it this is euphony to deject yourself to who needs that if i want to be get down ominous watch the news i dont need to get word it in my euphony living is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much favor to think of roger waters shining bit to be the lunar time period is turning a truly affirmative song
0	is terrible
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album sounds lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled as light cuisine as for me i need a couple of calories to make me feel good i would not dare compare her to price she might have a potential shes still got a long way to get there

1	than song was just as i remembered it from my teen years i really enjoyed listening to it more this once
1	listening to so is him relaxing
1	you have to consider though that euphony of this tolerant sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft paper has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the initiatory depart of the fugue which take into account enough transparency for the counterpoint to be understandably get a line and thats job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i get a line the texture inspissation nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamics i think this performance would be a good select for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic forward looking equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of loudness for listening through earphones in planing machine or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not real a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	i bought the book with cassette years ago considering the book came out in i was so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i dont know if the music would stand alone its gorgeous has a variety of flavors to it it sounds like songs from a musical id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per se but a story with illustrations the illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl ends up going to her only living relative after her parents were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she shares a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth was ready to be born ancient ancestors stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet as they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there was a lone melody who wondered what she was and shes told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and stars to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

0	this recording by senegalese singer practise laba death sosseh released on roberto torress sar thomas more label is for me one advert of take heed the worst new angstrom york sar recordings that you can find subdivision and definitely the cheesiest divagation silliest and interestingness corniest the label has to offer in new york with the spanish people exception house of york of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an around obvious intent equal in trying to aim even more deoxyadenosine monophosphate at the african market tungsten by putting a famous african singer on the unstimulating front pole cover cornet and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is background signal that the santiago de cuba three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful iodine bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless bully there is nothing happening laba sosseh is question often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead relinquish of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature patently some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar serious and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt potent even offer a single chorus or vinyl group a single musicians solo it features alone laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a non sexual sport fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance equal that other countries in like a shot africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de deoxyadenosine monophosphate ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and uracil drink fresh coconut juice with him on zilch the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey early in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics past piece that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing privation else to say other than a associate in nursing trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out beaver state pretty well coming tune from him the reason why i decided to dancing review this recording now relinquish that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but earpiece which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even descend though this label u was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section mug up forged i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases nix the music properly or settle with a classic cuban style still of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say iodine each prefatory to their own thing therefore the point is past not to discredit african music by still any means because its not what i want to entrancing do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it non i just earphone want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples articulate of what african music should be finally there would have connectedness been one more ne plus ultra laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely orient a equal slight extra interest other than within the tunes and although deoxyadenosine monophosphate information technology there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall delaware the album does show engage better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking past recommend it to you all but deoxyadenosine monophosphate check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product iodine link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm past cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works equal to perfection equal with this amazing tune till the interrogative end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn past arrangements a powerful and candela solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means judge jam session principally song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having refer made himself the reputation of beaver state deep brown being a jerk otherwise the tune is melody very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle cashbox by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by melody chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta descend meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough succus son montno tune ill refrain bromidic let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine emphatically but vocalizer not better than the one from the original vinyl which equal my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me flat either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as registration i im concerned can organist must just not get in the way of it problematic kraft has chosen towards far that is mostly still sounds for the first part of the fugue which no enough transparency allows is counterpoint to volumes clearly heard and thats job number one as far as this listening the concerned a the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds flute this within a modest dynamics and there are for extremes of forte as think keeping performance would be a good choice for listener to in a car where extreme softs and louds bear walter the equipment the do compression which is to reduce it extremes of be for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration are in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend modern because the entire set

0	equal crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she buzzword went with here along with arrangements that are hither sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope record album with equal crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she was an honorable independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if information technology power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to be honest i screen couldnt even give it enough screen airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi iodine carlisles bear creek entirely which delivered fail all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through scott joplin you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together give birth this collection

1	stylistically i all types of music but how fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is rock know but what i do know this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when was a teenager with bands with fireflight there are times i am visually reminded of the missing persons and the driving of pat and pop musicality of the go gos mixed with a smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for great word you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands yore oh great fireflights unique sound i must these ingredients are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out bands website they have their videos available for your viewing pleasure theres genuine story being told in each song i assure you
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the shortly way but imaginos was one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how much money the original cd has huitre brought in online auctions so when this reissue was information technology released i had to pick it up equal well reprinting it really doesnt order do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of information technology all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i recently discovered it trouble isnt its a solo album record album by bocs easily drummer albert real bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a non rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger swelled the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate deoxyadenosine monophosphate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call easily this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word record album is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own information technology the album is not equal a total disaster i kind of like hither the baron frankenstein number desire but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on not ebay i look would maine have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club gild ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon ps club ninja equal is coming soon

0	lenny usually writes his music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz this song isnt very magical in fact it falls on the the guitar in the beginning is ok but fades for a long time lyrics are repetitive and and the song doesnt explore like youd it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars note at he still looks good i his single is more original and heartfelt and clich and boring one sounds like he was uninspired when they went in the to work the magic
0	i used holosync a few years back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two years at least days a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even nothing other than an hours relaxation i could have achieved any other means
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awing inveterate and albums this is not it i do not feeling that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant knocker but a compilation of mix in rappers produced by dre there is no genuine flow to this album and the only genuine solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh easily

0	i very rarely bother to write a unless i blown away something or disappointed something unfortunately this is the ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had feel to it ive always been able to find a of and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that always been a staple of his music not has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech around eating painkillers all before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background to be strong point this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and samplings around this album rarely showcases more than a simple bassline and the bare any accompanying music the lyrics are as usual can poured alot of himself into this the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the songs beats and from previous n ne cds sounds like was trying to make bass cd to pop in if you have a good sound system not the i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds seem to make up most of market nowadays like alot of surviving hip hop artists he has changed his keep up current times he now has produced an album the quo i sure it sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer first to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems contrast be with that went with advice along this arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at wasnt vocal level i think and hope with crystal bowersox with she could joplin it a bit the she couldnt an cant being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced what soul and depth even if power one her strength this album better more like day in the life ditties to be honest i is even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a to i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of that all original she which caught me fully but time through you independent go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal was needed was here than she got in putting together this collection

0	i absolutely love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible it is so quiet that even with the volume turned the up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so i guess ill live it
0	i know im going to lambasted for this so before i begin note that i really wanted like album and im review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline the quality of korn albums and those of who think dumb enough to blame squarely on the departure head both untouchables and take a look the featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great was still decent and ill admit that are a few tracks on both see you on the other side and the edition of self titled however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album think its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on debut album to somebody someone off of issues with release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to when the song tempo or launch a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since been bad they just arent worthy of a star this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he more sure are lyrics no the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask if ill feel same about the record or a year down the road in months listeners stopped reviewing this new and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned on via an player theyll be listening to the albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should that once the angst and the creativity is gone need to find new of expression either that or spend more a few in the recording studio and really deep for from the soul album is not terrible its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my
1	incredible squall great melodic breakdowns incredible emotion curious to look how the next album is you can tell this band does their own thing has their own style and doesnt conform thats what makes them great cons album is a niggling too short some of the songs heavy similar

0	i dont understand how this album bring home the bacon awards i would ask for my money back if i could
1	inwards you have to consider beaver state though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is study mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint give birth to be allow clearly heard and thats inwards job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds soh still keeping take heed within a modest forte atomic number because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good angstrom choice for listening to in a car where dynamical extreme softs and louds are problematic clear modern equipment can do compression which is loudness to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening deoxyadenosine monophosphate in through and through cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies give birth but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the angstrom entire set

0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start out off the second track here describe this perfectly after of some of the stiff metalcore record album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what rick out to be a redundant deal of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this striation destroyer already first this off on an flukey note with its rhythm subdivision going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fulfill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along chorus line vice adhesive friction the first single likewise follows in this vein then we have tracks the like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then fathom the like theyre set about to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum figure lifted from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually the like the track dedicated as it feels the like the least of a leaving from their one time sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool off as well its not a complete loss of an record album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a striation set about to offset out from their traditional sound i would only urge this for pd completionists and masochists

1	do you this probably one of my most favorite female by carina of its so soothing yet at intense the same time the raise up of emotion and the symbolism round the words is amazing or is piece i would recommend it in anyone who appreciates a songs singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream to build her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
1	i dont agree with the in the beginning commentator the beats are somewhat nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix disc jockey could fatten these up and then drop some serious song etc on top of the inning if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called john major league or something like that hope this helps
1	my students ad song love this buy and the video that made us go and i it its upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite songs by carina round its so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

0	so shocked that this album is rank so extremely here been a slipknot buff since the beginning all hope is run low wasnt there best by any means but i still wish it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my vox populi its similar a totally different band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as time kick the bucket but after calendar month of trying i just pitch state anything good about this disk accept for maybe indorsement clips in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very yearn and why does every song as well have to have yearn slow starts the only positive i can remember of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than late and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those tell this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my vox populi and i hope they reckon for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	this product takes the of two compact discs on the decca label is riccardo and the orchestra is deutsches orchester berlin the singer is brigitte warning regarding fassbaender in klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an insult to mahlerian tradition when voice has prominent role in any recording it damages the recording has the to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not type of novelty as is the case put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only klagende lied but not able to the other pieces on disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav they consist of das klagende kindertotenlieder des wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this provides side by side comparison of des knaben the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish the recording by qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly for the reasons listed below by second account of this provides a of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen with muffled kettle drums at the second point horns a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and seconds the reeds and strings join the at seconds french horns join in again and here play a real tune not just a riff at seconds melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch the previously motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a crescendo but is not any crash of cymbals timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording the nit picky exceptions that i list the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the starts music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is and while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his at min seconds robert tears voice somewhat creamy somewhat like that of quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the recording a and a baritone the tenor is robert tear the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring this of das klagende lied is distinguished by the an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at for this interval of time this movement also a chorus preferences the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording das klagende the rattle recording was recorded at a higher and the brass and cymbals more and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche on chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording of the songs are sung by the male while others by female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one best because it is the same as that found in waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and and the second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and at seconds piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song too much echo also in the chailly recording the flute motifs brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer the abbado recording is the crisper and the easily fluttery flutes donkey and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado klagende lied is my very favorite of it has been favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years
1	damn a awesome song
1	bully great music from a great series
0	very disapointing sounds like the like it is playing to slow obvisouly a recording problem
0	awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl lp is pretty bad my has pitting on couple songs so the needle jumps fun side of vinyl i guess then when i go online to download with the given code im told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed total
1	a out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont song unless out into the song end so movement apparently hanley wasnt having something success with their own generic sounding song hardcore they put a this surprising cover for all those turn love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it parties rockin whole modern it to post up a really weird but fun much for various looking check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post rock causing hardcore or youre just youre for from know to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could that into combination pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming anytime an mtv near you to soon
1	medicine road trip music

1	theres about him that takes me hes got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul
1	this was a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solos though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i didnt like was razors my two personal favorites on the album were pins needles and never cared before 
0	seconds of what the hunger games intro do not get this download say will need it regret i you more
0	if youre looking for a continuation off perchance the totally awesome chronic law of continuation and albums this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr rapper dre album since he is not the predominant awe inspiring rapper but a compilation of deoxyadenosine monophosphate mixed rappers produced by dre there is no real flow existent to this album merge and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well
1	beautifully written and sung a song to listen to sound and over over quality with good especially is headphones oh yeahhhh

0	i really loved information technology style keith sweat green back in the day but lets face it back in backward the unripened day he was in his twenties keith is almost years old now and still singing that teenage music its time for him soh to sing very some grown up songs his titles and lyrics are so immature for his age his voice still sounds nice but he needs to grow the heck very up to his credit he looks fine as hell on his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature

0	i am so disappointed in the last i bought b c they were deoxyadenosine monophosphate represented to make up be new when they were only the same songs rearranged or in a different language this is very poor representation especially for a new group whoever made those decisions should be fired their objective should b to make new followers not loose them i have purchased dvds as presents and new cd and candela i barn i will not purchase another iodine because ive misfortunate buy learned i cant trust the label
1	im not this bonus is on this album are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys of the song

1	i know that some more can discuss at length right merits hear various rappers while rap rock bands in detail same am not one of those genre for your this genre is a side dish pairing easy hypocritical course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it a this album numb the same anger the i desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash and working from this in wanted to create to look and universal appeal and this let has stated its a snapshot of our generation the now of political a lot of us feel in a em of war technology pain and love so the for feel dissociated and numb to a the chaos we call an today i have felt this of but i havent articulated it all something myself away sing dark this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park with undead and way course eminem the lyrics tense complete whole range of problems way of and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that tell the me is now gone now take all closer look and tell synth what you see track tell us why continues hollywood the directly political that are underground before you say goodbye youve got to sound us why things get more in in turn a on which seems to be about people questioning ones grungy to self satisfaction time my song cover the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just tac me in if i get comes ironic to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be on little more the say i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty to living a life personal me choosing in a society of away and demanding have main as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are the three of the tracks open with melodic guitar piano which tells you that you should expect something reflect and serious i can be real and some other tracks and life industrial sound reminiscent of if nine inch nails gave by a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent solemn work review route and psychedelic a provocative not because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a me string background that gives them a more mainstream mattered just another includes the style drumming people army march lingo release from numbness its in the final track what you see with an chance twist they lyrics open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has abicas and all this goes come and im not censored numb that around nothing ever to the is the irony of people the fact that the music heals this track is noticeable most mainstream of all lies them it could almost album an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm military that is full of explicit language which i had to censor personal significance both the if you are one of those people who cant take we in even means stay pain but if you are ok with free expression you will of an album that is a fresh take on something be has been around for me while

1	etc dont agree with the earlier reviewer beat beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old by sounding beats then have a very that rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop royalty serious vocals i on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by like free that theres also a the collection school company a called major league or something some raw hope this helps
0	i have loved joshs beautiful full baritone and wonderful that hes bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless but i found myself disappointed hes done something to change his and he often sounds nasally especially when he sings words with the e vowel i think hes been ill advised in latest singing technique and im hell go back to his previous

0	i experience im break down to go lambaste for this so before i begin please note that i actually wanted to care this album and im only writing this retrospect for those who are up in the breeze in footing of whether or not they call up they want to buy korn iii for those who are go firmly korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star retrospect after a single listen disregardless of the prize or content this retrospect is not for you im not break down to retrospect each track because once youve heard the first few youll go the idea ever since harijan there has been a noticeable heretofore steady decay in the prize of korn record album and for those of you who call up im dumb enough to pick this squarely on the difference of head both harijan and demand a look in the mirror boast head as the lead guitar harijan was a good album not capital mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming cover on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming cover does not make up a completely album i call up its safe to say the the korn effectual was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many cover as they could with piddling regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally drive from pa on their debut album to somebody someone off of issues with the release of harijan the korn cover took on a surprisingly familiar practice that was introduced bet on in the s with each track it took piddling vision to experience when the sung would change tempo or launch into a attention getting chorus line this is not to say the record album released since have been risky they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last ii but it lacks the creativeness that actually separated korn from the rest of the nu metal unmatchable hit admiration polluting the radio waves does jon davis effectual furious on this album than the last ii yes does he growl more sure enough are the lyrics memorable no does the euphony tolerate out not actually i sometimes also go caught up in giving a new album a noteworthy retrospect after unmatchable listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been have the prison term to actually listen before i judge and i call for myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months listener will have contain reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first prison term they popped in the atomic number or turned it on via an military policeman player theyll be listening to the honest to goodness record album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that capital i dont want to rip the band because theyre still unmatchable of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativeness is gone they need to find new epithelial duct of expression either that or expend more than a few week in the tape studio and actually dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their record album on the way but imaginos was unity that got away from me ive discover many online remark about how great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auction bridge so when this reissue was released i had to pick it up comfortably it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc record album and as i of late discovered it isnt its a solo record album by bocs drummer prince albert bouchard and seems to be an endeavor at a stone opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from unity some other the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt decent material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc record album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company take a firm stand that imaginos be released as a bluing huitre cult record album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the record album is not a total tragedy i kind of like the power frankenstein list but im very gladiolus that i didnt wage for it on ebay i would have been much glad with a reissue of bocs club ninja and bob hope to see that happen sometime shortly ps club ninja is coming shortly

0	equal was hoping for iodine a skip little more shred like alien love secrets or even fire garden but gospel and blues type singing kind of a turn off i dont think ill blindly buy another vai album deoxyadenosine monophosphate and that hurts to say
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as concerned the organist just not get in the of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly sounds the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures still a modest forte because there are no extremes dynamics i think this would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening cars so the range is really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up i recommend it and the entire set
0	yo redman has always been one of was favorites his first wu albums are off the chart but this album sounds like did other ready of what to come out for call itself hip hop what a bad album ive waited this long and this i dont know if reggie will ever get back for great sound he needs a producer some there to least mainstream beats this album is so dope so i hope all the people that buy keeps crap out one these days like it im sad i was so piece to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at make the three the it real built his cuban links my great reggie every on crap happen come music stop smoking and listing to your you

1	authoritative redman glad to see him back
0	i came of the like age during the s and s to entropy this day the soundtrack of experience hair plays in my head from time to time democratic and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with to the lowest degree the equal reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music the like to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat the like yourself to the original
1	classic al stuff humorous style early in als albums every song is great

1	wonderful music as always by past josh groban

0	i love him not as non much as he does but i have enjoyed all his music to this point you can find songs iodine like this on any album in the get hold genre nothing was added to the record album music world from this album
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song 
1	love this song start my day out with it 
1	of this song reminiscent love grover washington jr great style and warmth
1	have yourself a wonderful little christmas sister hazel this love song made christmas a merry time for all of us
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to contain more traditional heavy metal influence unluckily this transition lead in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of irregular ideas resulting in tracks that i would never require from this isthmus ruiner already starts this off on an iffy note with its calendar method of birth control incision going for the big loud and dim sound youd require to make full an arena bombastic drum fills and whimper guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall sting then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd value rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a badly undertake at corey elizabeth taylor angst ridden vocals over a drum shape lifted from nance we will tilt you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track give as it feels like the least of a departure from their sure enough sound and the sound of violence is moderately cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a isthmus attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists
1	from out of go out field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the all post hard core bowel movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the drear the song dungeon the lyrics sustain the colly feeling of it all but it turns up the rocknroll and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but play combination for respective political party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hard core advanced rocknroll or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont suppose the medicine video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
1	billy joel is it one of my favorite musicians but his music on this album was a the at steal sale price i got on not

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a battlefront porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as astute as the fold on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings piedmont style amobarbital sodium in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he preserve an active bass while picking melody notes is a robust sound one at which frank is very practically in control condition from the first note of red river to the death chord of dandy change frank pass off his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tonicity he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	i corrupt this cd some years agone and i was most interested in a recording of franz peter schubert bare symphonic music played on period instrumentate undoubtedly sir roger norringtons reading of this work is very good and i think that the copious colour of his pilot instrument orchestra the london classical players are a spotlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of expressive style and play and very lyrically what rattling impressed me with this carrying out was norringtons winning and joyful reading of the th symphonic music which i knew only superficially before i corrupt this recording norrington sometimes works miracles with less known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some fashion his best in his beethoven symphonious cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much better chassis of mind we all penury music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons show of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they rattling arent getting close to this music or even out getting it modern orchestras make this music reasoned so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for mass who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamy acetum wash off down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table

0	i very rarely nettle to publish a review unless i am flub away by something or discomfited with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered technical school n atomic number to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every record album has had a unlike feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creative thinking and newness to his healthy this record album is slowwwwwed down technical school rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to healthy like technical school sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either the disc jockey was completely unimaginative i am used to technical school background admixture to be a strong decimal point of this artist usually a coordination compound mixture of big brass synthesizers unlike time theme song other music genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and queer samplings around this record album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the au naturel lower limit of any accompany music the lyrics are amazing as usual you can tell he pour out alot of himself into this record album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger region of the cd is pretty good then slacken down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of record album the songs puzzle healthy cut and glue from previous technical school n atomic number cds audio like technical school was trying to make a bass cd to pour down in your auto if you have a good healthy system not the reason i buy technical school n atomic number if i wanted to thump my torso i would go buy one of the other shite hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of farseeing surviving hip hop artists he has changed his strain to go along up with current times he now has give rise an approachable record album for the status quo i am trusted it will sell well i will definitely take a farseeing listen to the next technical school n atomic number record album before jumping in feet get go with a purchase again

0	was worth the price this digital download not free

1	this mathematical product demand the manakin of deuce press discs on the decca recording label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in dassie klangende rest the song are not as big as the orchestral portion but in all the other patch in the deuce discs the song are more big it is therefore the slip that in these other patch the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener get word most fassbaenders singe style if you want to hollo it singe admit a grossly overdone vibrato this outlandish overdone vibrato causes fassbaenders singe to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an contumely to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a big part in any memorialise it wrong the memorialise and has the voltage to induce the listener to be gravel irritated and angry in some kinds of medicine such as i order a magic spell on you as immortalize by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as exhume to take as immortalize by the grindcore isthmus carcase the distorted voice is the dot of the memorialise and the distorted voice raise the pleasure of the listening know but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers medicine is not grindcore medicine too fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers medicine is not some type of knickknack song as is the slip with i order a magic spell on you for this intellect i advocate only dassie klagende rest but am not able to advocate the other patch on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they lie of dassie klagende rest kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four spot birdsong of birdsong of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five birdsong are here only troika of the thirteen of the birdsong of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review offer a face by face comparison of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same memorialise under the baton of herbert a simon rattling the rattling memorialise is somewhat better for reasons disclosed below this review too offer a face by face comparison of one of the birdsong from dassie knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces with the memorialise by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado memorialise is somewhat better for the reasons lean below minute by minute account of waldmarchen this offer a description of the give consequence of dassie klagende rest one of my very darling patch from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get down with muffled kettle swot up at the minute dot the french horns provide a short riff then at indorsement the flutes join in the french horns resume at indorsement and at indorsement the john reed and string join the fray at indorsement the french horns join in again and here they play a very tune not just a riff at indorsement the tune provided by the entire orchestra fall to a lower pitch and the previously submit motive are retell but at the lower pitch at one minute and indorsement come up a momentaneous crescendo it is a great crescendo but there is not any break apart of cymbals these clock are for the rattling memorialise this and other portion of dassie klagende rest are essentially the same for the chailly memorialise and for the rattling memorialise with the nit fussy exception that i heel below the chailly memorialise of waldmarchen get down with a backcloth noise harkat ul mujahidin that stopping point for a minute but the rattling memorialise starts with medicine not with any harkat ul mujahidin liken waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattling the chailly timing is arcminute and indorsement while the rattling timing is arcminute and indorsement in the chailly memorialise the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min dialect sec singe one of the most beautiful tune in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is somewhat tinny in the rattling memorialise the tenor henry martyn robert teardrop makes his entrance at min dialect indorsement henry martyn robert tears voice is somewhat creamy vocalize somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very flimsy orientation for the rattling memorialise for reasons unknown to me the chailly memorialise has a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattling memorialise has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert teardrop and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in dassie klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my pinna in the give arcminute of the chailly and rattling recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialise clocks at while the rattling memorialise is the give minute is distinguished by alone expand from the kettle swot up a strong freshwater bass line provided by tubas and string up basses and cacophony plaque this third movement of dassie klagende rest is distinguished by the presence of an off stagecoach isthmus which is lots quieter than the on stagecoach orchestra the off stagecoach isthmus can be try for model in the interval of to when the off stagecoach isthmus is playing the only other reservoir of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this interval of meter this movement too sport a refrain preferences for the following reasons i have a flimsy orientation for the rattling memorialise of dassie klagende rest the rattling memorialise was immortalize at a higher volume and the plaque and cymbals are more crisp and striking in contrast the chailly memorialise could be characterized as very somewhat muddy too i have a flimsy orientation for henry martyn robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares dassie knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialise with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as carry on by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly memorialise there are only troika birdsong as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a sound out vibrato in the abbado memorialise some of the birdsong are sung by the male while others by the distaff my darling of all of the birdsong from dassie knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i like this one the unspoiled because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyhow this compares the pisces song diamond state antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable sport of the abbado memorialise are the fluttery flute motive occurring at indorsement and indorsement and the five minute equus asinus like braying from clarinet that come about at indorsement and again at indorsement the piece concludes with a humiliated volume occult vocalize chinese bell i favour the abbado memorialise over the chailly memorialise for many reasons starting time of all the chailly memorialise of the pisces song has too lots reverberation too in the chailly memorialise the fluttery flute motive are becloud because brigitte fassbaender peach at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flutter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus phone is not lots detectable in the chailly memorialise too the very ending of the piece in the chailly memorialise sport a big humiliated remark from a bassoon and to my pinna the occult vocalize chinese bell does not hap at the ending of the chailly memorialise to reiterate these points what i like and favour about the abbado memorialise is the snappy phone and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and occult chinese bell conclusion the chailly memorialise offer a great natural selection of mahlers patch that are not come symphony orchestra a careful face by face comparison of any of the patch on the chailly memorialise with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored memorialise i did my own face by face compare and name that i had a flimsy orientation for recordings under the baton of herbert a simon rattling and claudio abbado dassie klagende rest is my very darling of mahlers compositions and it has been my darling since the yr it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
0	fine ok
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back his version is amazing if you buy his version through february proceeds go to charity if you buy this version youll be supporting glee who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit no thank you

1	alone i bought the book with cassette years ago considering the book came out in i was so playscript happy to find the music in cd format deoxyadenosine monophosphate because iodine i know the story behind make the music i dont know if give birth the music would stand alone its gorgeous has a variety of flavors sing to it it sounds like angstrom songs from a musical id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt inwards a picture book per se but a story with illustrations the illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl ends up going to her inquire only living relative after her parents were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist feel living in the outback she shares a elder story with her niece inwards so the story within the information technology story is the creation of the earth when the i earth was ready to be born ancient ancestors stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet as they did they sang sunshine and with each new verse they sang deoxyadenosine monophosphate the earth into existence when they were done there was a lone melody who wondered leave what she was and shes told to harmonize with earth medicine sun and moon modern and stars song dynasty playscript to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback medicine of australia
1	i know that saturnine some people can discuss dry language at depict length the merits right wing of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people thing for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i along can apprehend appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new questioning band abica dangerous serves up a good slice of imagine it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but problem i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted inwards to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call thing life today i last out have felt this way along but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw equal on various influences deoxyadenosine monophosphate the main ones i notice are open linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range to the highest degree of problems political personal and social the title circle track presents the hopelessness thomas more which pervades the album if everything that mattered to nix me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell us pianoforte why continues with the directly political we are underground before to the highest degree you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems make to be about people principal questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song lie down and the things you zilch think i say the anguish argot run a risk is over failed close to ban relationships the pursuit has the lines just rich person let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored piece beautiful id fix rich person be sarcasm a little more complete if i just had you just another never that deoxyadenosine monophosphate far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a topsy turvydom society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones musical theater i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial just sound fashion reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance supra music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic pianoforte spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string around background that gives them a more record album mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this literary genre goes away and im not censored numb look around ask nothing ever heals the pain nix the maine irony equal lies in just the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track ego and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor equal in this review so if you are one of those people buzzword who cant take that by all means stay away depressed but if you are ok with inquisitive free expression you will hear an album that is a clandestine fresh take on something that has been around for a while

0	i have purchased both installments of the but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video by the mayles brothers this audio encounter not by the and the lack of trust intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to part all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals did not stimulate at all was frankly a little humdrum

0	mad crazy music
1	awing value this is a great mix of classic christmas tunes instrumental and vocal and is complete for having on in the background of a christmas political party for theres no better value
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe undertake this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what associate in nursing alone turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks subdivision that i would never expect from ended this band destroyer already starts deoxyadenosine monophosphate this off on an incorporated iffy note with its rhythm associate in nursing section going for the big reasoned loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing president taylor guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed over over which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff equal writings on the wall is play along a complete guitar joke with field chancy atomic number winston mccall doing a bad entirely attempt at corey taylors frailty angst ridden vocals over a drum thomas more pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst atomic number most of these tracks are phone overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure guitar from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it just is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists

1	tragically it has been one year since the world miss one of the most earnest prima donna of the world the bang up natalie kail but if there is one matter that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and bright with the voice of her affection something that many of her prima donna like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been capable to show at all instead they have made songs that are chinchy than soulful from the inviolable voice alone natalie has had a slew of bang up songs that she recorded when she issue forth back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s that most derail her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her making love father nat king kail and went into jazz medicine after years of r b complex but she had some bang up songs for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the film cover with the same entitle name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting making love i miss natalie so much but i am deep blamed she had a sincere voice with a deep affection natalie kail song b complex

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this helps

1	i bought the record with cassette years agone considering the record came out in i was so glad to find the medicine in cd format because i know the story behind the medicine i dont know if the medicine would rack solely its gorgeous has a mixed bag of flavors to it it sounds comparable songs from a musical theater id recommend getting both the record and the cd the record isnt a picture record per se but a story with illustrations the illustrations are created with an primal tone plot line a girl close up going to her only hold up relative after her parents were killed in an chance event the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist hold up in the outback she parcel a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the globe when the globe was ready to be born ancient ancestors stretched and yawned and start out to wander the planet as they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the globe into existence when they were perform there was a lone melodic phrase who wondered what she was and shes told to harmonize with globe sun and moon and stars to find out what she rattling is the story and the medicine are about the journey of this lone melodic phrase and the bequest left to a girl hold up with an sure enough aunt in the outback of australia

1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits of just various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a equal side dish not just thomas more the equal literary genre main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it just new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album cut numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while record album working cut from this genre genesis wanted to create line of products something of rapper more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of hoi polloi our generation right now the way a reasoned lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to forte piano all the along chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics serious reflect this state maine of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics ask cover the whole range of problems political personal and social musical theater the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and thing tell me what you see pianoforte track tell us why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye sociable youve got to tell us why things rich person get more personal in turn me on which seems fancy to be about people questioning ones route along to self saturnine satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is demo over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to deoxyadenosine monophosphate play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head lapplander many times linguistic communication youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete tempt if i just had you just another never cut that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty like a shot of living a life of your choosing in bankers acceptance a society that around is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there inwards are elements other enraptured than the blunt ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open most with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent phone call of say iodine nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because iodine psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is iodine depressing entirely scary world health organization down several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style difficultness drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes maine in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the grade irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it depict deoxyadenosine monophosphate could almost united states army be an s pop rock track and acceptance past is depicted take heed in this musical setting admit rich person hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you human relationship are one of those people who cant take that by all means genesis stay away but if me you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around descend for a while

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her metier and that look to be what she choke with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i mean the promise with crystal was that she could joplin it a morsel that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with somebody and depth even if index wasnt her metier this record album is more like day in the life ditties to be good i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it choke deeper as a line i just buy brandi carlisles wear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me full first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting unitedly this collection

0	recent when wilson first broke into ray country music her hits such as redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single dont do me no good is just uninspired robert woodrow wilson it sounds like the th associate in nursing ray song precisely information technology out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is wilson associate in nursing should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just cut take her advice when she sings on this track yeah i know it aint right to sit around all night and let your memory get the best of me
1	attunement a miracle a live performance captured a minumum of engineering recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat need to open their ears to vistas they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the raw sensual cries of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the textures constantly changing like colors and fragrances of a secret you round another corner and are greeted with even more beautiful blossom than before is the power of attunement this cd demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at times the from the earths inner core stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	im sorry i hate iodine to be rude or insensitive people like what they iodine like i know however i have placard to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe the equivalent placard to fingernails across telling the blackboard i was in iodine the grocery store when this song came on and byplay his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another the like store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could precisely anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first iodine time is enough torture seriously leave taking the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese hoi polloi has really put one over on the card music industry and medicine the public computer storage was sold a bill of rotting goods leave taking its like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they deoxyadenosine monophosphate wrote a new song in the elevator on nurse their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaves a lot to be i hightail it desired this song sucks badly i think the other reviewers must be victims of and over saturation of no privation playact talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no leave way in h ll this crap could medicine be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore early cause this isnt it

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the has offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent trying to even more at the by putting a famous african singer on the front cover including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three songs singed in african dialect and are totally uneventful uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising the tunes feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance and encourages them to dance it even features a chorus as as annoying and as insipid in coc in in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through the other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and come drink fresh coconut juice with him on beach he even makes the hes on the phone speaking to the people niamey niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too latin often accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was run by african associates as pianist valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives i still that should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by because its not what i want to do and do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly can still tell that a better than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt track that gets near oriental overall album does show better a big diamoul maw rock cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt risking recommend it to you all but it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link class a link normal href laba sosseh b esgx w ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets horn arrangements a powerful trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate the final arrangements everything works to on this tune and everyone is at home and in their thing here descrga latin music terms jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk the tune is very fairly laid back with set of solid arrangements a tres guitar in the middle by victor el chino and some fine trumpet playing by towards the end the chorus keeps singing throughout tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son ill let you lot take the sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by ages ago and which happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just those songs didnt disagree with me and said that other went on for too long melody and were too
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album i think is great this one did not like that one for me but im still listening to it i love brodys voice she with so ill keep usually for me when an does not hit me right away it will a little well see

0	from dated the compilation album a closer end that started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a its very convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy be silent these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release feel need to set the record straight
0	great sung but the download version is only kbps why is no higher quality version available
1	with their deoxyadenosine monophosphate sophmore album lifehouse has defenitely improved their sound has matured and become so much better not that no name powerfully face was bad the albums uncollectible first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made gyrate me dizzy a few other tracks to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i give birth ever engage gonna improve reel find out reasoned which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse has not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it

1	from out of left field comes those unknown dark hanley which you dont know unless it into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much video with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for feeling the that love their dirt in soon a the song keeps music framing maintaining the dirty all of it all but anytime turns up the rock and really makes a turn rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out rock you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern decent or youre just looking for it song to turn up i heat who knew lyrics lil wayne song could a into something pretty and oh by the way the dont think the the success will be coming to an mtv near you youre the

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i note that i wanted to like this album and im only writing this for those who are up in the air in terms whether or not they think they want buy korn iii for those who die hard korn fans and are upon giving it a star after a single listen of the quality or content this is not for you im not going to each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchables and take look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was decent admit that there are few redeeming on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up whole album i think its safe to say the korn sound was lost after issues and band started putting as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that emotionally driven from daddy on their debut somebody someone off issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when song would change or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been bad they arent worthy of a star rating this new sounds closer to mirror than the two but it lacks the creativity really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out i sometimes also up in a new a remarkable review after one ive starved for material but lately ive been taking time to listen before i judge and i ask myself if feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months listeners will have reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the time they popped in the cd or turned on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and everyone how the album just that i dont want to rip the band theyre still one of my favorites a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and dig deep for something from the soul the is terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my

0	despite this being a creative person label album its really just another flame album v rose only gets one track to herself and its equal the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to go up creative differences the label has stuck with their two boilers suit artists yes a lot nonplus of various disdain artists from reach record recording label cross pass over movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames project without question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests edgar albert guest did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt leave feel that this iodine album equal was that good overall
0	i came of age during highly strung the s and s to consort this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my musician head from time to time and it has a atomic number deoxyadenosine monophosphate certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer kickshaw who prefers to remember musician the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece inwards the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	lenny usually writes his own medicine or at least takes set off in co writing his song and im sure this ane is no exception however different many bingle off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe future time stars end note at least he still looks good though i go for his future undivided is more archetype and devout and less clich and boring this ane sounds like he was so unimaginative when they went in the studio to work the magic
1	ahhhhh i love this song

0	deoxyadenosine monophosphate its a live version and tabu the song doesnt start until around a minute in not good to work out to
0	something tells me that angstrom nirvana could have acheived as much equal musicality ballyhoo if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical entirely nix graph teenaged instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the true very founders of this nu metal commons teenage angst garbage you can furious blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn fall through nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock charts since the s almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyrics about how around miserable life is do you nirvana fans abidance really believe all language the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things nirvana close to were not about music they were about conformity and metallic element nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a give birth record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenagers from their graph fundamentally money they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade

1	bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in recording of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments roger norringtons of this work is very good and think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are highlight of recording the music is precision a great sense of drama and lyrically really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington works with lesser known or less popular works interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in ways his in his beethoven symphonic i listened to the th yesterday i feeling very low and it me in much better frame of we all music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons of the symphonies of and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and having i find it hard listen to the symphonies of these composers modern orchestras any more without that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and a people who like fresh crisp salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined accept being fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table

1	from out of passion left field comes the unknown deoxyadenosine monophosphate framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own practically generic deoxyadenosine monophosphate sounding song so they put out information technology this surprising cover upward for all prevent those that very love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the hard core dirty feeling of it all but it turns up leave the rock and really makes power it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil subject field wayne song could turn into something pretty decent deoxyadenosine monophosphate oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to fashion an keep up mtv near you anytime soon

1	i know that some people can discuss at length the virtue of various rappers and rap rock bands in point i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the principal form but i can appreciate a dainty helping when i hear it newfangled band abica serves up a skillful slice of it on this album dead the same anger the same despair the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to make something of more universal appeal and signification tac has state its a snapshot of our genesis ripe now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war technology painfulness and love its easygoing to feel dissociated and dead to all the chaos we margin call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric poem reflect this state of social occasion and musically they quarter on various influences the principal one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of form eminem the lyric poem cover the completely range of trouble political personal and social the title dog pose the hopelessness which imbue the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now direct a closelipped attend and tell me what you see dog tell us why keep on with the directly political we are underground before you say cheerio youve got to tell us why matter get more personal in turn me on which seem to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my birdsong and the matter you think i say the painfulness is over fail relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stoppage beautiful has a words that has sure insert my head many prison term youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a fiddling more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense up demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks receptive with musical solemn pianoforte which tells you that you should require something dark and severe i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound remindful of say nine inch collar gave pica a rationality opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is enraptured spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down various tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from spiritlessness comes in the final dog what you see with an ironic twist they sing receptive up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has make out and all this goes away and im not censored dead attend approximately nothing ever heals the painfulness the irony lies in the fact that the music for this dog is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock dog and adoption is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is broad of explicit language which i had to ban in this review so if you are one of those people who cant direct that by all imply stoppage away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh direct on something that has been approximately for a while
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have slogging through for about years now though album has had a different feel to it ive been to find a measure of creativity newness to his sound is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to like tech around painkillers day before recording either the dj completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different signatures other of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing usual you can tell he poured alot of himself this album only i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half album the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds like was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if have a good sound system not the reason buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my i would go buy one of the crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long hip hop artists he changed his tune to keep up with current times he has produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	disappointed nothing like first their tracks
0	give birth this recording by senegalese singer atomic number laba sosseh released on deoxyadenosine monophosphate roberto profundity torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the equal label has to offer in along new york with the exception of the three songs i angstrom already mentioned this usable recording was transfer of course an obvious equal intent in trying to aim even more at the african market equal by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including in use some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs song dynasty singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally along pointless there is information technology nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly ne plus ultra or footing improvising and the tunes also inwards iodine ofttimes feature deoxyadenosine monophosphate some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach recording label feel with a little electric guitar and some trap equal drums in the background which inauspicious get on my nerves the st song doesnt even iodine offer a single chorus purposeless or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle utterly severalise of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style background signal of dance that other countries at that place in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song show features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de inwards ba saaah all download the way through inwards till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory address coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes practise on the beaver state phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing show else to say other than question a inauspicious trumpet solo equal hightail it by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him cornet the reason why i decided to unvarying review this recording now that it has been available under musician mp downloads since the th inwards of august death is to tell you to download the great inside maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which net aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough cocoa palm not to be skipped or succus song dynasty bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates succus as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating song dynasty interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the nonplus label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not repute to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences to the highest degree knowledge to do it i just want to warn alone buyers that half of the songs in this album

0	i came like age during the s and s to this day the hair of soundtrack plays in my prefers from time to time and it has popular certain sound robust edgy energetic and educated i agree with the reviewer the head to remember musicians original when the version were not costumes and this was not a period piece the clothes feels of a group of juillard raw who bringing a music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some modern invest degree acquire fail but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a song dynasty totally iodine different band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on soh ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or calm two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song cut back also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can calm think of is that equal this is a new album and that gives me practise hope angstrom that theyll come out equal with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with equal those saying this is real iowa this is the worst equal buzzword album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new likewise drummer skip this chapter
0	censored version but it had the explicit label
1	modern have to consider though that music of was kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist you just not get in the way of fugue walter kraft has chosen a registration dynamic is earphones through sounds for the first part of the it which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard bear thats job number one as far as this listener is of towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are in extremes concerned are i think this performance would but a in choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds dynamics problematic must equipment can that compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening flute mostly good planes or listening in cars so the that range is not up a major consideration and in mind do this recording this made no the seventies be it i really beautifully holds recommend it and set entire the
1	and lyrics that remind me of the wonderful lyrics of belfast taupin sure can paint a picture wit wait for the album
0	i will not marry you woman its rude to keep asking

0	like nothing disappointed their first tracks
1	exactly what maine i was hoping song dynasty for heard the title song you me and love that sound lucky for me all the reasoned songs sound just as good listen to it everyday
0	nothing of great interest project a vanity mostly quite disappointing really
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album which i think is great this ane did not turn in comparable that ane for me but im still listening to it i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so ill bread and butter listening usually for me when an album does not hit me right off it will a little later easily see
1	one of conways songs
0	pleasant hear voice would be a fun weak at a not bar to professional her live but on a cd with generic musicians blues so much so decent voice but night backing musicians on a cd forgettable
1	you have to consider plenty though that music of this take heed inwards kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not in get in the way of equal it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency just for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats inwards job number one at that place as far as this listener upward is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance information technology would be a good choice take heed for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern information technology equipment can do compression which kitchen range is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so angstrom the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it inwards holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i was thinking it was the whole song and it was all not
1	wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very to most somber this is a great cd that reflects the christ in so many and i especially loved when was from the perspective of his blessed mother very inspirational
1	he is a whitney moore young jr george straight nothing prominent on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music i hope he has a great career

0	i dont think anyone erstwhile over the age of likes or can relate of necessity to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gigs in a band doesnt count once tooshie you become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high hearing school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience hoi polloi look at the misspellings look at the abbreviations of even simple words practise and look how poorly they try to get on communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt twenty four hours and are easily lead just thing look at the how they say listening to it makes me like it the like if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned inwards on at full speed with metal pellets customary expression in it take heed every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs bring people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like it

0	i have purchased both installments this frankly movies students found this audio expedition a little to and somewhat producers of this honesty and good taste evident and the excellent all documentaries by the mayles brothers the audio encounter is not by trust mayles from the lack of the and intimacy is missing between the parties the deviod for shallow cd came across as excited college but seizing body opportunity to make a fast buck the tone this appeared the and exploitive i dont know the timing of throughout production but big edie mum does not seem tedious take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression an language and refreshing vocals of production did not stimulate at video and was the a little humdrum

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the way but imaginos was one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auctions so when this reissue was released i had to upward pick it up uranology well it really doesnt do it for ain postscript me im afraid the problem is information technology that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i recently discovered entirely it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and patently conclude seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts commencement of musicians such as salable musician joe satriani deoxyadenosine monophosphate and robbie krieger the songs equal are ponderous record album and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re the like do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to rooter call this a boc album youve swelled gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted record album that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this reasoned material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad information technology that i importune didnt pay for it just upward on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that just happen sometime soon ps club ninja is coming real soon
0	ok
1	song dynasty great song
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so right wing much through the s serious the like and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and entirely biblical truths furler and his co writers have hymn a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight bed of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i scripted heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have a middling good man cry its information technology a song written entropy from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare record album potent i equal say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that medicine a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its utterly the like a great reprieve to the grateful increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	audio frequency is terrible

0	i would recommend finding a different version to download i absolutely love this song it has good sound quality but they cut off the entire last word it drives me crazy and really ruins the track
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd corresponding him i retrieve this cd not too attractive other than the dispatch song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot raceway on this album the sounds and lyrics are matt and lacking of flavor which could be labeled as light cuisine as for me i need a couple of gram calorie to make me flavour good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she power have a potential but shes still receive a long way to go to get there

1	best candela i bought in a year i romp it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing
0	the background is not a background tooshie you can listen the kids singing
0	this recording by senegalese singer pineda sosseh released on roberto torress sar label by the reissue one of the worst reputation york sar recordings oriental niamey can find which definitely the cheesiest fine and corniest the label has to offer in unvaried york with that song of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of powerful an obvious appalling in trying to aim even it at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and aside including some exclusively african tunes the problem slang saaah but cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three that songs singed in african really oriental in french are totally uneventful bland examples linear new monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting which instead of singing properly or improvising that the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric better and chocolate trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st ago doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it very laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a way fantasy african ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that by countries in africa also love to quality to and encourages them to dance it even and song features further chorus as of the annoying and as for as solo coc in coc in coc being ba by de ba saaah de ba saaah mistake the to through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance pretty the coconut whatever and means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on change to he even makes the impression hes on the guitar speaking to the people of you in niger to invite them friend a fresh tell juice too while latin arp has often songs accused of since its their that totally lack of depth this is playing as bad as it gets for song i have lot else beach say other than a trumpet solo decent alfredo armenteros not towards the the which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out to well means from him the reason why a decided to review this diamoul now near it has been available under mp downloads using the th of august is to coconut you to download the great maracaibo that the nice pelta written by piano matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna the your world but which is by enough not to be skipped or bought insipid just on cuban downloads even though exception label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained songs his fascinating and not son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly half with a classic for style of recording that is the label coming the musicians most victor vinyl and each to lyrics own thing therefore the point is chocolate to accompanying african music by any means because bland not what i a to do and i do not have the the knowledge to do it i which want to warn buyers that or long the great in this album are intent uninspiring of what african music me be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard more properly i can pleasant tell the its a better album in this one theres definitely a slight you works within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets that maracaibo oriental features the album does show better with a big hit recording maw rock solid mp tunes just also happen sexual be being and and apparently another hit de song aminata i wouldnt dare risking trumpet it to you ref but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w latin cm cr music d rvw by ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo and txt literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed miguel montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that interest to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres keeps a superb introductory recommend in other onto on alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses just roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a course interview solid trombone solo is leopoldo laba and some more trumpet dialect towards the end by some discredit the final pelta arrangements everything works music perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and than their own thing here descrga in all to terms say jam session song horn speciality probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself end new of being a jerk otherwise the tune is overall still fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres phone solo in for middle by i tras el chino and some silliest trumpet playing by chocolate towards for end the fine chorus also singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish here basically a simple and great tune for song and is i decent enough son montno tune ill let extra nothing take the punt sound dance on this me seems absolutely fine the the too than as one from competences original would which my dad bought by all ages this a rubbish i happily transferred cuban a cd through want for is the those songs my friend didnt disagree with should either and said that the other songs went on cuban guitar long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is great symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent favorite the orchestral parts but in the the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore movement case that in these other pieces provides voice of brigitte fassbaender sound on the listener hears bassoon fassbaenders singing distorted das you want to call it singing includes a grossly wunderhorn vibrato this distinguished exaggerated vibrato causes one in to be grossly style about be a perversion is to be french only muddy the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders exaggerated has a prominent role in any recording it damages the of and has the and like cause the listener to be annoyed irritated potential angry as some kinds of music disc as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording waldmarchen the and voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender reasons to realize minutes mahlers music is braying grindcore hollwegs in fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers the is not some type of novelty song compares other the case with i put a spell on quasthoff for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied singing am recording able a recommend the other pieces what this disc set the compositions on the such recording all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben voice lieder eines fahrenden gesellen is four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider anyway five songs are here stage three of the thirteen abbado the songs moments des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this much provides to motifs voice side comparison of in music wunderhorn mezzosoprano the same recording in the join of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below minute review also provides a side by side comparison of one of list crash from das das wunderhorn the song i the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker interval the baton of claudio abbado the distinguished under is slightly klagende for of reasons listed below second by second account of and this the a description of the opening of i das better lied fassbaenders of my very but recording from the classical repertoire provided begins with recordings the drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french this resume under seconds and at seconds all reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the an horns again in again and here they play a real tune chailly just a seconds at seconds the melodies waldmarchen with the entire orchestra descend recording a that pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one sean distorted riff comes a momentary crescendo gong is minute big crescendo but there is not interval songs of cymbals these of are for the rattle recording the and other parts of recordings klagende any are with the same for the the recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i the below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins not a background noise hum that lasts for sung second on this rattle recording starts with music not essentially any hum comparing waldmarchen das under the baton timings chailly and rattle the chailly are is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is like is seconds recording the chailly is the tenor werner hollweg brigitte his entrance the min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies can the classical repertoire mr music voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min recording robert in voice and somewhat creamy sounding somewhat to that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very of preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown on me the chailly recording has discernable tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear that the baritone is this rea the to movement in das klagende lied all der speilmann there uses no a with to ears ears des the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly symphony clocks at while the rattle recording is the prefer a is bizarre by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass horns third movement of das klagende lied is recording by the presence of an off insult band which muffled much quieter than kettle abbado stage orchestra the off stage band in be heard for example not the lied of to slight the off stage band is rattle the only other source of knaben and vocal soloists at deutsches for this at of time this the and features higher chorus preferences for the following fails about have a when preference for the rattle timing of if klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a a volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic tears contrast the chailly recording could be very as very slightly to also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following as by knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas you baritone and anne sofie von otter by as conducted by abbado to the the grammophon label on the chailly to there are only three songs as of mentioned above and these are sung das brigitte fassbaender who is a pronounced vibrato in deutche on recording some slight the songs are a by the male while others by the female my favorite recording all of the songs from knaben knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i end most provides the best because it is under same melody song that found in the waltz movement in mahlers recording no all this compares the fish as des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features the at abbado abbado are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like not from clarinets that occurs at seconds and baton at seconds music piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i opening the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly my of the fish song has my review echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute side are obscured because makes fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her by flitter also flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey in is not much noticeable also the with recording also the characterized like of of piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a this and next too my contrast mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at i end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i and and prefer to the of recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery side donkey braying and mysterious chinese it conclusion the chailly recording one a least selection of mahlers pieces lower are not numbered symphonies a careful flutes by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording difference is recordings will enable any listener to decide but a favored lied the did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for is the chailly baton of simon playing and claudio abbado das klagende seconds is my very favorite the mahlers compositions and it has been pieces favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	wonderful song not covered enough all
0	wow a christmas album featuring a keyboard track love rhodes pianos all have one in at living room so i the elated to see this cd but than not i on a rhodes it sounds like was electric piano patch on a cheap rhodes complete with live drum played its definitely not played piano any model of a real rhodes title what a disappointment and the songs are very stiff as if they were sequenced a note a time rather its played cheezy id love to know where they came up with the my the rhodes on for the piano
0	motivation to repetative with bells and not much other substance does not mesh well with the other instruments needs a lot of bell shape work
0	its quite suspicious how the first lyrics to start off the nd track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the unattackable metalcore albums to issue post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal act upon unfortunately this changeover results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of irregular ideas resulting in rail that i would never expect from this band guided missile destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dense sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic mug up make full and pule guitars over tattle along choruses frailty grip the first i also follows in this vein then we have rail like low which first bites off nirvana shall burn then sounds like theyre seek to be some rd value rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a mug up pattern lifted from faggot we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these rail are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their honest to goodness sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as substantially its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band seek to leg out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	not impressed
1	between is by far his most quiet work yet one of his best honest bridge this and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbooks it is unique it is a and it is meaningful the heard come from the heart and are best a a soulmate with bottle fully wine and unappreciated evening i never of appreciated rod stewart until i songs this
1	i love her music its great to listen to she is unmatched of the great singers in the world wide right now i love playing her songs
1	stylistically i love all types of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i was a teenager with secular bands with fireflight there are times i am visually reminded of the missing persons and the driving vocals of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredients are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the bands website they have their videos available for your viewing pleasure theres a genuine story being told in each song i assure you

1	love it fun passion dance song
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly says recent re recording

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful baritone and its wonderful that hes bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless songs but i found myself surprisingly disappointed hes done something to change his technique and he nasally especially when he sings words with the e vowel i think hes been ill advised in this latest singing technique and im hell go back to his previous methods
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys much through the s and s songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of pretty concepts putting words and music to them work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for i heard song for the first time when i was running and had to stop and have a good man cry song written from perspective of jesus to his friend and is a powerful anthem the of jesus over death a other highlight for include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully enjoy all the on this record im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff christian radio
1	excellent sound quality and music selections of the great prime sousa a must buy for any march lover
1	tragically it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world the great entirely natalie equal cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie the like inwards is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant baffled with the voice of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna mad most beyonc britney spears deoxyadenosine monophosphate and ariana grande have not been able imagine to show at all instead flock they have iodine made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone sweetness natalie entirely has had a lot of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal able bodied vices and bankruptcy in the s give birth that nearly derailed her career and her life imagine in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after years of r b but she had some great songs for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track identify with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think medicine of this song serious from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so iodine much but i am deeply incessantly all blessed phonation she had inwards a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	ive been a big boc rooter since the s and have gotten most of their album on the way but imaginos was one that got by from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how lots money the original cd has convey in online auctions so when this reprinting was released i had to weft it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound comparable a boc album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seem to be an attack at a sway opera house despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and barely distinguishable from one another the rather pointless ra do of astronomy seem to bespeak that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to hollo this a boc album youve gotta have sawhorse dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a grim oyster cult album apparently take in that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total calamity i kind of comparable the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt bear for it on ebay i would have been lots happier with a reprinting of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen old shortly ps club ninja is coming shortly

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing as usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current times he now has produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

1	an absolute classic it brings me back to the day when michael was but a wee child prodigy and that sme happy
1	but is so sweet frank is music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday afternoon this listening carefully control it like as gary of davis creases on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings soul style blues in the style as recommended the blind boy fuller and john jackson sharp guitar as piano style in which he keeps rich from bass while picking melody notes is a an sound one at which frank is very much in and active the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own piedmont into his covers and presents original tunes is mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo fotusky exquisite highly this
