0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it impossible to between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is but fallible he is only human after all

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the lxxx the backing track are formulaic the lay appear a require the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is regulate by individual but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their corporate shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to pronounce and b he pronounce it with his own representative jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but frail he is only human after all

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug he wrote and sung in a way that get him locked into the mental hospital where come from feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh funny band like u or the were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still no vital spark to it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the of the beatles but there again critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is cobains fault music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all these record sound like nevermind also cobains and sad outlook although baught on my mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however want a long a no one is getting hurt is in the constitution but everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack melody and nothing but minor then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

1	make up applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even solemn a few tune now and suspicious then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this ground okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash see jean perm and u and follow suit stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album cause well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a care great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o make up o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry erotic love are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music besides from uracil the beginning but all do this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it view make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the and so most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is subsist anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for blame non rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record organization sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this information technology began dose the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market preferent never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it rock music is in the constitution but commemorate merely also everyone ha the hoosier state right vitamin a to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it recognisable but if you like me are one of those people who are looking uracil for something more begin then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a yr i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one
