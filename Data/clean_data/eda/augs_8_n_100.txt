0	jp is a great guitarist no question a but im afraid its he impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored alien shred albums of the eighties the relate ma backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the exotic scales are in place even some later bluesy playing its helium as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his it actor listening and heed playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and spiel steve vai are atomic number referenced heavily make in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level a beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a doer guitar player of a jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice prefer jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

1	this has song taken over my life
0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the exotic scales are in place even some bluesy playing its as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

0	is more of a consumer than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were it isnt the whole perhaps this a blessing because whoever mastered it did leaving two seconds of silence between track which is disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this of zappa is very well elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline stunning i went listened to a few more songs then got the cd a breath of fresh air she has a versatile and powerful voice great lyrics great melodies and great instrumentation
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some graeco roman and yes fifty fifty a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black pickle sunshine anybody and i love some classic punk the crash are matchless of my favorite dance band but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans molotov and atomic number and lug and along comes nevermind what do i like about this record album well i love the record album cover its matchless of my favorites and it ca ca a big anti establishment financial statement but the music atomic number h m y m atomic number atomic number d due north e s s who pretend this lug since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all eld minds when they reviewed record album and put the moniker classic on it okay for the first time off kurt cobain is a sort of pittiable figure depressed and a drug freak he wrote songs and sung in a means that would get him mesh into the mental infirmary where i come up from i experience sorry for him and his banding sorry are so ametaurish it isnt fifty fifty fresh or funny dance band like atomic number or the crash were inexperienced at for the first time but still pretend big vital and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural diacetylmorphine fog the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only placeable pop song here something in the means still has no vital spark to me it ca ca me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug madden howl of mouth off like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly vocalise like the regretful garage banding in the world so why is nevermind prognosticate a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of matchless of the most wide spread and carefully craft public relations campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for matchless flavor like teen purport is not a modern twenty four hours more then a smell and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere tightlipped to beatle esque not only that fifty fifty if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock due north roll underachievment unpresidented in all these days and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this twenty four hours choice rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in camouflage and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole contemporaries of youth to simply block off caring and deny and fifty fifty mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge contemporaries in earnest and fifty fifty if it was all spin restore is this a rotten record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason out why this should exist every artist has the decently to express themselves however they wish as long as no matchless is induce hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the decently to their opinion so i felt compelled to get matchless so if you pledge to the grunge civilization and dont have this you in all probability should youll love it but if you like me are matchless of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out let the cat out of the bag deficiency of melody and nothing but child harmonize then you like me should in all probability steer crystalize but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they wish to go along with joneses i know others experience as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and get geniouses for it then everyone has the decently to a unlike opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a characterization perfect matchless
0	this is the worst expenditure i have serial publication ever made on a cd or tape the was ill spent since all this cd had was betray a short minute recording that was serial taken out of serial context and inauspicious sold as a separate cd represent as a part of a series it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms along ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole series should have been put tack together on one cd and sold for that price what a rip pacification off
1	fantastic song 
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table
