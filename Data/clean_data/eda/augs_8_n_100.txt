0	i love the cd the i case for it that in the mail and the am very mad about broke
0	jp is a bully guitar player no question but im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his pen and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the lay appear a expected the alien musical scale are in place yet some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the subservient album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to get it to the adjacent level beyond their collective shadow a former armed force a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand bank note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to accomplish this here in sum up jp is awesome but imperfect he only man after all
