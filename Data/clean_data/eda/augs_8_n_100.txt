0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are ane of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this immortalize came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean permanent and uranium and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this record album well i love the record album cover it ane of my favorite and it shit a large anti establishment statement but the music o total heat m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call scripted sometimes i wonder what give way through rock critic of all age heed when they reviewed album and place the soubriquet classic on it okay first of all off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug freak he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like uranium or the clash were inexperienced at first of all but still made large zippy and sinewy music from the get but all this end up is a an aural diacetylmorphine fog the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it shit me tempestuous that an plain sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug half crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of ane of the most encompassing spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for ane smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new immortalize for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental trouble inadverantly do a whole generation of youth to simply stop lovingness and deny and even mock the more positive element of their by so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy immortalize technically very much should it be stripped from the mart never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no ane is getting hurt it in the establishment but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get ane so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are ane of those mass who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor harmonise then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a put down like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect ane

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter nigh mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team mike is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a lop typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the blank space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording ism of dally it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it noting new coming from dgg if one rightfully want to savor a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living comportment or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid it to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

0	if you know me i listen to a camouflage vast spectrum of music from some classical world health organization and yes even a few tune now and then formation from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but shove this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the be day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and follow along come nevermind what do i like indicate about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o or so d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album care and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him genial and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like u or the follow clash were inexperienced at first but still made question great lively and powerful music group o from the le beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze reciprocal ohm the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing belike u to throw endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind atomic number called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the mean solar day day of the love beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if along it not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on chef doeuvre my his mental problem inadverantly caused a choice whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive kod element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and only thats the only reason mental picture why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want shut up a long a no one is getting hurt it in the financial statement constitution but also everyone ha antiophthalmic factor the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had soh to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and antiophthalmic factor become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always jar have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a spectrum of music from some and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and outlook although on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny even mock the more positive element of their so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i to hear it to have an opinion my main is not every rock should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

1	composer is included in the file information this is baroque so it going to sound well baroque of course there are going to be some you arent thrilled with but fall on it for all of them
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no uncle tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and uncle tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and fit in to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each pas over which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa book of ruth underwood uncle tom fowler napoleon murphy brock saint george duke and chester count rumford this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an total concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by but fails to take it to the next beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one a thousand so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly follow antiophthalmic factor recorded live gig allow from a large auditorium probably antiophthalmic factor to cassette and according to those who were there it follow isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth world health organization underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock follow george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which on that point is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table
0	ain i think hasselvander writes his own review this is not worth buying painful to listen to make you want to give him lesson
0	if you recognise me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite stripe but this okay for starter i remember when this record come out i wa still in the sidereal day of acid wash jean perm and uracil and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a corking anti establishment statement but the music o h m y gib o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly phone written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all senesce mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a dose addict he compose song and song in a way that would receive him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny stripe like uracil or the clash were inexperient at first but still made corking lively and powerful music from the first but all this cease up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact live on forcing u to endure his unhearable dose crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite image themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide disperse and carefully crafted pr campaign since the sidereal day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles cease for one smell like teen spirit is not a forward looking day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains error his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely cured from to this day option rock radio tends to be more or to a lesser extent grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains misanthropical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this receive the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all tailspin doctored is this a shitty record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should live every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is pay off hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to receive one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those the great unwashed who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i recognise others feel a i do if nirvana could hit a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	received wrong cd !
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah . neither of those girl know how to sing , you used to . i want my ol marie back , till then i will be using this cd a a coaster , while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older album . btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride . thanks alot !
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	great !
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the .mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	great
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	fantastic song .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	sweet song and great lyric !
1	love !
1	great album i love it
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for a secret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother . if you are under 13 and female , you will just love it . i saw jewel in concert four time last year ( 2002 ) . if/when she tour this year ( 2003 ) , i sure will not be in attendance . i can not possibly be the only fan that feel cheated with the release of this cd . how , in good conscience , can she record/release a cd like this ? ! ? ! the fan base that she ha diligently built over the year is in serious danger of ruin . speak out against this abominable cd . i know you are out there , i can not be alone on this .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	not a great a i had hoped
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	great song
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	the best
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting . there are no band credit on the sleeve but , for the record , they are zappa , ruth underwood , tom fowler , napoleon murphy brock , george duke , and chester thompson . this era of zappa/mothers is very well covered elsewhere . the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded . this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table .
0	so so
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	this song ha taken over my life
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	great song
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	love it
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	lame
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	what can you say lyle is lyle
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	great old song
1	great song !
0	poor audio quality .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
