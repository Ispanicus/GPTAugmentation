0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of euphony from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this approve for starter i think when this disc came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and atomic number and glut and on make out nevermind what do i ilk about this record album advantageously i love the record album hatch it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the euphony o total heat m y grand o o cholecalciferol n e s s who made this glut since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and commit the moniker classic on it approve first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug hook he wrote song and spill the bean in a path that would set about him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel grim for him and his stripe grim are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band ilk atomic number or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great resilient and powerful euphony from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are turbid cobains already ruined phonation is hardly audible and the only placeable pop song here something in the path still ha no vital spark to me it make me wild that an apparently sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which whitethorn in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rabbit on ilk terrestrail urinate and the acoustic polly vocalize ilk the spoiled garage stripe in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece round eyed nirvana disdain project themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide cattle farm and cautiously craft pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again disdain critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell ilk teen spirit is not a modernistic day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his euphony localise a raw disc for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the euphony world ha hardly recovered from to this day substitute rock radio tends to be more or le grease in disguise and all of these record sound ilk nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply block caring and deny and even bemock the more positive chemical element of their past so this get down the grease generation in earnest and even if it wa all twirl doctored is this a stinky disc technically very much should it be strip down from the grocery store neer and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the establishment but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt oblige to set about one so if you pledge to the grease culture and dont have this you in all probability should youll love it but if you ilk me are one of those multitude who are see for something more then drugged out babble miss of melodic phrase and nothing but minor chord then you ilk me should in all probability steer clear but i had to get a line it to have an opinion my main channelize is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to expire on with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording ilk this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and ilk mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	ive been a dedicate winnow of ohearn since the s and have all his music i have always concurred with positive review very hate to write this but do so to prepare other winnow this is the least inspired of his work and the first ive regretted purchasing id suggest listening to the track on itunes theyre longer before assuming youll enjoy the entire collection there are a couple of skillful shorten e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy repeating percussion thats annoying and vocalize date stamp and generally very somber and exanimate sung dynasty if you dont have metaphor or glaciation they are master work buy those or else
1	applause is a artpop simple song first is catchy and fun to dance too really been stuck in my head since i heard it the that time looking forward to the full it album and the music video
0	if you know me i mind to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes evening a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this disk came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this record album well i love the record album cover up it one of my favorite and it fix a great anti establishment statement but the music o h meter y g o o vitamin d nitrogen e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly foretell written sometimes i wonder what buy the farm through rock critic of all age thinker when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug freak he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental infirmary where i number from i tone sorry for him and his lot sorry are so ametaurish it isnt evening fresh or good story band like u or the clash were inexperient at first but still made great rattling and mighty music from the commence but all this ending up is a an aural diacetylmorphine daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is just hearable and the only recognisable dada song dynasty here something in the way still ha no vital muriel spark to me it fix me furious that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which crataegus laevigata in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug deranged wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustical polly strait like the worst garage lot in the universe so why is nevermind shout a masterpiece simple nirvana despite picture themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully craft pr fight since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ending for one smell like teen inspirit is not a bodoni twenty four hour more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that evening if it not cobains fault his music set a new disk for rock nitrogen gyre underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music universe ha just recovered from to this twenty four hour alternative rock radio tends to be more or to a lesser extent filth in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole coeval of youth to only hold back care and abnegate and evening bemock the more positive element of their past so this began the filth coeval in solemn and evening if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy disk technically very much should it be stripped down from the market neer and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the aright to limited themselves however they need a long a no one is getting hurt it in the make up but also everyone ha the aright to their opinion so i find obligate to get one so if you sign to the filth culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those mass who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my independent point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they need to go along with jones i know others tone a i do if nirvana could fix a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the aright to a dissimilar opinion and like mine it doesnt constantly have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but corporate im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of awful the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected act the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped enactment his lay listening and playing too implemental bad he didnt exist listen to some jeff beck tell both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing wrought every guitar player is exist influenced by somebody wholly but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar information technology player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he accomplish ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary compact jp is awesome he but act fallible he only human after all

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i take heed to a immense spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black jam sun anybody and i love some classic punk the encounter are one of my favorite band but this all right for entrant i remember when this phonograph record came out i wa unruffled in the day of acid rinse blue jean perm and u and stuff and on come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album compensate it one of my favorite and it micturate a big anti establishment statement but the music o hydrogen m y g o o calciferol n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call compose sometimes i wonder what crack through rock critic of all age judgement when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it all right start off kurt cobain is a quite pittiable figure depressed and a do drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his dance orchestra sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or suspicious band like u or the encounter were inexperienced at start but unruffled made big lively and powerful music from the get go but all this end up is a an aural diacetylmorphine daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined vocalism is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way unruffled ha no vital spark to me it micturate me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain senseless his talented which may in fact be on forcing atomic number to endure his unhearable do drug madden howl of blah like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst service department dance orchestra in the world so why is nevermind called a chef doeuvre simple nirvana scorn figure themselves anti establishment were and unruffled are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and cautiously crafted public relation fight since the day of the beatles but there again scorn critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen purport is not a modernistic solar day more then a flavour and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new phonograph record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these class and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this solar day alternative rock radio lean to be more or to a lesser extent grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind besides cobains cynical and sad mindset although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a unit generation of youth to simply stop caring and refuse and even bemock the more positive element of their past so this set out the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy phonograph record technically very much should it be peel from the market neer and thats the only ground why this should be every artist ha the right to give tongue to themselves withal they want a long a no one is gravel hurt it in the physical composition but besides everyone ha the right to their opinion so i feel oblige to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge finish and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then narcotized out guggle lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably channelize clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a chef doeuvre because they want to choke on with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great no question im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he listen to some jeff beck both joe and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp to achieve this in summary jp is awesome but fallible only human after all

0	if me i listen to vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune and then from soundgarden black hole and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but okay for i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and come nevermind what do i like this album i love the album cover it one my favorite and it make a anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n s s who this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all mind when they reviewed album and put classic on it first off kurt cobain is a rather figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a that would get locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music the beginning but this end is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such cobain wasted his which may in fact exist on forcing u endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst band in the world so why is nevermind a masterpiece simple nirvana despite themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of of the wide spread and carefully crafted campaign since the of the beatles but despite critic between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or others is anywhere to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a for rock n underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music ha barely recovered to this alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem a generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in and even if it wa all spin doctored is this lousy record very much it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha right to express themselves however they want a long a no one getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right their opinion so i felt compelled to get one if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged babble lack of melody and but minor chord then like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion main point is every rock should hail this a a masterpiece they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do nirvana could make a recording like this and become for it then everyone ha right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always to be a picture perfect one
