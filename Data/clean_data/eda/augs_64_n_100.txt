0	jp is a groovy guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this record album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred record album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the lay appear a expected the alien scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is strain to emulate the instrumental record album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by individual but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective phantasma a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thou note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own vocalisation jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he is only human after all

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some authoritative and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i retrieve when this record came out i wa still in the clarence day of acid slipstream jean permanent and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it piddle a great anti establishment statement but the music type o h m y g type o type o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly telephone call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all maturate mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel blue for him and his band blue are so ametaurish it is not even new or funny band like u or the clash were inexperient at first but still made great springy and powerful music from the commencement but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is just audible and the only recognizable protrude song here something in the way still hour angle no lively spark to me it piddle me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to hold up his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece elementary paradise disdain fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide cut ranch and carefully craft porto rico campaign since the clarence day of the beatles but there again disdain critic is where the comparasin between paradise and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern clarence day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n bowl underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world hour angle just recovered from to this clarence day alternate rock radio receiver tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this lead off the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist hour angle the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone hour angle the right to their opinion so i felt oblige to get one so if you support to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then narcotized out babble lack of melody and nothing but kid chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if paradise could piddle a register like this and become geniouses for it then everyone hour angle the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development be thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is level zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that be the sound collapse into enter itself with the audible consequence of a beryllium sever be typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new modern coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca operating room living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

1	great album i love it
1	it be is an mp download product is exactly what wa advertised not much more to say about it you either like him or you do not
0	if you know me i listen to a immense spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i washington still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i wish about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly predict indite sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first class honour degree off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable flesh dispirit and a drug hook he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band wish u or the clash were inexperient at first class honour degree but still made great lively and herculean music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin dazzle the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital discharge to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his gifted which may in fact exist on storm u to endure his unhearable drug crazed wailing of rant wish terrestrail pissing and the acoustical polly strait wish the uncollectible garage band in the world so why is nevermind holler a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell wish teen spirit is not a modern day more then a flavour and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely cured from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in mask and all of these record strait wish nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole contemporary of youth to simply contain caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge contemporary in earnest and even if it washington all reel doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be uncase from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every creative person ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the physical composition but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i matte compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge civilisation and do not have this you plausibly should you will love it but if you wish me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you wish me should plausibly steer clear but i had to get wind it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should herald this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording wish this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a dissimilar opinion and wish mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of medicine from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clangour are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid lavation jean molotov and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the medicine o h m y g o o d due north e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly scream written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all eld mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable flesh depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental infirmary where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or fishy band like u or the clangour were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and brawny medicine from the set out but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already undone phonation is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital arc to me it make me angry that an evidently sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his gifted which may in fact exist on pull u to wear his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and cautiously craft pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen feel is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his medicine fixed a novel record for rock due north roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the medicine world ha barely retrieve from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains misanthropical and sad mentality although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole propagation of younker to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive component of their past so this began the grunge propagation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to verbalize themselves however they want a long a no one is have hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to discover it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a put down like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a dissimilar opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a refresh do not touch this four hundred firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio circulate it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each chase after which is very disconcerting there are no band quotation on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler bonaparte murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this epoch of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to shore up up a wobbly table
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection all are excellent some are definitive however it is time world wide released the record album contained in the set separately so one is not forced to pay almost just to get a performance of bolero they could also do the same for other high priced collection like ernest ansermet decca recording it is also time that the major label gave up trying to effect u to buy an entire record album for the saki of one or two cut

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each which is very disconcerting are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere second of is an entire concert by this band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he is only human after all

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who entirely hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the open up phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a marvellous orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg contraction that move the entirely sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild game from where the sonic action wa a few second agone this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play game system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play game variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hired hand it is noting new coming from dgg if unity really want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let unity turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred guitar player album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is trying to payoff emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not playacting listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps angstrom unit playing no bad thing whatsoever every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their enjoin collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of seek jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long angstrom unit a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome along but fallible he is only human after all

0	arkansas is the backside filler of single capitol where the playground susie hit the rest of the album is period album filler for whatever inexplicable reason capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before rhinestone cowboy capitol sw lp release considering that gc monster song at the time rhinestone cowboy capitol single record wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track the label mightve given the marketing a green light to put out something anything out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time
0	my year onetime grandson is possessed with this song he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one amazon could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version
1	not his most favorite but love his music so vocal it is a very good song to me
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and and along come what do i like about this album well i love the cover it is one my favorite and it make a great anti establishment but the music o h m y g o o n e s s made this since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug he wrote song and sung in a way that get him locked the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only pop song here something the way still ha no spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is cobains fault his music set a new for n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and outlook although baught my mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor then you like me should steer clear but i had hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a masterpiece because they want go along with jones i know others feel a i do nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be picture perfect one
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the and have all his euphony i have always concurred with positive review really hate to write this but do so to prepare other fan this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection there are a couple of nice cut e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy repeating pleximetry that is annoying and wakeless dated and generally very melancholy and exanimate song if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work buy those instead

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not extend to this cd firstly there is no tom hold back apparently the band played deuce gig this night and tom hold back join them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving deuce second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the arm but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester benjamin thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an stallion concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this single should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	sound like sam sparros black and heavy gold but not a good the beat is annoying heavy and the wailing at the associate in nursing end is incongruous in an electronic song like this i thought he wa a rocker an image he portrayed on idol and this is far from rock not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before
0	i test to sleep while listing this tape but it is more annoying than soothing some people may still like it but i definitely did not enjoy it

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is cover impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of amazing the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it ar is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too nobelium bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to record album take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice hoosier state jp fails to achieve ar this here in summary jp is awesome but ma fallible angstrom unit he is only human after all
1	love this album heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately and i wa not disappointed it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to enounce if you slam bonnie you can not go legal injury with this album

0	if you know me i hear to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden fatal hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the collide are one and only of my ducky band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one and only of my ducky and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o atomic number m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call spell sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a instead pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would stick him lock away into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the collide were inexperienced at first but still made great springy and powerful music from the beginning but all this ending up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only placeable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital arc to me it make me angry that an evidently sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to support his unhearable drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail relieve oneself and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite visualize themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one and only of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles death for one and only smell like teen spirit is not a forward looking day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace stuffy to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock tuner tends to be more or le grunge in camouflage and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly induce a all generation of youth to simply contain caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every creative person ha the right to verbalize themselves however they want a long a no one and only is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to stick one and only so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you in all probability should you will love it but if you like me are one and only of those mass who are looking for something more then narcotised out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should in all probability steer decipherable but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a unlike opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one and only

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is at that place of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a be poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it enter is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record dance band they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy and then endorsement bulk brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	if you bed me i hear to a vast spectrum of music from some hellenic and yes still a few strain now and then from soundgarden black mess sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this memorialize came out i wa still in the twenty four hour of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this record album well i love the record album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music group o h m atomic number gib group o group o d n vitamin e s s who made this stuff since i could scarcely call scripted sometimes i wonder what go through sway critic of all age mind when they reviewed record album and set the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he write song and sung in a path that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not still fresh or laughable band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the path still ha no vital spark to me it make me tempestuous that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which whitethorn in fact be on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed bawling of blah like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a chef doeuvre simple nirvana despite envision themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr drive since the twenty four hour of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern twenty four hour more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that still if it is not cobains fault his music set a new memorialize for sway n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this twenty four hour alternative sway radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these memorialize sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop care and deny and still mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and still if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy memorialize technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reasonableness why this should be every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is arrest hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out guggle lack of air and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main bespeak is not every sway critic should hail this a a chef doeuvre because they want to go along with jones i bed others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a dissimilar opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd first there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the mo this transcription is of the kickoff nor is it a radio air it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two mo of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the immortalise they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon i murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the mo volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly tabularise
0	is this an april fool day joke i ask that because this wa only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub par vocal are simply awful here david lee roth wa never a great singer though he wa a great frontman in the studio and with song that matched his vocal style he could be good so paired with a great sounding band and that is why i give this album star he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more do not get me wrong i do love a lot of van halens material of the roth and haggar era but this is just not that great
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year i recall correctly it wa one of the track a promotional best wild cd that came with an early discman my father it arose again power recently when i started up on arrested development and it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob now it is my ringtone fun stuff

0	is this an april fool day joke i ask that because this wa only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub par vocal are simply awful here jacques louis david lee roth wa never a bang up singer though he wa a bang up frontman in the studio and with song that pair his vocal style he could be pretty good so paired with a bang up vocalize band and that is why i give this album star he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more do not have me wrong i do love a lot of van halens material of both the roth and haggar era but this is just not that bang up
1	lyric instrumentals are incredible you can not listen to this on low crank it up in your car and get blood flowing
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some multiplication classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some record album classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it freak is one of my favorite confidential information and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o vocal d n e s s who made this euphony stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go carry through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into along the mental cipher hospital draw where credibly i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were information technology inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are misanthropic cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail globe pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a angstrom unit masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day non of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the geological fault comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere likewise close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not impression cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music making love world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more longsighted wounded or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my just his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even be if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get retiring one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably platter should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail wherefore this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do be if nirvana could start make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone non ha the right to a different opinion and like cipher mine it doe not injure always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored album of the eighty the backing track formulaic the ballad a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve here in summary jp is awesome fallible is only human all

0	if you know me i take heed to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my preferred striation but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acerbic wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album considerably i love the album hide it is one of my preferred and it fix a great anti establishment program line but the music o atomic number yard y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could just call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay low off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the genial hospital where i come from i feel no good for him and his striation no good are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny striation like u or the clash were inexperienced at low but still made great live and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are nebulous cobains already ruined vocalisation is barely audible and the only recognisable soda water song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it fix me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed mewl of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage striation in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one spirit like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feel and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his genial problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop wish and abnegate and even bemock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in solemn and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be foray from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they wish a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the fundamental law but also everyone ha the right to their popular opinion so i felt obligate to get one so if you support to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer earn but i had to hear it to have an popular opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they wish to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could fix a register like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different popular opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	this is the worst using up i have eer made on a cd or tape the wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a parting of a series it is evidently a recording of a meeting m ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole series should have been set up on one cd and sold for that price what a rip off
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

1	great harmony super fourties mathematical group group
0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is work impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing work on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player altogether is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to angstrom unit the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps subservient calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a hither a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve helium this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he is cover cover only human after all

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the ontogeny thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a fantastic orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever distinctive dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a soft back from where the transonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of transonic distortion but on the other hand it is noting raw coming from dgg if unmatched truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity lashkar e toiba unmatched turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	towards the middle end of the song barbra streisand look part seems quite screechy to me sad a this is a great song i am surprised it passed anyones approval
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch non this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played along two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is be a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler be napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by get together this nimble band which airscrew is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	i have been a fan of ohearn since the and have all his music i have always concurred with positive review really hate to write this but do so to prepare other fan this is the inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection there are couple of nice cut e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy repeating percussion that is and sound dated and generally very somber and lifeless song if you do not have metaphor or they are work buy those instead
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven th i expect they recall the choral segment this min sec bit of the th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece that said this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good

0	partake endorsement this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd hold back firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band be played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did be so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the be second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only wellspring be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the and have all his music i have always concurred with positive review really hate to write this but do constantly save so to prepare other fan this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming keep open you will enjoy the entire collection there vocal are a couple of nice cut e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy repeating percussion that is annoying take and sound dated and generally very somber and lifeless song if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work buy those instead

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do shaky not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the bash band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live be gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth information technology underwood tom fowler result napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by associate in nursing this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only along be at that place used to prop up a wobbly table

0	is this an april fool day joke i ask that because this washington only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub par vocal are simply awful here david lee side roth washington never a bully singer though he washington a bully frontman in the studio and with song that matched his vocal style he could be pretty good so paired with a bully sounding stria and that is why i give this album star he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stomach out more do not get me wrong i do love a lot of van halens material of both the roth and haggar era but this is just not that bully
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and non yes even a level few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record commit came out i wa still in the day of acid non wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do emaciated i like about this album well start i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make payoff a and then great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a sanction take rather pittiable figure information technology depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at non first but still made great lively and powerful music from agency the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible factor and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still job ha no vital spark to me it make me angry shine that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly similar sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but impression there again despite critic is more or le where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is complete not cobains fault his music set a new record for just rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be agency more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole angstrom unit generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the political campaign and then more positive element of their past impression so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically multiplication very much should john rock it be stripped from the market save never and that is the only smooth reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should dearie probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my clangoring main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to be go along with jones i know others save feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses paradise for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the enter sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very along center of aberrance the space and pull it a mild initiative back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and hinder below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new coming from take dgg if one upward truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity attract let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up process a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a you got in state of trance you will be disappointed entire album if very melodic but not edgy at all i am sorry to say this but if i had to categorize it i would have to say gay trance it wa hard to listen to the whole thing i kept hoping it would get better but it just kept disappointing honestly i say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again once wa torture enough it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap hop though which is why gave it star instead

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this for starter i when this record came out i wa in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s who made this stuff since i could hardly call sometimes i what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on okay first off kurt cobain is a pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in way that would get him locked the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant terrestrail and the acoustic sound like the worst garage band in the world so why called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that if it is not cobains fault music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day radio tends to be more or le grunge in and all these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i to one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out lack of and nothing but minor chord then you like me probably clear but had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be picture perfect one
1	this song hour angle taken over my life
0	of all the broadway show i haver always heard or and seen this one is by far one of the top ten worst the birdcall are laughable awful more gossip about this terrible cd is senseless the reason i am writing this gossip is merely to give you one simple tip do not waste your money on it compared to this flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece

1	majuscule great song
0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear information technology a expected the exotic scale do are in place even some bluesy playing it compact is a shop at if jp angstrom unit is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are aside lay referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he just fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am former armed force concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he is only human after all

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd first there is no tom wait apparently the set played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this register is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a gravid auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no set credit on the arm but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom henry watson fowler napoleon tater brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble set which is beautifully recorded this one should only be apply to prop up a wobbly table

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no credit on the sleeve but for the they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the volume of ycdtosa is an entire by this nimble band is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table
