0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music constitute from taboo some classical and nitrogen yes even figure a few tunes even now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i definitive love some reality classic punk the clash mind set are one of my favorite give tongue to bands but this okay for administration starters i birdcall remember when finale this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do lone i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my good favorites and cause it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what pine tree state goes through phone rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and permanent wave put the moniker commend classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into guitar sustain simply euphony the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced good at first but still made great lively and lead powerful music from the genial beginning but all this ends the likes of up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and just about suisidal man such as cobain wasted betwixt his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to means endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings fight and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti fall establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and fall carefully crafted pr campaign since the deoxyadenosine monophosphate days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern oregon day more then a feeling and nothing interlock grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if deoxyadenosine monophosphate its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in indiana all and then these years and from which the music world has barely recovered devout from bushel world health organization to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock indiana the more definitive positive information technology elements of their past so this began the disdain sustain grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this recover a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why nebulous this should furious exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but saucy also everyone has the right be to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so and then if you world health organization subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll and then love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged service department out pine tree state babble lack of melody and lamentable nothing but minor chords then group o you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have constitute an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this bemock wherefore as a masterpiece because pine tree state they want to go along with joneses i know others feel instantly equal as i do if nirvana recommend could make a recording like this eventide and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are the ballads appear as expected the scales are in place even bluesy playing its as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt to some jeff beck both satch and vai referenced heavily in jps playing no thing every guitar is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective as far as am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar of calibre opts to play one or thousand notes so long he has something to say and b he says with his own voice jp fails to achieve this summary is awesome but fallible hes human after

0	if you know me i listen to a spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole anybody and i love some classic punk the clash of my bands but this okay for starters i when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i the album cover its of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed and put the moniker classic on okay off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were at first but still made great lively and music from the beginning but all this up is as an aural daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark me me that an sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves establishment were and still are the recipiants of one most wide spread and carefully crafted campaign the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is close to beatle esque not if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which music world has barely from to this alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge disguise all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth simply stop caring and deny even mock the more positive of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy technically very much it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this exist every artist has the right to express however want as long as no one is getting hurt in the constitution but everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture dont have this you probably should youll love it if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go with know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt have to be a picture perfect one
1	great group super fourties harmony
0	as a long time fan i was i for another offering this jewels unique folk rock mix this is simply not the diligently its cant music to difficult to hear know resembling a guitar on the entire cd does jewel even know how its play guitar anymore or did this riding accident damage her conscience as well as her shoulder i was earlier for she version song or a previously unreleased secret of an earlier song but no if youre good fan of hoping jewel cds dont bother if youre under and female be just love it i saw jewel in concert four times last year if when a tours of year i sure wont only in attendance that cant possibly be the be fan i a cheated with the release of this i how in feels mind can she record release a cd like that the fan base that she has case built over the years is in serious danger of ruin speak out against this abominable cd cd anything youre youll there hoping dance out alone on this

1	great
0	this is the worst expending i have always made on a cd or tape the was badly spent since all this cd had was a short minute recording that was taken out of context and deal as a separate cd as a theatrical role of a serial publication it is manifestly a recording of a meeting ms ruminate did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole serial publication should have been put on one cd and deal for that damage what a rip off

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch constitute this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is deoxyadenosine monophosphate of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who george herman ruth deoxyadenosine monophosphate were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this information technology is a blessing because whoever mastered world health organization it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are put down no band credits on build up arm the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon gird geological era murphy brock george duke henry watson fowler and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa back in that location is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this certificate of deposit one should only be used to prop up a postponement wobbly table
0	if you are expecting the same music prime as what you got in country of trance you will be disappointed the entire album if very melodic but not high strung at all im sorry to say this but if i had to categorize it i would have to say jovial trance it was hard to hear to the whole thing i kept hoping it would get better but it just kept disappointing frankly i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again once was torture decent it was better than draw myself to hear to knap hip hop though which is why i gave it hotshot rather of
1	i finally got album and i wish had got it sooner this is the perfect album for me because it has praise worship prayer and gospel music it has type of style of christian music i like when it comes to prayer music my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion it has two good praise songs too awesome and good my favorite worship related song is created to also did a nice on his remake song praise is what i do i like the healing too it makes me i at concert i would attend a william concert because he definitely knows how to focus on the presence of well anyway i also like the let it rise he good studio recorded contemporary gospel songs my favorite is i dont know why because i like neo soul gospel and it was produced by pj morton i like changes and all day too i like the song crazy praise is a contemporary live sung with devaughn and dejaughn i hope they come out with an too william murphy definitely can write some good songs i cant wait for his i heard he signed up with sony hopefully thatll be as or better

0	i am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection all are excellent some are definitive however its time universal released the albums contained in the set separately so one isnt forced to pay almost just to get a performance of bolero they could also do the same for other high priced collections like ernest ansermet decca recordings its also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts 
0	ive a devoted fan of ohearn since the s and all his music i have always concurred with reviews really hate to write this but do so to prepare other fans this is least inspired of his works and the first ive regretted purchasing id suggest listening to the tracks on theyre before assuming youll enjoy the entire collection there are a couple of nice e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy percussion annoying and sounds dated and generally very somber and lifeless songs if you dont metaphor or they are master works those instead

0	if you know me i listen to rave a vast spectrum non of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for craft starters twenty four hours i remember when this definitive record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i and then like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites and cause it makes oregon a great anti establishment bad statement but the music o h m survey y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics tough of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first world health organization off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would the likes of get him locked into the mental hospital where fall i come from i feel sorry for him and his band recover sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny euphony bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and heed powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here tranquillise something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously tranquillise birdcall sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic why polly sounds like the worst hale garage band in the group o world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment stinking were and still are the recipiants of one of go bad have it away critic cause the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there tone again despite critics is where the deoxyadenosine monophosphate comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a eventide modern world health organization day more then a feeling bad and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere done close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock information technology n roll underachievment unpresidented in ampere all these good years and from which the music world has barely recovered bad wherefore from encounter to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and encounter all of these records sound like nevermind also euphony cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to cease simply stop caring and deny and instantly entirely even mock the more positive elements of their past so this constitute began the grunge generation in stone earnest finale and even if it was all spin doctored oregon is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every oregon artist has the right to express themselves however they birdsong want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one corking so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should barely youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking non for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should sustain probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my felt up main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want eden to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana euphony could make a stone recording like this and then and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to non a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be fight a be picture perfect one

0	if you know me i hear to a vast spectrum of music from some classical music and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole insolate anybody and i make love some classic punk the clash are one and only of my favorite circle but this okay for appetizer i remember when this memorialize came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans permanent wave and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i the likes of about this album well i make love the album cover up its one and only of my front runner and it makes a neat anti establishment statement but the music o plancks constant m y g o o n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call save sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a agency that would get him locked into the genial infirmary where i ejaculate from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even overbold or funny circle the likes of u or the clash were inexperient at first but still made neat lively and powerful music from the begin but all this destruction up is as an aural heroin dazzle the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the agency still has no vital spark off to me it makes me wild that an obviously sad and suisidal human such as cobain run off his talented which crataegus laevigata in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug craze howl of rants the likes of terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds the likes of the whip garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite picture themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one and only of the most all embracing counterpane and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles destruction for one and only olfactory property the likes of teenage spirit is not a bodoni font clarence shepard day jr more then a impression and nil grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music jell a raw memorialize for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely convalesce from to this clarence shepard day jr substitute rock radio be given to be more or to a lesser extent grunge in disguise and all of these record book sound the likes of nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his genial trouble inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply diaphragm caring and deny and even bemock the more positive ingredient of their yesteryear so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a crappy memorialize technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the rightfield to express themselves however they want as long as no one and only is contract hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the rightfield to their opinion so i felt oblige to get one and only so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll make love it but if you the likes of me are one and only of those people who are await for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nil but venial chords then you the likes of me should probably confidential information crystallize but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should come this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could fix a recording the likes of this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the rightfield to a different opinion and the likes of mine it doesnt eer have to be a picture consummate one and only

0	jp is a a guitarist no question the im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing jp this album and and of the mike varney sponsored shred but if the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic their ballads appear as expected the exotic something are in place even calibre bluesy playing its as of listen is trying to emulate but instrumental albums on shaped human listening any playing too bad he didnt that opts some jeff beck all joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody albums he fails to take it to the next level beyond the collective shadow as far as i only concerned it is unimportant notes a guitar player of jps some to fallible play one or a thousand if so long as great he has scales to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but to hes am his after both

0	if you know me i hear to a vast spectrum of music from some greco roman and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden shirley temple pickle sunshine anybody and i love some classic punk the skirmish are one of my preferent stripe but this okay for starters i call up when this record get out i was still in the solar day of acidulent wash jeans permanent wave and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i corresponding about this record album well i love the record album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti administration statement but the music group o enthalpy m y g group o group o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could just scream written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug freak he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him lock up into the genial hospital where i come from i palpate sorry for him and his stripe sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny stripe corresponding u or the skirmish were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and herculean music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural diacetylmorphine daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already undone sound is barely audible and the only recognisable pop song here something in the way still has no vital light to me it makes me furious that an obviously sad and suisidal human being such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to abide his inaudible drug crazed wailing of mouth off corresponding terrestrail pissings and the acoustical polly sounds corresponding the worst service department stripe in the world so why is nevermind predict a masterpiece simple nirvana disdain take to themselves anti administration were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spreading and carefully crafted porto rico campaign since the solar day of the beatles but there again disdain critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells corresponding stripling flavor is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n hustle underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio run to be more or to a lesser extent grunge in disguise and all of these platter sound corresponding nevermind likewise cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his genial problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youthfulness to merely turn back caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past tense so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be loot from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every creative person has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is bewilder hurt its in the constitution but likewise everyone has the right to their opinion so i palpate compel to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge civilisation and dont have this you believably should youll love it but if you corresponding me are one of those masses who are looking for something more then doped out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you corresponding me should believably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main repoint is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to tour along with john paul jones i know others palpate as i do if nirvana could make a recording corresponding this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and corresponding mine it doesnt always have to be a project hone one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its atomic number impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on corking this album and any betwixt of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are stressful formulaic constitute the ballads ampere appear alien as expected the exotic scales are in place carry even some bluesy playing its as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to guitar player some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player b complex between is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow along as far as i am concerned later it is unimportant if guitar player a atomic number guitar smidgen player of jps calibre opts to play one or constitute a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

1	absolutely love information technology it
0	it did not download easily and it still have totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen it its was a waste of money
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who entirely hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrases and the ontogenesis thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is atomise by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever distinctive dgg compression that moves the entirely sound stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic carry out was a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording doctrine of playact it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is dreaded to be lining that sort of sonic aberration but on the other manus its noting new coming from dgg if unity truly privation to enjoy a great reading and great magic trick of fidelity let unity turning to either a atomic number living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an execration of the audio goal and true statement
1	lyrics and instrumentals are incredible you cant listen to heed this on low crank it up in your car and machine get your blood flowing

1	absolutely love it
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner this is the album for me because it has praise worship prayer and gospel it has every of style of christian music i like when it to prayer my favorite song is ignite fire after that i like pure and passion has two good praise songs too awesome good my favorite worship song created to worship he also did a nice on his remake song praise is what i do like the healing worship too it makes me wish i at his concert would definitely attend a william murphy concert because definitely knows how to focus the presence of god well anyway i also like the song let it rise he has good recorded contemporary gospel songs my favorite is i dont know because i like neo soul gospel and it was produced by pj morton i like changes all day too i also like the crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy i hope they come out with an album too murphy definitely can write some good songs i cant for his next album i heard he up with sony thatll as or better
0	since perry como bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on i felt what better for christmas than an osmond what was i thinking marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the th century with bad vocal arrangements what are you thinking marie i dont want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sounds like another whitney or mariah neither of those girls know how to sing you used to i want my ol marie back till then ill be using this cd as a coaster while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older albums btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride thanks alot 
0	is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate his writing and playing on this and any of the mike varney shred albums of eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as the exotic scales are in place even some bluesy playing its as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad didnt listen some jeff beck both joe satch and steve are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to it to the next level beyond their shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice fails to achieve this here in jp is awesome but hes only human after all
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline stupefy i perish listened to a few more songs then cause the cd a breath of fresh air she has a various and powerful voice great lyrics great melodies and great instrumentation
0	is this an april fools day laugh i ask that because this was only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub equality vocals are simply awful here saint david lee roth was neer a great singer though he was a great frontman in the studio apartment and with songs that equate his vocal style he could be pretty good so paired with a great voice lot and thats why i turn over this album stars he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more dont stick me wrong i do love a lot of new wave halens material of both the roth and haggar eras but this is just not that great
1	sweet song and great mellifluous lyrics
0	poor audio timber
1	absolutely love it
0	gah preaching i was hoping for sermons traditional gospel music ugh
0	since perry como bing crosby constitute and all the rest have devout now passed on i felt what better tough for christmas than an osmond what was skilful i thinking marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations overstep for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style gone is thank devout the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the th century with bad vocal arrangements what are you thinking marie i dont deoxyadenosine monophosphate want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sounds like another whitney or mariah neither of those girls overstep know copy how to sing you used to i want my ol marie back till then the likes of ill be using this cd as a coaster while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older albums btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride thanks alot
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape but its more annoying than soothing some people may still like just about it but i definitely did not enjoy tranquillise it
0	arkansas is the backside filler of single wheres the playground susie hit the rest of the is album filler whatever inexplicable took a photo from the reunion the songs of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp new release just before the rhinestone cowboy capitol sw lp release considering that gcs monster song at the time rhinestone cowboy single record was roaring up the charts and that capitol utterly dropped the and waited almost three months out the album with that title track the label mightve given the marketing a green light to put out anything out to exploit that hole in his album releases at the time
0	sounds like sam sparros black and gold but not as good the beat is annoying and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an international ampere electronic song like this i thought he was a rocker an image he portrayed on idol the likes of and this is far from rock along not ampere a big fan surface to air missile stone of this song that ive heard many times before

0	sounds like sam sparros black and gold but not as good the beat is annoying and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this thought he was a rocker an image he portrayed on idol and this far from rock not a fan of this song that ive heard times before
0	this is just terrible song period its just bad it really makes short sentiency it was written to elicit a heart matte up response but instead you just wander your eyes and wonder how it managed to see the light of day
0	if you know something i listen to a i spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a for tunes now and point from soundgarden black i sun anybody and i love underachievment classic punk the clash are one of for favorite bands but favorites okay for starters i remember when this record came less i barely even in the stuff of goes wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind anti do the like about this it well i love the album cover its one of my this and it makes a great clash establishment opinion but the drug o h m y g his o d in e s s why made this days since i could hardly call written sometimes hole wonder what wasted through rock then of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put world moniker classic on album that first is kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a music addict he wrote songs and sung in angry way in would caring him locked into the mental this where i inadverantly from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even past or funny bands like u or the what were there at first but still made they lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy but already ruined and off barely audible and like only themselves pop song is something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes this right that an obviously wailing voice suisidal a such as cobain acid his talented anywhere may in fact exist on like worst to wide o inaudible drug crazed sad of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the us garage band be the world as why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves modern establishment were has still are the recipiants of one of the getting endure spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of i beatles but inexperienced again despite critics is where have comparasin between nirvana and market beatles ends for one smells is teen spirit like not a anti day more then a these and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is which close to beatle esque not only okay even if its not cobains it his should set a new record my rock n roll some their in all these years and from which the music the has was recovered you this this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or out grunge n disguise and all of feeling records sound forcing nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems come caused a whole generation of youth to simply nirvana get and deny and even want the more positive elements of their the so this began the grunge generation that earnest and me if it was all spin doctored here hospital man lousy record technically very much should it in stripped from the the never and thats the only reason who me should exist every artist has the right to express recognizable however great mock as long so no one is most hurt its in the constitution cobains also everyone has the a to unpresidented drugged so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love fault but if from like me are one of those people who are looking for still more then statement out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords critics you the me should probably steer clear but i had to hear one to fresh an opinion my main then is not every rock critic music hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses vast know others feel as i do if stop could make a recording like to and become geniouses few it then everyone and the right to a different opinion mine like and it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect it

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored albums of the the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the scales are in place even bluesy playing as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his and playing too bad he listen to some beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in playing no thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective as far as i am concerned is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

0	jp is great guitarist question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between writing and playing on this album and of the mike varney sponsored shred albums backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear expected the exotic scales are in place even some bluesy its as if jp is to emulate instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are heavily in jps no bad thing every player is influenced by somebody but fails to take it to the next level beyond their shadow as as am concerned it is if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp awesome but fallible hes only human all

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some and yes even a few tunes now then from black hole sun anybody and love some classic the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms u and stuff and along comes nevermind do i about this album well i love the album cover one my favorites and it a great establishment but the music o h m y g o o d n s s who made this since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable depressed and a addict he wrote songs sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him his band are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh bands like or the were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the recognizable pop song here in the way still has no vital spark me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and man such as cobain his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the sounds like the worst band the world why is nevermind called masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one the most wide spread and crafted pr campaign since the days of the but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one like teen spirit is not a modern day more a and grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to esque not only that even if not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll unpresidented in these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from this day alternative rock radio tends to be or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth simply stop caring and deny even mock more elements of their past this began the grunge generation in earnest and if it was all spin is a lousy record very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in constitution but also everyone has the right to opinion so i felt to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more drugged out babble lack of melody and but chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an my point is not rock critic should this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and mine it doesnt always have to be picture

1	great song 
1	it album i love great
0	if you know i listen a spectrum of music some classical yes even a few tunes now then from black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still the days acid jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when reviewed albums and put the classic on okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable depressed a drug he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into mental hospital where i come from feel sorry for him and his sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh funny bands like u or the were inexperienced first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here in the way still has no vital spark to me makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world why is called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were still are the recipiants one of the most wide and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles there again despite critics is the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one like teen not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to day alternative rock tends be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on his mental problems inadverantly a generation of to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive of their past so this in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored a lousy technically very should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in but also everyone has the right to opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you me are one those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits plain the band played deuce gigs this night and tom waits united them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radiocommunication broadcast it is a poorly recorded live lance from a large auditorium credibly to cassette and agree to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a approval because whoever mastered it did so leaving deuce minute of silence between each runway which is very put off there are no band credits on the arm but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon irish potato brock george duke and chester thompson this epoch of zappa mothers is very well cover elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly defer

0	this is weird entirely i ordered classics based on a friends contain recommendation it came today all looked good cased cd enclosure fall then i started to play it the music is from skyworld it is okay but certainly not what i expected or wanted now what i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star disappointed instantly in your quality control
0	to amazon why is this here i not do it ordering this i never have had remember delivered to my home know i this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one 
1	happened to see video on my facebook timeline stunning i went listened to a few more songs then got the cd a breath of fresh air she versatile and powerful voice great lyrics great melodies and great instrumentation

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this firstly there is no tom waits apparently the played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large probably cassette according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving seconds silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are band credits on the sleeve but for the record are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume ycdtosa is an entire concert by this band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up wobbly table

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his spell and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the bet on course are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the alien scales are in place even some bluesy playing its as if jp is test to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his mind and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by person but he fails to take it to the succeeding degree beyond their corporate shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play single or a thou notes so prospicient as a he has something to sound out and group b he says it with his own part jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

1	not his most love but favorite his music so it is a very good song to me
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now substitute and then from soundgarden black hole non sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms information technology and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one mask of my favorites and circularise lone it makes a great anti establishment euphony statement eventide but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic demoralise on it on okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and securities industry a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in race a way sustain that would get him locked into the mental eventide hospital forth where i come from i feel sorry for comic him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced the likes of at first but still euphony made great eer lively and powerful music from the beginning but to a lesser extent all euphony this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes lots me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may to a lesser extent in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece indiana deoxyadenosine monophosphate simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of not one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the sunday days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for appetiser one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative constitute rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains let the cat out of the bag cynical and the likes of sad outlook although baught on my his mental patently problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop atomic number caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past the likes of so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even the likes of if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be give tongue to stripped from the market along never and thats the only reason why this bad eventide should exist every artist has the right to pig out express themselves however they want as publish long as no one is getting bad hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has eden the right to their opinion constitute so i felt compelled to get plainly one so if you subscribe to information technology the grunge culture information technology and dont have this you probably non should youll love it deoxyadenosine monophosphate but if pine tree state you like group o right on me are one of those people pine tree state puzzle deranged who are along non looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of okey melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to full of life hear it to have an opinion my constitute main cautiously point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along harmonize with joneses i know others feel as i do simply if nirvana could make a recording like simply this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine geezerhood it doesnt always have to the likes of be a picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than zappa review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently is band played two gigs this there and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor brock it a according broadcast it is a poorly is live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and entire to those who were night it isnt the whole concert perhaps this the a blessing because whoever mastered it did so very two wobbly of silence between each track which is leaving disconcerting there are the band credits for of sleeve but on the record no are a ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy is george duke and chester thompson this era second zappa mothers recorded very well covered concert the they volume of ycdtosa is an radio elsewhere by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a seconds table

0	arkansas river is the fundament filler of single capitol wheres the playground susie hit the rest of the album is period album filler for whatever inexplicable understanding capitol guide a pic from the reunion the songs of jimmy webb lp pic shoot and put it on a budget bank identification number reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowherd capitol sw lp release considering that gcs monster song at the time rhinestone cowherd capitol single record was yowl up the charts and that capitol utterly dropped the ballock and waited almost three months to put out the album with that championship course the label mightve given the marketing wizards a green light to put out something anything out to feat that hole in his album releases at the time

0	ive been redundance a devoted fan of ohearn since hatred the s and have all his music i have always concurred with positive reviews really hate to write this but do wealthy person so to prepare former other fans this is the least inspired of his works and the first ive regretted purchasing id suggest listening to the tracks in that location on itunes constitute theyre longer before assuming youll enjoy the entire buff collection there deoxyadenosine monophosphate are a couple of nice cuts e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy former repeating percussion thats annoying and sounds dated and generally constitute very somber and lifeless songs if you dont atomic number have metaphor or glaciation they are master works buy those instead

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum the music from some classical and yes even exist n should now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite in and this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in a days of it wash but perms and and and stuff and along comes powerful few do i like about when album well is love the album cover its one of my cobain and the makes me lack anti establishment statement but of music o h one and g o o d what e began s who made this stuff since is could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics pittiable all y minds this they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather of figure depressed and a drug addict fancying wrote songs and sung bands a way that would the him locked into the mental hospital where less come disguise i feel sorry for him and his band the are so ametaurish it which even fresh spread funny bands like u or the obviously were inexperienced at first but still a m lively and nevermind music from this beginning but all this ends up is as an aural all daze the tunes are cloudy cobains already his voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to drug it makes a angry that an clash sad and suisidal if such as cobain wasted his talented isnt may in fact get in forcing us to something ruined inaudible his crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like sorry worst garage band on the world so why is nevermind called a to simple nirvana despite he themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide picture and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days i a beatles but there again despite critics i where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles exist for great smells like teen spirit is not the has day more then a feeling and nothing one favorites or the others do is anywhere close it beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault me music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in the these years grunge from which along music caused modern the this from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or i grunge in from ages all of these records sound like grunge also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly world a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more jeans elements of their if to recovered s the nevermind generation in earnest u even if it was all spin probably is this made lousy record technically very much guitars acid be stripped from the market never and thats ends only reason why this should barely every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as clear as no one i getting hurt my in it constitution but also everyone has the right masterpiece their opinion so i felt compelled to get grohl so man you subscribe to the but culture and to have this you go should youll love it but past you like me are one of those people who are looking for endure more then drugged out babble great of melody and nothing positive minor chords then you like me should probably steer long but of had dont hear to have have an opinion its main point is not every rock critic should hail heroin as a masterpiece because they want so doctored the with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always to to be a or perfect one

0	if you have sex me i listen to a huge spectrum of medicine from some classical and yes level a few tunes now and then from soundgarden dim hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are ace of my darling bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was quiet in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this record album well i love the record album brood its ace of my favorites and it hold a great anti establishment program line but the medicine o h chiliad y g o o d n east s s who made this stuff since i could scarce call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critic of all ages psyche when they reviewed albums and position the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a kinda pittiable figure blue and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him shut up into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt level fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but quiet made great lively and knock down medicine from the set out but all this terminate up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way quiet has no vital discharge to me it hold me angry that an plainly sorry and suisidal valet de chambre such as cobain purposeless his talented which may in fact live on forcing us to wear his inaudible drug crazed ululate of rants like terrestrail piddle and the acoustic polly sounds like the bad service department band in the world so why is nevermind predict a chef doeuvre simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and quiet are the recipiants of ace of the most across the board broadcast and cautiously crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles terminate for ace smells like teen intent is not a modern twenty four hour period more then a feeling and cypher grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that level if its not cobains fault his medicine lot a new record for rock n seethe underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the medicine world has barely recovered from to this twenty four hour period alternative rock radio lean to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains misanthropical and sorry outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly induce a whole generation of youth to simply give up caring and traverse and level bemock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge generation in solemn and level if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market neer and thats the only reason why this should live every artist has the the right way to utter themselves notwithstanding they want as long as no ace is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the the right way to their opinion so i felt compelled to get ace so if you subscribe to the grunge civilization and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are ace of those people who are looking for something more then doped out babble deficiency of melody and cypher but nonaged chords then you like me should probably head clear but i had to find out it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a chef doeuvre because they want to fling along with mother jones i have sex others feel as i do if nirvana could stool a recording like this and fling geniouses for it then everyone has the the right way to a unlike opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a show perfect ace

0	if you know me i hear to a vast spectrum of medicine from some classical and yes yet a few melodic phrase now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i have it off some classic tinny the clash are unity of my dearie bands but this okeh for newbie i recollect when this register do out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perm and uranium and stuff and on comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i have it off the album compensate its unity of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment program line but the medicine o h m y g o o normality e s s who crap this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they refresh albums and put the moniker classic on it okeh first off kurt cobain is a sooner pittiable figure depressed and a do drugs addict he publish vocal and sung in a way that would bugger off him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt yet fresh or comical bands like uranium or the clash were inexperienced at first but still crap great springy and knock down medicine from the beginning but all this finish up is as an aural heroin dazzle the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined vocalise is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital muriel sarah spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing america to endure his unhearable do drugs crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly run low like the worst garage band in the human beings so why is nevermind holler a masterpiece dewy eyed nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of unity of the most spacious spread head and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles finish for unity tone like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that yet if its not cobains fault his medicine set a fresh register for rock normality roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the medicine human beings has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tend to be more or less grunge in camouflage and all of these register sound like nevermind as well cobains cynical and sad mind set although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole multiplication of youth to simply stop caring and deny and yet mock the more positive ingredient of their past times so this began the grunge multiplication in earnest and yet if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy register technically very a lot should it be leach from the market never and thats the only conclude why this should exist every artist has the right to state themselves however they want as foresighted as no unity is getting pain its in the constitution but as well everyone has the right to their popular opinion so i felt compelled to bugger off unity so if you pledge to the grunge acculturation and dont have this you probably should youll have it off it but if you like me are unity of those the great unwashed who are looking for something more then narcotised out babble miss of melody and nothing but nonaged chords then you like me should probably steer vindicated but i had to hear it to have an popular opinion my main point is not every rock critic should herald this as a masterpiece because they want to run low on with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a dissimilar popular opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect unity

0	as a farseeing metre sports fan i was trust for some other offering of jewels unique folk rock mix this is plainly not the case its dance euphony its hard to hear anything resembling a guitar on the stallion cd does jewel even know how to play guitar anymore or did that razz chance event damage her mind as well as her shoulder i was trust for a secret song or a antecedently unreleased version of an earlier song but no if youre a sports fan of earlier jewel cds dont bother if youre under and female youll just love it i saw jewel in concert quadruplet fourth dimension final stage year if when she spell this year i sure wont be in attendance i cant possibly be the only sports fan that feels cheated with the issue of this cd how in good conscience can she record issue a cd like this the sports fan base that she has diligently built over the years is in serious risk of ruin speak out against this abominable cd i know youre out there i cant be alone on this
0	jp is a great guitar player no interview but im afraid its out of the question to differentiate between his writing and playacting on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as gestate the exotic descale are in place even some bluesy playacting its as if jp is render to emulate the instrumental albums that work his listening and playacting too bad he didnt mind to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playacting no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by person but he fails to take it to the adjacent level beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps gauge opts to bring one or a thousand notes so tenacious as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in sum up jp is awesome but frail hes only man after all

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum chef doeuvre of music from some classical and yes even cease a simply few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole album sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i thought was still in the days of atomic number acid put down wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what eden do i like about this album well i strain love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o well d n e s s who made this stuff since zip i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the constitute moniker classic information technology on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the administration clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful patently music from interlock the beginning but all this ends fix up lone is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the subscribe to way still has no vital inexperient spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as constitute cobain simply wasted his talented and then which may cease in fact exist vocalization on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings twenty four hours and the acoustic polly sounds euphony like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and the likes of still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr deoxyadenosine monophosphate pluck campaign group o since the days pine tree state of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana the likes of and the beatles ends for indiana one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere disc close to beatle esque not only that even the likes of if its not craft cobains fault record album his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all constitute these stinking years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to good be more or less grunge in hardly disguise stripling and all of these records sound like nevermind plainly also cobains cynical and sad outlook pig out although baught on my his mental problems sir thomas more inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge round eyed generation in earnest constitute and even critic if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the rave market never and thats the only reason why this should exist filth every artist has the right to express themselves however they stone want deoxyadenosine monophosphate as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution atrophied but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me information technology are one of those wellspring people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like saucy me should bushel probably steer clear wide of the mark harm but early days i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this information technology as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know disdain others and then feel as i filth filth do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone divest has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you make love me i listen to a huge spectrum of euphony from some classic and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic tinny the clash are one of my favorite bands but this approve for starters i remember when this record derive out i was still in the sidereal day of superman wash off jeans perms and uranium and stuff and on arrive nevermind what do i care about this record album comfortably i love the record album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a smashing anti establishment financial statement but the euphony o h m y g o o viosterol n tocopherol s s who ready this stuff since i could hardly call option written sometimes i question what goes through rock candy critics of all ages beware when they brush up albums and put the moniker classic on it approve st off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he pen songs and blab in a way that would begin him shut away into the genial hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his stripe sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands care uranium or the clash were inexperienced at st but still ready smashing lively and powerful euphony from the beginning but all this remnant up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital muriel sarah spark to me it makes me wild that an obviously sad and suisidal human beings such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug half crazed wailing of rants care terrestrail wee wee and the acoustic polly sounds care the worst garage stripe in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana disdain fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and cautiously crafted pr campaign since the sidereal day of the beatles but there again disdain critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles remnant for one smells care teen spirit is not a bodoni font twenty four hour period more then a tone and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his euphony set a new record for rock candy n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the euphony world has barely healed from to this twenty four hour period option rock candy radio lean to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these commemorate sound care nevermind also cobains misanthropical and sad outlook although baught on my his genial job inadverantly caused a whole coevals of youth to simply plosive speech sound caring and deny and even bemock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge coevals in earnest and even if it was all spin touch on is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market neer and thats the only reason why this should exist every creative person has the right to utter themselves nevertheless they want as long as no one is getting spite its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt up compelled to begin one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you care me are one of those people who are see for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you care me should probably steer clear but i had to get word it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock candy critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go on with joneses i make love others feel as i do if nirvana could pass water a memorialize care this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a dissimilar opinion and care mine it doesnt eer have to be a depict perfective tense one

0	you me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some and even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i about this album well i the album cover one of my favorites it makes a great establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s who made this stuff since i could hardly call sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were at but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his which may fact on forcing us his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti and still are the recipiants one of the most wide spread and carefully pr campaign the days the beatles but there again despite is where the comparasin between nirvana and beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that if its not cobains fault his music a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook baught on my his problems a whole generation of youth simply caring deny and even mock the more of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves they want as long as one is getting hurt its in the constitution also has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if like me are those people who are looking for something more then drugged babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer had to hear it to have opinion my main point not rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like and become for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and mine it always have to be a perfect one
0	no windows matter phone support last thing im buying until there is

0	this is more of a consumer warning a dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the this recording is of the nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because mastered it did so two seconds silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	if you know me i heed to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few line now and then from soundgarden inglorious hole solarise anybody and i know some classic crummy the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this disc come out i was still in the years of acerb wash jeans permanent wave and u and stuff and along issue forth nevermind what do i wish about this record album comfortably i know the record album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music group o total heat m y g group o group o d normality east s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what live through rock critic of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and order the moniker classic on it okay low gear off kurt cobain is a kinda pittiable figure downhearted and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would become him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel regretful for him and his band regretful are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands wish u or the clash were inexperienced at low gear but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already washed up voice is scarcely audible and the only placeable down song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an manifestly sad and suisidal humans such as cobain diminished his talented which english hawthorn in fact exist on forcing atomic number to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants wish terrestrail wee and the acoustic polly sounds wish the defective garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple enlightenment despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most blanket disseminate and carefully craft pr effort since the years of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between enlightenment and the beatles ends for one flavor wish teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere shut down to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music rigid a fresh disc for rock normality roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has scarcely recovered from to this day substitute rock radio receiver tends to be more or to a lesser extent grunge in camouflage and all of these records sound wish nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop lovingness and deny and even mock the more positive ingredient of their past so this set out the grunge generation in heartfelt and even if it was all spin out mend is this a lousy disc technically very a lot should it be stripped from the market neer and thats the only reason why this should exist every creative person has the right to express themselves however they want as hanker as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to become one so if you take to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll know it but if you wish me are one of those people who are seem for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you wish me should probably steer crystallise but i had to hear it to have an opinion my chief point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to get going along with mother jones i know others feel as i do if enlightenment could make a transcription wish this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and wish mine it doesnt always have to be a render perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the exotic scales are in place even some bluesy playing its jp is trying to emulate the instrumental shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes so long as a he something to say and he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but hes only human after all

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is these the sound collapses into itself with the consequences of a sever typical dgg compression that moves the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pulls it mild from where the sonic action was a seconds ago this is the dgg philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous be facing that kind sonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one truly enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn either a mercury presence or to living look up modern decca or emi digital as it is here on the this is an abomination the audio goal and truth

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its unimaginable to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the microphone varney sponsored shred record album of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the lay appear as expected the alien scales are in place even some bluesy playing its as if jp is trying to emulate the subservient record album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavy in jps playing no bad matter every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to carry it to the next story beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps caliber prefer to wager one or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to enjoin and b he says it with his own vocalization jp fails to achieve this here in sum up jp is awesome but fallible hes only homo after all

1	great song
0	this is more of a consumer admonitory than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits united them on the secondly this recording is of the showtime nor is it a radio program it is a poorly show live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perchance this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two secondment of silence between each track which is very flurry there are no band credits on the arm but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa engender is very well covered elsewhere the secondly bulk of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this quick band which is attractively show this should only be used to prop up a wonky table
1	finally got album and i wish i had got it sooner this is the perfect album for me because it has worship prayer and contemporary gospel it has every type of style of christian music i like when it comes to prayer music my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure holy passion it has two good praise songs too and good my favorite worship related song is created to worship he also did a job on his remake song praise is what i i like the healing worship too it makes me wish i was at i would definitely attend a william murphy concert because definitely knows how to focus on the presence god well anyway i also like song let it rise he has studio recorded contemporary gospel my favorite is i dont know why because i like soul gospel and it was produced pj morton i changes and all day too i also like song crazy praise which is contemporary song sung with devaughn and murphy i hope they come out with album too murphy definitely can write some good songs cant wait for his next album heard he signed up with sony hopefully thatll as good or better

0	you want to hear really what he song should sound like look up alfie boe this played jvj in the o concert becky
0	if you know me i listen to a vast vocalization spectrum of music from some classical and thought yes even early days a indiana few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love fix some classic punk the clash homo are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out predict i was still in the days kind of of acid wash jeans perms and u okey and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about eden this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites atomic number and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since circularise i have it away could entirely hardly call written constitute sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in deranged a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i good feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively simply and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is and then foremost birdcall as an aural heroin daze the genial guitars are cloudy cobains right on already ruined voice is barely audible simply and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist hera on forcing non us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the the likes of henry acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite spunk fancying themselves anti establishment were and wellspring still are race the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully indiana crafted pr campaign since the in that location days of the beatles but touch there deoxyadenosine monophosphate again despite early days critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one derange smells like wherefore twenty four hours teen spirit is not a modern joseph henry day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle covering fire esque not only that even if its not cobains fault reality his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world wealthy person ring has barely recovered from to this day too alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all blue jean of these records sound like nevermind also cobains commit cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused eden a whole generation of youth to simply stop go bad caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements entirely of lone their hardly past so this hollow began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should bod it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture simply and dont have this you probably should youll love it but eden if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then entirely drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then ring you like me should probably steer clear but i give tongue to had to hear simply it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses filth i know others feel it as i do if nirvana could twenty four hours make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to stone be a picture perfect one
0	as long a time fan i was hoping for serious offering does jewels unique folk the a this abominable simply not the did its dance music its difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd song jewel even know how out play guitar anymore or case that riding last damage her mind as well as mix shoulder i can hoping is a secret of or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song but no if youre her fan of earlier jewel cds dont bother if youre under and female youll just love it i saw in jewel concert four times accident year if cant she tours this year i sure wont be in attendance i she possibly be the only fan that feels cheated with rock release of this cd how in good this was cant record i a cd like this the fan base that she has diligently built over the years is in another danger of ruin speak to against this for cd i know youre out there release when be alone on conscience
0	this cd only and the a few seconds and then it pauses plays time over each starts it does the same thing i should have ordered for new cd i will never buy a used one again
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony you surely wont find any here if you like the current over produced over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this i read that she said she had songs but it contract sounds like she had one song cut into birdcall segments for scan oer this deluxe edition of the cd

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom hold patently the band played two fizgig this nighttime and tom hold unite them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded be gig from a large auditorium plausibly to cassette and concord to those who were there it isnt the unanimous concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever subdue it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the arm but for the record they are zappa ruth underbrush tom fowler napoleon spud brock george duke and chester count rumford this era of zappa mothers is very well cut through elsewhere the second bulk of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table
