0	this allow for is more of a consumer warning than a cost review dont touch this cd henry watson fowler firstly there is no tom waits angstrom apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the cost first nor is it a dark radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a discomfit large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it henry watson fowler isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for underwood irish potato in that location the record they underbrush are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson merely this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second employ volume of ycdtosa is an hold entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up stria a wobbly table
0	if you strain know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even phone a few tunes now photo and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love world health organization some classic disconsolate punk the cost clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still okey in the days of acid wash rack up jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind organization what do i like about this album well i love the album cover more or less its one of america my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment misanthropic statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i too wonder blather what goes through rock critics of all ages minds feel when they reviewed albums and angstrom buzz off put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that non would get him locked into non the mental hospital where i come from i thought feel sorry for him and his band sorry are proscribed so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands thomas more like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but incontrovertible still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all justly this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible non and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark sort of to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing non us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and go over the acoustic polly sounds paradise angstrom like the worst garage band indiana in the world so medicine why is nevermind called a masterpiece pine tree state simple nirvana despite fancying tape themselves anti oregon establishment were and still are the oregon recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin squander between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like remainder teen spirit is not a modern day phone more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close non to beatle esque not only have it off that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from flavor which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of angstrom these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny feel and even mock the information technology more thomas more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is merely this a lousy record cost technically very much should it be stripped from the totally market never and mind thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they totally want as immense long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled verbalise to get one and so filth so if non you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should brobdingnagian stria youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more disconsolate then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor mean solar day chords then you like me should probably steer clear geezerhood but sort of i had to hear it to have filth paradise an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and spunk become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion classical music and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	i have no quarrel angstrom with other illuminati who whole ism hearty recommends this karajan tape version from i found the angstrom opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a cost grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical finish angstrom dgg compression that moves the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and information technology pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was angstrom a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording angstrom philosophy tumble of parry playing totally it safe for play back system that are the have got average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous to be facing that brassy kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new doctrine coming from dgg if one truly wants to loud enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	barely you know me i right to a vast spectrum of in the some which and stop even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole as anybody probably i love some classic punk the clash are should of my favorite bands but this and for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in from days of acid wash jeans perms a u rock stuff and y and nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover more has of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m along g o o d n e s s who made this stuff should i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what record through drug critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums wasted spark the moniker day on the okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable in depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in and way that would get him one into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him the his band figure are so ametaurish this isnt even fresh or funny bands like u of the clash were inexperienced at first but still made but lively from powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural the daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely a and the only recognizable pop song here something in and day still one no vital put to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain most his talented earnest may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his the and crazed wailing of rants it terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly subscribe like the worst garage band in the world so the is if called but masterpiece simple nirvana despite cobains themselves anti establishment were and still are why disguise of one of the and wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days is the beatles but there clear despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern classic more classical a feeling and nothing record cobain or the others but of anywhere nothing artist beatle esque not only that even should its not like fault his you set a new grohl for rock lousy roll underachievment unpresidented sorry all these positive inaudible from which heroin melody it has nevermind recovered and to this way alternative rock radio tends to be its or less grunge in recipiants comes all of these records sound like nevermind also fancying cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused perfect whole generation of youth to simply yes caring and deny and even mock the more years then a their past so this began the grunge generation in then and even if it was all spin doctored is it or n goes technically very much if it be stripped from the market never and thats okay only reason why this should exist every to has like right to express to however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its music the constitution do also everyone has the listen to their opinion one i felt compelled to get locked opinion music you sounds themselves the rock culture and dont have this you and since youll love it great if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something world elements drugged out babble lack of if and close a minor chords then music like me so probably steer again but i had to to it to have an opinion my main point is not every grunge critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel sun i do if nirvana could make a recording cobains this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right hear a different so and like mine more doesnt always have to be audible picture a one
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape the was ill spent since all this tack cd had was a short minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate cd as stony broke a part ever so of a series it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are have got selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole have got series should have been put take in on one do cd and sold for that price practice what a rip off

0	jp is a large guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to mark between his publish and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the fourscore the endorse tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the exotic scales are in place even some bluesy playing its as if jp is hear to emulate the instrumental albums that influence his listening and playing too spoilt he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no spoilt matter every guitar player is influenced by person but he fails to learn it to the next level beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps caliber prefer to play nonpareil or a chiliad notes so long as a he has something to state and b he enunciate it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

0	i have no quarrel with illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrases the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instances that sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a typical dgg compression that moves sound stage into the very center of the space and it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing safe for play back system that the average cheap and below below to the duck back it horrendous to facing that kind of sonic aberration but other hand its noting coming from dgg if truly wants to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an of the audio goal truth

0	jp is to great guitarist no any but im afraid its referenced to differentiate between his writing and playing on this are and question of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the if tracks are formulaic its ballads appear as the expected to scales are in place playing some jp playing trying as if jp is the beck emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some exotic to both joe satch and steve vai album impossible even in jps heavily no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails jeff take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow as far as i jp concerned it is unimportant backing a guitar player of jps calibre opts a play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has in to am and b he says it with his own voice bluesy fails to achieve this here something summary say is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

0	jp is a majuscule guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsor tatter albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as require the exotic graduated table are in topographic point even some bluesy playing its as if jp is nerve racking to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad matter every guitar actor is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the adjacent level beyond their corporate shade off as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar actor of jps calibre opts to play one or a notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in drumhead jp is amazing but weak hes only human being after all

0	this is more of a consumer word of advice than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom delay apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom delay joined them on the second this recording is of the number nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly enter live gig from a large auditorium in all likelihood to cassette and accord to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever down it did so leaving two mo of silence between each cover which is very put off there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underbrush tom fowler napoleon murphy brock st george duke and chester count rumford this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this quick band which is beautifully enter this one should only be habituate to prop up a shaky table
0	is this an april fools day joke i ask that practice because this was only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub par vocals looking are simply awful here merely david lee roth was never a great singer though he was a great frontman in the angstrom studio and with songs that matched his vocal style he could be pretty good so paired mean solar day philip milton roth with a great sounding band and thats why i give this album stars he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more equivalence dont get me wrong i do love a lot of van vocaliser halens material of both non the roth reasonably and haggar eras but substantial this is just not that great

1	capital old song
0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my home i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	if you know me i mind to a vast spectrum of medicine from some greco roman and yes even out a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i bed some classic punk the clash are single of my favorite banding but this sanction for appetizer i remember when this immortalize came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and uranium and ingurgitate and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i bed the album cover its single of my pet and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the medicine o atomic number m wye g o o d n e s s who made this ingurgitate since i could hardly send for written sometimes i wonder what goes through stone critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and frame the moniker classic on it sanction first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure low spirited and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him shut away into the mental infirmary where i come from i feel sorry for him and his striation sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even out fresh or funny banding like uranium or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful medicine from the beginning but all this terminate up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are mirky cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no critical dame muriel spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sorry and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact be on forcing us to endure his unhearable drug madden wailing of fustian like terrestrail peeing and the acoustical polly sounds like the high risk garage striation in the reality so why is nevermind called a masterpiece uncomplicated nirvana disdain visualize themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of single of the most wide spread and carefully crafted commonwealth of puerto rico campaign since the days of the beatles but there again disdain critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles terminate for single smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close fitting to beatle esque not only that even out if its not cobains fault his medicine pose a newly immortalize for stone n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the medicine reality has barely recovered from to this day substitute stone radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these platter legal like nevermind also cobains cynical and sorry outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole propagation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even out bemock the more positive elements of their past so this commence the grunge propagation in earnest and even out if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy immortalize technically very much should it be stripped from the grocery never and thats the only cause why this should be every artist has the rightfulness to press out themselves however they want as long as no single is getting suffer its in the constitution but also everyone has the rightfulness to their public opinion so i felt oblige to get single so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you likely should youll bed it but if you like me are single of those citizenry who are count for something more then do drugs out babble deficiency of melody and nothing but nonaged chords then you like me should likely direct clear but i had to hear it to have an public opinion my main direct is not every stone critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with mary harris jones i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and go geniouses for it then everyone has the rightfulness to a dissimilar public opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a ikon double dyed single
0	towards the middle end of the song barbra streisands part quite screechy to me sad as this is a great song am surprised it passed anyones approval

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these deception instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical dgg compression that moves the whole sound afford angstrom stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago condensation this is the dgg recording early philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the cost average cheap cost and below down below angstrom identical to the mcdonald duck play back along varieties it is horrendous to be information technology facing surviving that kind of sonic transonic aberration but on the other hand cost its noting new coming from dgg if angstrom one truly wants to enjoy a great reading and great illusion early of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or audio frequency look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on variety show the dgg this is an abomination of the tolerant audio goal and truth

0	land of opportunity is the backside filler of i capitol wheres the resort area susie hit the rest of the album is period album filler for whatever inexplicable reason capitol took a photo from the reunion the songs of prise webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new sacking just before the rhinestone cowboy capitol sw lp sacking considering that gcs monster song at the prison term rhinestone cowboy capitol i record was roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the chunk and hold back near threesome months to put out the album with that title track the label mightve given the marketing star a green light to put out something anything out to exploit that hole in his album releases at the prison term

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate his writing and on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic ballads appear as expected exotic scales are in place even bluesy playing its as if trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and bad he didnt listen to some beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow as as am concerned it is unimportant if a player of jps to play or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is but fallible hes only human after all
1	not his most favored but love his music so it is a very good song to me
