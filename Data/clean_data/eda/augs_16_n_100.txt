0	if you make out me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few air now and then from soundgarden blackened hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are ace of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i alike about this album well i love the album cover it is ace of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d newton e s s who take in this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him interlock into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band alike u or the clash were inexperient at first but still take in great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain do in his talented which english hawthorn in fact exist on forcing u to endure his unhearable drug crazed wailing of rant alike terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly effectual alike the spoiled garage band in the cosmos so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of ace of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for ace smell alike teen spirit is not a bodoni day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock newton roll underachievment unpresidented in all these yr and from which the music cosmos ha barely regain from to this day alternative rock receiving set tends to be more or lupus erythematosus stain in disguise and all of these record effectual alike nevermind a well cobains misanthropic and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole genesis of youth to but stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the stain genesis in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market neer and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves nonetheless they want a hanker a no ace is getting offend it is in the physical composition but a well everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get ace so if you subscribe to the stain culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you alike me are ace of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out blather lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you alike me should probably point clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i make out others feel a i do if nirvana could make a commemorate alike this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and alike mine it energy not always have to be a picture perfect ace

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate roughly between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his reference listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve whatsoever vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond later their collective group a shadow a far a i am concerned plateful it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome later but fallible he hour angle is plate only human after all

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of favorite and it make a great anti statement but the music o h m y g o o d e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where come from i feel sorry for him his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice barely audible and the only recognizable song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad suisidal man such a cobain wasted his which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but again critic is where the comparasin between and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you love it but if you like me are one of people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece they want to go along with i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a brobdingnagian spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic goon the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for appetiser i remember when this immortalise came out i evergreen state still in the day of loony toon wash jean perm and uracil and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a cracking anti brass statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and couch the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a kinda pittiable build low and a drug addict he spell song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like uracil or the clash were inexperient at first but still made cracking lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already deflower vocalism is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no critical glint to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing uracil to endure his inaudible drug crazed bawling of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti brass were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains flaw his music set a new immortalise for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these immortalise sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental job inadverantly caused a whole multiplication of youth to simply plosive consonant caring and deny and even bemock the more cocksure element of their past so this began the grunge multiplication in earnest and even if it evergreen state all spin fix is this a lousy immortalise technically very a lot should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only rationality why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i matte up compelled to get one so if you pledge to the grunge finish and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with inigo jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this second base recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not airplane propeller the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered george vi it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the epoch sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom information technology fowler turkey cock napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era set back of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of time lag ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape group a the wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a along series it is evidently a recording of a meeting m ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are ever so selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price what a rip off
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the and have all his music i have always concurred with positive review really hate to write this but do so to prepare other fan this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming you will enjoy the entire compendium there are a couple of nice cut e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy take over percussion that is annoying and sound dated and in the main very melancholy and lifeless song if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work bargain those instead
0	i no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the space it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back it is horrendous to be facing that of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording it here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
1	i love this song the first time i group a heard it wa at radiate and wa incredibly moved by it whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy

0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are of my band this okay for starter i remember when this came out i wa still day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y o o d n e s who made this stuff since i could call written i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote and sung in a way that would get him locked the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined is barely audible and the recognizable song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the garage band in the world so why is nevermind called masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of beatles but there again despite critic is the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny even mock more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is only reason why this should exist every the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do nirvana could make recording like and become geniouses then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of helium the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad helium appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that lay shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not bet on listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he adjacent fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it personify is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so speculative long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp inwards fails to achieve this here in summary jp is bad awesome but fallible he is only human after all
0	i like hammond organ enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar strawman are burried behind unfortunately steve morse repeating himself and record album his riff and solo are too predictable i love this band one of the best live band enjoyed last album but this relish one doe not work for me

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this atomic number firstly there is no tom waitress apparently the band played two gig this night and tom waitress joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the completely concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever get the hang it did so lead two second of silence between each track which is very flurry there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a shaky put off

0	is this an april fool day joke i ask that because this wa only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub par vocal are simply turn awful here david lee roth wa never a group a great singer though he wa a great frontman in the studio and neer with song that matched his vocal style merely he could be pretty good so paired with a great sounding band and that is why i give this album star need he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more do not get me wrong i do love a lot of van halens material of both the roth and haggar era but this is just not that great

0	to amazon why is this here i do remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my home i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash perm and u and stuff along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the cover it is one of my favorite and it make a anti statement but the music o h m y g o d n e s s made this stuff i could hardly call written sometimes wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from beginning but all this end is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains ruined voice barely audible and the only recognizable pop song something in the way still ha no vital spark me it make angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man a wasted talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not that even if it is not cobains fault his music a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world barely from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even the more positive element of their past so this began grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it stripped the market never and that is the only why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt is in the constitution also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you love it but if you like me are one of those who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one
1	i like the dave mark clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible i like all their song they did in the s

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not feeling this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio set disseminate it is a under the weather recorded live gig from a large auditorium likely to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very good covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to property up a rickety table

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found opening phrase and the development almost mesmerizing is until dgg recording team microphone is by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these that the sound collapse into with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg is an abomination of the audio goal truth

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band represent two fishgig this nighttime and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radiocommunication broadcast it is a poorly recorded live fishgig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so exit two second of silence between each cross which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very advantageously covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be apply to prop up a wobbly table
