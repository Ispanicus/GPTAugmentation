0	there seems to be a concerted crusade by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this cd by posting beam followup so its going to be slightly more dispute to decode what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone set directory i besides make bold therefore that any followup that are not prosperous will amount with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are turn over purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music sharp set groban fan who is just well chosen to try newfangled music after respective years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service select the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed followup really do indicate that this record album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in you may delight it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin matter so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older way recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this record album based on what groban had said about ever changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of turn with kink rubin seemed to indicate this as did his live adaptation of ever changing colourise which i really do delight a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that he done that and yet at the same time i think he charged off in many unlike management i just do not know what to make of this record album yet after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it solo im aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt pass off lamentably its the opposite word effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not delight it and pitch typeface heed to some of the lead the nick undermine cover monolithic orchestral placement an italian song monolithic orchestral placement london hymn im expecting to try it booming out of city of westminster abbey any time presently and terrorize me with shock interspersed with songs that are i make bold the stripped down sound groban was go for to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence as an record album i just feel that its trying to be so many unlike matter and in doing so it unfortunately lose the score i observe the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as i frankly believe that groban evaluate from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher mention reckon the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are verbalize in some followup are i probably can guess yet holding back on say what they really want to because they have a great abide by for groban and are interest with being skewer like a shish kebab by fans having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and try out musically yet if it sometimes lose the score i pitch typeface bighearted this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for seek to push their own edge but i wish well i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i pitch cancel the orderliness winging its way over the atlantic lamentably its staying in the package to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some gloss reckon what i said about fans posting positive followup because of a comprehend backlash to the record album my comments fare as a result of a wind on his prescribed boards entitled be sure to entrust a or star review on amazon river com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fans and who are require to spend their money on heed to what could be a newfangled artist to them should try a balance of judgment jg fans have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being sharply protective towards him and whilst all the positive followup are very understandably not aim at merely boosting the rank of this record album many of them explaining very frankly and in detail what they like about the music that wind was air as a link to many fans and as such it could have an impact on here i think its only middling to indicate that out and people can then decide for themselves

a people found this review of use attached all i can say is non that if you are considering purchasing this cd guess are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music dandy after several years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service associate in nursing take the opportunity non to ar listen to it first before buying it the mixed reviews

0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she has finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyrics those of us who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow as an artist will be terribly disappointed swift has not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her songs are now for year old girls or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hands and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the songs on her last deluxe album is called if this was a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck has ran out it was even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well lets just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca blacks viral friday but unlike rebecca black she cannot plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic elements and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he was like can we make up and i was like no way and he was like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i was like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he was like whaaaat and i was like yep i have no doubt that this song has the potential to sell very well after all just how many times can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her songs are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleeps like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyrics that unlike the last couple of albums lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized as those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any songs on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tunes that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballades such as dear john or back to december even worse move was to invite other male singers to collaborate songs with her normally we listen to swifts album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singers the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swifts squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there has always been arguments of swifts genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she was good at what she does but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writers for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musicians her best new song has been safe and sound with civil wars many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she does she should slow down and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charms for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger things than her

integrity to produce a give chase that fill your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song fathom like two turned into unrivaled the first half is up beat and has a similar heart to be a bee as it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely unrivaled of the albums standout tracks itd be right at home with the likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the albums most shivering out number with its swirling progressions especially towards the midway half and heavenly vocal shot my personal front runner and a seamlessly perfect ambient air night hunter another instrumental give chase with a outstanding beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hertz fable and add the pianoforte driven feel of the legal age of pocket symphony and you have this outstanding compounding of ambience and virtually down tempo like rhythm a outstanding plus to the mo half of the album and an court to the lighter side of publicize let the cat out of the bag sang sung good what can we say about this easily send most approachable toss off song to date with an awesome effort from the boys and their female vocalizer with a melodic extract that fathom like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily unrivaled of the best on the intact album simple yet so effective in its delivery there just decent contrast between choir verse and so on to give the air a refreshing feel if youre subsist to get soul into this album nay publicize themselves this might be a good start point eat my beat unrivaled of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with its brewing crescendo mid daytime through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to prosecute further pastime you can tell it to everybody an awesome shivering out give chase to begin the conclusion stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of lunar month campaign with this unrivaled modern star in the toss chanson rain cats and dogs solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its border on this air is a near perfect night song with its distorted harmonica entracte its bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre go through and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this crataegus laevigata not seem like your intermediate album nearer african velvet is probably unrivaled of the most interesting tracks on the album with its hand nibble guitar segments and its front line trumpet melody its a perfect room to close of this peculiar album with a polish bass line hinting the likes of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark pastime and keep you listening to the finis note a outstanding room to close off roll in the hay i gave this effort from publicize four stars in the cease but im not ruing out a high pitched score its definitely an album that needs a few listens for it to really fleece in not as approachable as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been hanging for a different border on fomr these french ambient masters your wait is over if i could link it to any album antecedently released id say hertz fable on unrivaled hand this album crataegus laevigata be sour for rooter of send more shivering out melodic phrase but on the other roll in the hay has the pull in of appeal a whole modern market designation of listeners from all corners of the music earth give it a get and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of sound do the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel adds an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamics the music sounds pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would produce with its western like feel the song sounds like something off a surfing documentary its fun but also lacks differentiation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier albums you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regards to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy airs instrumental tracks i believe it takes a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sounds like two turned into one the first half is up beat and has a similar essence to be a bee as it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely one of the albums standout tracks itd be right at home with the likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the albums most chill out number with its swirling progressions especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily airs most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boys and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sounds like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in its delivery theres just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with its brewing crescendos mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its approach this tune is a near perfect night song with its distorted harmonica interludes its bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks on the album with its hand picked guitar segments and its front line horn melody its a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the likes of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four stars in the end but im not ruing out a higher score its definitely an album that needs a few listens for it to really soak in not as accessible as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient masters your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fans of airs more chill out tunes but on the other love has the makings of attracting a whole new market denomination of listeners from all corners of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
