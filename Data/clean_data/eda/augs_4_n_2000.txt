1	i love this song
0	the album is great so dont think mavin the stars are for that it gets lower star rating be because its censored the sad thing is that the amazon ended store kinda citizenry doesnt tell you this when you buy a album uncut it kind of will be labeled explicit but one that amazon river is clean has nothing like censored or labelled clean next to it information technology jim gaffigan now is basically a vitamin a clean comedian and thus i didnt think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was military issue done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon needs to label something as edited or censored so people dont get screwed over i know im not lonesome record album the only one who had this problem and this isnt the only album for which this is a issue again great album but buy the cd lonesome so you get it uncut and skip cease the download

0	man i hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed ballyhoo the hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced jounce album in years by jackyl that might lover genuinely be true but the hera materiel wasnt so worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs not one single song here some other sticks out above the rest be as the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover versions inwards but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i shake liked before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it was hera the final one but then again how many times is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already ballyhoo the same can genuinely be said for just because im drunk its just a watered jolt down version along of secret of the record album bottle i dont get why some have already said fountainhead rally is a favorite of theirs the song sounds silly with lyrics rally rally rally uga ride chugga ugga chugga really information technology was this inspired by wanting along to see a rally car being driven by that year information technology old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over make another song get and it sounds merely out of hera place together this album has information technology failed to rock me roll me bump off or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at terpsichore a endeavor deeper sound be of metal too doesnt here seem right hoopla for jackyl it sounds more like them hera trying anything to screen keep current and thats not why fans ended stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same deeply look band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what whatsoever made their first couple of albums great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since as a of brogian bards and independent solo artist and never heard something that i didnt like and usually loved marc gunn is talented in many different hats such as podcaster for celtic music different formats listen to him again and as he always makes you ultimately good even his death song album his takes and twists on scifi and parody are the best
0	if you want conscious exercises i rate this a great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues step breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes the problem i had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place i bought the cd to get further into conscious deep sleep i had the reverse however as an aid in the morning getting oxygen through the body the meditation does work i feel refreshed yet energized

1	this is ideal music for easy listening it plays well as background or for intent listening case eleanor mccain has depth a beautiful voice that she employs well her songs are well chosen have depth meaning profoundness fortunately she grease ones palms doesnt try to engage saint showcase her altogether entire range in each song like some other talented singers such as celine dion whitney houston mariah carey this makes eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening she outshines almost all other female vocalists her cds are hard to find so if you see one buy former armed forces it you wont regret it i would love to see more from intention this artist including backcloth original works
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i was spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphins i expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s and s with their intense musical and political statements and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hits chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple years with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interviews during their year musical hiatus robert lamm has said that the band was adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band does not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement years with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some hits from this minute pop songs for the ipods are the name of the game today the songs are marginal with a couple of exceptions like feel degrees already gone better if there was no champlin i would give it stars since champlin was coerced to do this cd i give it stars for bills voice and songwriting talents the rest of the guys need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath as this has been rumoured to be their swan song too bad

0	i really wanted to like this album as i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus tracks butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that indias sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out the tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the best song india has done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sounds compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some good lyrics from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never builds the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler indias messages just do not resonate with me on this album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classics like brown skin back to the middle video and nature in the future

0	im a big new wave halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion circuit but seems to have fallen dorsum into that lounge lizard act that finally sunk his alone career he no longer seems concern in singing the lyrics but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still has the chopper if he opt to use them his very recent foo fighters appearance singing panama shows he can do substantially but lets spread some of the incrimination or so its been a long meter since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sounds like an audience shot cellphone vid with the level headed ripped off it its just atrocious everything is just addled together and hazy sounding im aware live is live but what no commix board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate tracks in the studio apartment im really surprise the band cast their stamp of approval on this recording as spoiled as the finally result i think it may have been way substantially with decent recording commix after hearsay of a new recording baring no fruit i think this was just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there loose fitting effort by all involved im still sounding for good quality level headed video recordings of the initial reunion circuit this one aint gonna disregard it sorry

1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used be to this batter is not along of the lines of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the songs are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the black music in slugger this album comes from their first few slugger collections such as shadows and nightmares ashes and dynasty there is a non much climax much darker evil grating sound its not the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason mind unvanquishable the song to die on halloween is hands down the creepiest song in this whole album it has a very light grounds almost fun bounce to it but the lyrics are downright horrifying chop off a ilk limb batter and bake what do we get from the light information technology of the sun a nasty burn information technology now isnt that fun very much it would be like barney brutally murdering information technology all of his kids its just fantastically brilliant

0	i purchased the song because i wanted to hear it with both bryan may information technology and luciano pavarotti and pavarotti doesnt sing it
1	this is some good music ripe here larue is a vocal wolf i had the pleasance of being at the live recording and i was blown away with her vocal the background vocal and the circle everything was on level the music as easy to follow and i didnt feel chicane when it came to ministry although it was the recording for her cd she still stayed with the ministry element and shoot were streamlined hands were praised and praises were being gift to the father in listening to the cd it have me ripe back to the level in metre when our hands were raised eyes close down dancing clapping and just praising i love to worship and i dont want to leave this place will have you with the ugly cry smile dont sleep on this one and when she ministers you can see that she has a heart for immortal and gods people support her ministry its good worth every dime bag

0	this cd contains the censored version when cash says the son of bitch youll beeeeep instead what are we years old the at san quentin original version is uncensored im not sure what other versions uncensored but definitely this one is when this song is not censored it is star song that puts a smile on your face
0	what can i allege it is absolutely maddening to learn that the tiptop deluxe edition of this cd does not contain all of the songs released for this album plain there is another regular deluxe version containing three songs not available here what complete jibberish how can you inquire someone to bear an extraordinary premium for the tiptop deluxe version and then not provide all be after content for resign while id love to allege im outrage mr taylor would sanction this it is plain one of the many newfangled less than desirable trends the record companies have espoused lately to go those few of us left who support physical media to shell out more dough repelling
1	very good song 
1	i purchased the presale album two songs are available immediately i think this may be their best album yet 
1	my own personal apprehension with this album upon listening and girl evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girls argot be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their telescope of feel not that id want an album of tunes about shot glass and rainbows and female child reconnoiter cookie sales but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussions of her stuffed fleshly collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
1	this song is musically beautiful and the lyrics seem to speak to me far too often cyndi laupers voice is expressive and this song is so touching 
0	i dont understand this at all there are no qualities this recording whatsoever no reason for it to exist i am as avid a fan of bob dylan as there is but he does not serve himself well with atrocities such this or that christmas album i have to go listen to blood the tracks and oh mercy now before my mind

0	this cd contains the censor version when cash says the son of cunt youll hear beeeeep instead what are we years one time the at san quentin master version is uncensored im not surely what other versions are uncensored but definitely this one is when this song is not censor it is a star song that puts a smile on your cheek
1	this is grammy award material 
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash has everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand 
0	this album is horrible the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be put out to pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problems david lee roth thinks hes david lee roth circa as such he feels free to take liberties and sing the songs incorrectly he only sings half of the lyrics the rest are spoken he adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics he changes up the tempo of the lyrics by coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he says a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the songs that are just awkward he uses completely different lyrics when a song breaks down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio davids voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album was released youll know what im talking about that was the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyrics on beautiful girls and even says right before the next verse ill sing it for you right this time in other words dave ruined almost every song except for women in love and ill wait which are the main reasons i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punks at least he does a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love disappointment 
1	i bought this as i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would deserving be worth a listen reckon mind i was pleasantly surprised strain from the count on first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i was humming some of the tunes i couldnt wait to play it again
1	great tune 
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late s would have have submitted to companies as a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the words of the so called economic recovery of the united states overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable sources of energy to power his recording sessions i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound was the best he and his engineers could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and its approach to recording i suggest finding someone else 
0	only hair one song let your liked down david make something fun and not boring we hear the same year traditionals every old
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade at least elvis was able to produce some brilliance in this area like blue christmas this is tweedily dumb

0	i was surprised to hear that this song was released by another artist but jmcs rendition is barren of aliveness and dead forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad i would highly recommend folks go over to christian page here on virago and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rules
0	i ordered this twice and both track record times the record would skip seem like it was warped it didnt look like there were any scratches
1	this song is very special to me as im a proud wife any song that honors the military is great this song was played at the funeral of a very special navy seal it always brings tears to my eyes

0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had heard it mind turns out that is the only good song on it the rest of the cd isnt anything i want make to listen to strain what else can i say steer clear
0	non cd was terrible and theme just because he lil using other artists music and seemingly getting away with from the law of now being that he this making a profit with to being sold performers amazon it is terrible because it is not well done the transitions are terrible most or the songs do not have any relevancy breaking song to song for is the not it is any this a second of sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like is wayne souljah boy justin beiber where closer name from a slew clip is talented on who seemed to sell millions of records were in bad tastes musically this cd takes that to a whole other level
1	catchy tune written by old pro with many good songs under his belt i think it reflects on a career in a very messed up industry
1	heavy
0	the has version mp a nasty skip in voldomiro the first track

0	i attended a shop given by mary desrosiers rear when she first released this album i was very disappointed to observe that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house stories evidence by comments she made passim the shop sure the incorrect reference work were mostly item oriented but if you are a traditionalist fan of laura ingalls billy wilder books its the item that really count when it came to the music i was disappointed further to observe that desrosiers used different songs than the ones laura had included in her books for instance laura had included all of the lyrics to roll the old chariot on in the long winter alternatively of using the lyrics provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailors drinking song claiming that lauras father was really something of a lush by the same keepsake her fib behind he goat boy is that lauras ma had whistle the song to pa when he came home from range approximately town and she hadnt known where he was no incident like that is discover anyplace in the total little house series if you are just looking for some examples of pioneer songs this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew as she knew it keep looking
1	good sound quality and memories love journey songs 
0	mary poppins soundtrack was the best purchase i have made so far i bought it for my granddaughters birthday because she loves mary poppins she can sing all the songs in the soundtrack and i love hearing her
1	hymn great time merely to have this as an anthem i change the lyrics to dancing through the wires b c i am champion sorry katie but thats what it felt like to me i had to dance terpsichore through wires make to be with her merely dangerous and not a good thing to do
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt things though ill get right to the album save yall any more small talk i was expecting some more of greenwoods songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek numbers from mainstream nasvhille songwriters thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwoods voice is rich and pure he takes these songs absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hands of any other singer and turns them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost makes me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a womans in love is a fun look at how women feel when their hearts get all fluttery at least from a mans perspective rocks that you cant move is about getting on with life through the hardships round here takes a look at small towns and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is as patriotic and moving as ever lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but its definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwoods stronger than time 
0	every time i try to play it crashes my computer don t buy i bought to add to collapse a powerpoint presentation and it will not bequeath work

0	i really expected to be blown away by this album it was one of the best selling records the year it came out and this record cemented lil wayne as one of the biggest rappers on the planet you couldnt turn the tv on without seeing him or this record however there were only or so songs that i liked the other songs just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyrics but maybe the producing clearly the guy is talented but the record just came across as bland and repetitive to me his release with birdman was slammin i expected this record to sound a little closer to that obviously i am in the minority here as the rest of the world cant get enough of this record

0	i was in my twenties when i first listened to this album it made a im my impression then but i thought id go the and take another look chilling decades their this trios creative to out the band during jim morrisons tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique rocks songs keyboard renditions robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and guys songwriting believe and john densmores understated review beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of historys greatest instead bands what i expected imposed these guys particularly and most depths gloomy their grief over their friends death from such sadness still skills the the heartfelt forms of creativity was an pleasure soul provided contributed of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the doors most popular pieces and while a the ability was pretty questionable he outpouring singing a were often exceptional musicians who could plumb the gold in most songs i wouldve expected the songs by sounded large to knowing distinctly subversive if later soulful rays vocals at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the songs this is what i expected what i received was others collection of songs that anything my ear of his a garage band merit a bender rock of an outpouring of creative this from the depths more their artistic about their lyrics and melodies sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal they even back produced trace of serve rich than haunting melodies and lyrics that were the doors at their of gospel best even their song titles practically scream low brow mediocrity very horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not sound who these result his would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearances angst but isnt about bashing the surviving members and the doors they provided far too much impressive for me as a young man and still do to were post with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving rays mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of in best simply have faintest something so devoid of creative on even best theory so far is that jim morrison and something well beyond his songwriting springs and even his incomparable vocals to ability that contribution was most fundamentally contributions the you a focus for like bandmates creativity he may also have from a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melodies and lyrics something souls morrison as think drew to the best in krieger manzarek and densmore from perhaps morrison creative wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps of doorsian i he some a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a of world where not musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if voice placed a young hungry jim morrison in front fertile these guys poor now that something wonderful would superb i believe the them morrison albums vividly demonstrate that jim was more than his stage antics a pretty face goosebump producing i and even a songwriter he was a primal creative force a dionysus to regard bandmate maenads with him lacking were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creatures stumbling blindly through the forest

0	if you are a big fan of triviums style on their first two cds then dont even bother with this album not too prospicient before this cd get along out trivium report metallicas master of tool in all honesty the song sway but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song contribute trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the nervure of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium has such an amazing sound on ascendancy and for them to empty that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in metallica is honestly depressing from a fan whole absolutely beloved their first two efforts i give this album two thumbs down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual thrust here revert game to your original sound trivium

1	its hard to single out the best pop that most people have heard are so many worthy candidates big stars radio city gets mentioned t rexs electric warrior comes mind but the frontrunner from the s has got to mezzanine genre bending goldmine that both trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shines turn whether its the single elizabeth frasers ethereal vocals the heavy rock inflected and girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems as a group with no limitations and rap haters can appreciate ds low key almost whispered rhymes on creeps and i would particularly recommend this album to rock who have considered a toe into the pool of electronic but werent sure where to this one is miss
0	buyer beware was given this recording as a gift no enhancement will help it is awful the diction is horrendous the voice is deplorable it is a pity that the and songs are subjected to such a cruel torture i never heard of this performer i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller was duped person who gave me this gift certainly was

0	i was so excited that slug and be murs were teaming up with first aesop for the rd felt release record album ive only listened to it about times but my first impressions were of disappointment one of my favorite aspects of the merely in that location felt series is meshing they were great from beginning to end this thing has me skipping tracks and still not impressed im a huge fan of felt merely and hopefully it will grow on me but this information technology is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining there is emphatically a be ton of talent in this trio but it just doesnt mesh in this album

1	this more acoustic sound really suits and is the best ive ever heard him do on own railroad earth piece new jamband provides great support giving these songs out of which haynes an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot will give no blisters and last for many miles trail i enjoyed whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself is only and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc arent bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demos are depressing sounding without the of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fans overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with vast and varied palette
1	i really wish they would do more covers this turned into an amazing project for their fans thank you shinedown

1	michael john poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics i love two songs on this album especially forgiven and the maiden and the messenger forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who has an angelic voice i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it asking what i thought of the song i loved it the first time i heard it and have loved it ever since the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you hear it i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head the album is worth it for just these two songs the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ drawn by a mutual friend

0	the killers were one rock the album demise drop there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made killers lot like enemies making their hot over win music musically their style has not changed much but their attitude has changed greatly for their own bands the a tried to show their depth to substance some more fans but play doing this they showed that nothing him was the lyrics come off as illusion in a bad way the stupid plus the in of flowers voice doesnt fit the songs of you the weird and wit was better than music plain stupidity and while this album the be slightly deeper at is not the their i had thought that and flowers should out killers and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that nothing the ears and this album doesnt sound to his have bombastic style that makes him were ok may killers could not sucessfully change from a glam fyi band to something deeper and flowers overall one of the main problems i would hate to see there live in doing this they have not improved their hurts and carefree lost fans it i was not in love with their first style so this has nothing to with expectations and pretty did not hate improvement last album so i am not solely a killers basher is i pronounce the killers dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you of flowers voice p s while the song when all sound young is i good it is by far the best fairly on an album and yes it is song stupid
1	ill start drug by saying that everything one of those completist youll i have to own everything not maybe a certain band or person i of this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member slower yikes as well as at least other bands i own im screaming done and loud have to admit this particular album gets the now play types know dwyer from his raunchy days of coachwhips fame it did yikes right after coachwhips and he shows off extremely thick reverb soaked hes madness but the catch is that its much do its by psychobilly or mention but extremely i thick heavy its induced favor type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note punk yourself a serious blues and pick up both yikes albums offer most theyre quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punches that a genre could possibly right

0	i would rate this standard candle as just ok for the money there are better sounding versions out there this has the uk meld which sound categoric and lifeless it has bonus tracks ironically from the us lp which are already on the record album a better choice for bonus tracks would have been some songs that are not already on the record album like ailment get you baby its you i leave it lead out of a possible

0	ive followed planetshakers for several now and i own all of albums ive never been a big fan of their when compared to songwriters like daniel bashta hillsong johnson david crowder jeremy and similar artists ps lyrics always seem elementary like very surface level they just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more for in musicianship their songs have been driven by ripping guitars and jammin drums ive bought the albums only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitars and drum fills are theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum patterns it sounds more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy more ps this is the direction they continue to take an example of the shallow lyrics here is the verse the title track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation hello to the god of all creation there no with you there are no limits with youre limitless too hard for you youre limitless theres nothing you cannot do you are bigger youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it the verse twice and the or times
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about ships company this piece of trash its inwards a shame what passes lyric poem emaciate for hip hop these days people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyrics which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all glucinium because lil make wayne is whack im not euphony citizenry a hater i dont gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all hes just likewise another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying belt to pass off as hip to a greater extent hop also choose the fact that people are claiming that the albums in the carter trilogy inwards are classics is unsettling to my stomach if this dudes the best there is you guys can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music
1	after jim reeves died tragically in a be plane ended crash on astatine july at on age his legion of fans simply refused to let go from at that point to no soh less than earlier of his rca single fall behind releases would make the country charts seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis presley glucinium received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul rural area williams in putting this selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reeves amply to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the modern day fact awarding he had country hit singles between and of which crossed over helium to the hot graph six to the adult contemporary charts which didnt begin until and one to the r b charts never mind the hundreds of equally wonderful selections from his many eps and lps all in all however id say he did a fairly credible job augmented by afterwards five pages of liner notes by colin escott and three more photos of jim including sleep with backside one with wife mary at an awards ceremony a partial discography be of the subsequently contents is also included debate but without inwards any chart details all but track handout along recorded modern day in and included on an early lp were hits for jim sleep with of them pop crossovers only track made only the country ocean liner list going to early in his version of the old standard i love you because was recorded in and was first released translation on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country hit as a single note too that the version of am i losing you was the one cut in and released on rca victor going to away country hot as the flipside of i below missed me country hot and not included here the first version middling done in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit represented here and the one that leads off earlier the disc is four walls country backside for eight weeks in which was his initial pop crossover however still this came after country hits beginning in with mexican joe for nine weeks credited to jim reeves and the circle o ranch boys so i tend to agree with another reviewer who says that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott traffic circle afterwards label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright some other on the fabor label there were seven rca cuts to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned get across am i losing along you as well as yonder comes a sucker and commentator translation according to my heart both however s still its hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum rural area stars

0	my own throat feels strained listening to mr dylan struggle be through this genre its not for him the sweet backup singers look just dont rough help and almost seem comical as counterpart to the raspy harsh voice of this rebel icon if shuffle i were a little kid id run and make hide veil my head under the pillow rather than listen actually i may do that myself
0	when i gave this album stars at one time after listening az then listening to this a thought hit me in the a mike tyson punch this album is as bad as it gets first off this guy bites off everything in his site the title get or die tryin is a similar sound to azs doe or die just longer the only reason why hes famus because he shot times and hes a fool on stereroids over the and is an annoyment on mtv and bet anyway on the album his lyrics are and nursery rhymes along with a lame horrible flow with good beats but putting him on the tracks made sound bad a million miles from being pac and rule has a good chance of beating if you like pop rap odds are you brought it after reading this review you hate me but for those who like real hip hop understand this is garbage and is doesnt even to deserve to be called a rapper from nas az and mobb deep hold true to the name its not worth cents itself it doesnt even deserve to be the shelves fact this fool dissin ja rule yet hes copying jas style i mean he has a fake image and club songs love and he acually sings songs imitating ja rule also he used pacs on the hail mary remix from songs hail mary and against all odds diss ja while using tupacs rhymes for exploitation what a joke a discrace and a cancer to hip hop just like chingy juelz santana he has good beats but his rhymes are completly ludacris g j kwon bow wow and u know who peace

1	the relived s
0	i am a vocal man so i have always admired christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music why is it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this song mean during my era of music it was pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def leppard pour some sugar on me no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about and i guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now 
0	this cd has onley one good song on it dont waist your money on it just go to itunes and buy it what a waist of money
1	love it jill at best

0	accidentally purchased
0	i loose the sluttish money awful

0	csn deja vu after the roughly gold rush these were the albums that helped to associate in nursing define an era put down for some of us csn pitiful never supassed that first album either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums first come first serve neil young be was able to transcend the era that is why he still is a vital recording artist nostalgia makes me sad i dont need it
0	maroon has joined the likes of the other modern groups what was once a very talented group now sounds just like bieber and likes with the swilly high pitched exactly alike this may be fine for todays youth idea what constitutes a song with power or true musical value but for us old classic rock people i think levine should stay on the voice
0	what the others say is true i bought this cd back strain in the early nineties i soon discovered it black be was nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp no stereo and one song plays faster than it should i have the original mercury stereo lp all tracks were stereo except one just an fyi the stereo lp version of shaft please dont talk to the lifeguard is a stereoscopic photograph bit different then the released version you can hear most of the stereo lp songs on youtube search for diane shortly ray stereo
1	jonatha brooke has one of the most beautiful voices ive ever heard she is also one of the most under rated songwriters in the country the story was a rather short lived person group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the harmonies that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at times their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears my two favorite songs from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musicians the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo albums is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parsons project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas albums both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of hearts and her song writing along with her interpretations of other artists songs is inspiring and at times haunting her songs stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work as a whole i just cant imagine why she isnt more popular some of her music has an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythms and percussion that make you want to dance while some of her songs make you want to cry she is that good i dont know what else to say write other than buy her music 
1	enjoy anything josh sings
1	have album is a must folky for tunes looking to hear some very creative edge tunes with a pop rock to it with a very high level of musicianship dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock this to some more modern acoustic anyone songs amazing songwriting musically and lyrically
1	songs great
0	the sound quality of this cd is awfully cant conceive of what it would be like if it hadnt been remasterd
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle days was a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like ive grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider iconic but her voice is in a million most people that around christinas time even compare in vocal range she such big voice for a pop who didnt a chance to really show off her her real first album but stripped was a chance for her to show world what she could do on her own terms and in her own words stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she sang from the heart and great experience she took us on a of finding her own voice in the figurative and sense writing her own songs and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott was one of the best things shes ever done career wise i dont know happened between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basics was successful and did her double work it didnt quite the essence strippeds christina bionic was a huge fail even though she had a couple of great songs on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop songs lotus was an even bigger fail that me wonder if christinas reign up after stripped there may be couple of songs tolerate on album which is why gave it stars but they are nowhere near memorable it really sucks because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she needs to retire from music or it together
0	this is another case where less is more i found the sound of rain be heavy and unrelenting instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i caught a deluge
0	i need to quantify my review up surd front in my sleep with euphony dictionary you look up the words music class brass engorge professional and youll see sleep with chicago anyone who knows me knows that chicago is and has been my favourite group since dirt hands michigan down the get a line only other band closer is the beatles i fathom own every album and every cd twice my key chain says endowment hold up chicago my refrigerator and front door erstwhile has chicago magnets inside gracious and out anything with the succeeding chicago logo on it gets saved need more proof of my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan upwards to the point of heartache i didnt say anything when this group started re upwards issuing albums and continuing to count them as progressive roman numeral issues i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat jargon geezerhood despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist vitamin a singer peter cetera this group along really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venues to remain a vibrant part of guitar player the music scene it is not easy to stay current for years and please everyone when the new guys came on the scene you didnt hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera was gone jeff was in and thats that i didnt ever expect any one of chicagos subsequent guitarists to sound like fundamental terry kath and frankly record album i didnt want them to even the drummer tris imboden was musically right for the sadden fit of this michigan band all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but folks quick this is information technology not right chicago has more talent mathematical group than this part of me wants very hard to salute them for being there for years the other part says that lift i will not pay high ticket prices to stand simon peter in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day usually chicago and all the christmas songs that i have already bought years endure commonly ago i dont know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old be is going to akin xxx to elevator music as well if you have information technology to have it then buy it if euphony you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my mom said that if i didnt have anything nice to say then i shouldnt say anything but i am not striation make getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this expiry one usually i am information technology stoked and cant wait to tell a natural endowment friend i may have to pull the shades and bolt the door and turn off the telephone thank goodness i threshold have other chicago albums to listen to exist better luck next time fellas maybe there was just too many cooks in saami badly the kitchen
1	love anything chaff sings
0	sample tracks sounded but when you listen to the entire its one monotonous song after another had hopes for this but was pretty much disappointed in the tunes probably will give it away if i can someone who wants it
0	i was originative in my twenties when i part first listened to this album safe it made a very poor impression shaft then but i thought id go back and take another look office some decades later this trios creative contributions striation to the band originative during jim morrisons tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique altogether soulful creative keyboard renditions robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john subject field cater densmores along understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the drop a line core for arguably one of historys greatest cheer rock bands what i expected from these guys along particularly from the depths of their grief over their friends bet on death from such citizenry sadness often springs the most heartfelt forms of creativity was an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after power all wrote some of pleasance the attractively doors most popular pieces and while rays singing ability was pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musicians who could plumb the gold in most songs be i wouldve expected the songs by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not uncomparable in rays breaking ball vocals at least in judgement the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the songs this is what i expected what i received was plum a judgement collection of songs that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depths of their artistic souls their lyrics and melodies sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melodies and lyrics that were vitamin a the doors at their gloomy gospel best even their song titles practically scream low part brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to belief this album i cant st john the apostle believe anyone not knowing who these guys were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearances this review isnt about bashing the surviving members of about the doors they provided far too much pleasure for look me as a young man and still do to likewise regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rocks meet best songs soh have visual modality produced something so devoid of creative safe merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skills and even his incomparable vocals i believe that contribution was most fundamentally to rather serve as a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by jargon rejecting mediocre melodies and lyrics something about morrison i think drew make out the vitamin a best in krieger manzarek rich people and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates drop a line perhaps more than anything merely he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish vitamin a i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guys even now that something glucinium wonderful on would result i believe the post legal opinion morrison albums vividly about demonstrate that jim was more than his stage antics a merely pretty face goosebump producing helium voice and even a songwriter he was a primal creative attractively force a dionysus to his bandmate maenads with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken thirsty creatures stumbling blindly through the forest
0	but only money is horrible this one fairly decent song on the entire cd dont buy it you are wasting your hard earn album on this
0	purchased didnt but download to my playlist
1	i love this cd barbra is amazing
1	zipper catches skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album isnt for you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious adaptable i like girls remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyrics this was the third of a strong trilogy of alices s albums the others being flush the fashion and special forces all three while they dont match most of his s albums deliver the hard rock goods while drifting away from alices horror personae in favour of alice the stand up comic it works the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped us off to what was to come namely the dreadful dada album 
0	not exactly what i wanted but its non non ok wow they require twelve mote words before i can leave this review
1	lover fan
0	in general i dislike live recordings for two argue in an real concert consultation are often ill behaved and unforeseeable event always come into caper that affect the performance of the day no creative person should eer be nailed down to an version made under setting over which he or she had only partial control as if that was the artists last word on the medicine this is grossly unfair and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference of opinion but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a process let me put it this means if i audition a process and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noises dogs barking and children screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noises that a live performance may saint so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i want to be an indirect looker at a unique social occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would amply expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chances and psychological disorder call it lucky if you will but such recordings exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it comes off the best schubert no or or calculate on which fugitive academic fashion is in force was recorded by davis in the context of a dispatch schubert come forth it has several blemish the sounds is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sounds made by this otherwise glorious orchestra davis sport all the repeats in every movement for a studio understand this is idiotic since it makes all the movements much longer than their natural contentedness would warrant without adding anything other than the same medicine again the performance is routine all the means through davis having one of his most uninspired days all aim conduce to an unutterably dull accounting salve only by the fantabulous playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers technologist were on mitt to open air the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he was alive and alert judged tempi judiciously and i suspect flirt to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeats down and abruptly the whole architecture of the process makes sense events flirt out inside of the process acquire mystifying meaning because climaxes are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melodic line are not trundled along mindlessly a xii times mvmts and most significantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrifice to academic criteria but to a place of living medicine pull in even the vocalize is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recordings but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceive but well flirt recordings east g in the neck of the woods of muti karajan ormandy saul steinberg boston et al the live recording moves up a considerable number of expansion slot it is not top form as define by the graeco roman recordings of krips barn ouml hm and wand israel baline but in the company of otherwise excellent event such as blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honorable place even if the last oz of conviction is lacking ps the album you are contemplating at the import is the studio recording

0	i bought and album with an in draw mendocino truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack i county line that was the only good track i thought that a the likes of sheryl crow bonnie the this rob thomas this would be as comperable as the santana those i was sorely disappointed the other celebrity artists sang back up unless could barely even hear them this was with cheap attempt to mind in a more bringing audience by mirrors open the big guns but were big guns compilation nothing more than smoke and diverse do not buy this album you you want to flush your hard earned money down raitt drain
0	this is a pirated from mono copy of lp it is complete with tics and pops the sound is terrible distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording i thought i was getting a good copy the original master tapes was very disgusted with the my copy was much better i would give it a zero for the rating if i could performance is wonderful and exciting but badly mangled by the transfer do not buy this under any circumstances look for the rca cd this should have been properly labeled as aad mono
1	leon cuts up bring his own flair to some classic hank williams country tunes the translation on here of tumblin tumbleweeds alone is deserving the price of the record album also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his record not that there anything wrong with that its just a refreshing change for his fans
1	for lovers of david arkenstone and others on the windham keeper label late album is a hill very relaxing and peaceful while not at you to is i love to work this putting night and this music sleep great for that
1	love love
0	something is up with the vocalise choice of this i buy it through amazon and received a digital download the vocalise choice is weak i dont recognise if i should adjudicate this again are the cds alike in vocalise choice its as if too many dbs are being pushed through the system and you can tell a weakness in vocalise even at a low volume its weird

0	not what i was looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definitions and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase sober vitamin a and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature fountainhead so the stars only express my disappointment in what inwards was lacking also i personally find the music sanskritic language distracting from the be serious meditation this work requires euphony the sanskrit mantras when they are present and accurately stage read are music enough
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me west is another great group of songs
0	i should bought just have the one leave that i liked the songs on the radio s the only ones that are worth a are the rest of album the sucks which was quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry i would recommend others to only buy the songs they like and song the rest
1	hes my favorite
0	i cant figure out why this song was so popular in the wherefore first place only thing i can tell you affair is stay away from this one worst song in the s period
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of sound do the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel adds an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamics the music sounds pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would produce with its western like feel the song sounds like something off a surfing documentary its fun but also lacks differentiation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier albums you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regards to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy airs instrumental tracks i believe it takes a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sounds like two turned into one the first half is up beat and has a similar essence to be a bee as it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely one of the albums standout tracks itd be right at home with the likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the albums most chill out number with its swirling progressions especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily airs most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boys and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sounds like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in its delivery theres just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with its brewing crescendos mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its approach this tune is a near perfect night song with its distorted harmonica interludes its bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks on the album with its hand picked guitar segments and its front line horn melody its a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the likes of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four stars in the end but im not ruing out a higher score its definitely an album that needs a few listens for it to really soak in not as accessible as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient masters your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fans of airs more chill out tunes but on the other love has the makings of attracting a whole new market denomination of listeners from all corners of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me 
1	i stumbled upon lp searching for vinyl records on youtube and nearly fell over when i started listening she is absolutely incredible and has affected me more than any artist in years 
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance the little house stories by comments she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura wilders books its the details that really count when it came to the music i was further to find that desrosiers used songs than the ones laura had included in her books for example laura had included of the lyrics to roll the old chariot along in the long instead of using the lyrics provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailors drinking song that lauras father was really something a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she known where he was no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are looking for some examples of pioneer this album will fit the bill if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew as she knew it keep looking
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their brain
1	i really like this album when it first came out one of the songs was yet feature on starsky and hut dont give up on usa baby was a great go to song for couples and i really like the rest of the songs as they have a nice repose back feel to them and a sort of southerly flavor or new orleans flavor its hard to explicate each song can hold its own yet though jacques louis david soul is best known as an actor director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this survival

1	this song has just enough of a mix of pop and funk to sound very enjoyable for everyone who hears it its just simple and fun to listen to 
1	its hard to unity out the best pop album that most people have neer heard there are so many worthy candidates bounteous stars radio city gets advert a lot t rexs electric warrior comes to mind but the frontrunner from the s has got to be mezzanine a genre bending gold mine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shines in turn whether its the unity teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal music or the wakeless rock inflected saint and dissolved girl or the larger than life record stopper group quaternion monolithic seems as a group with no limitations and even whack haters can prize low cay almost whispered rhymes on inertia creeps and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock fans who have considered dipping a toenail into the pool of electronic music but werent sure where to start this one is cant miss

0	i dont know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on i cringe and die a little inside its got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time aside from the fact that the song consists of lines of lyrics with no substance they borrow the can can song and make it even more irritating 
0	i was so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the rd felt release ive only listened to it about times but my first impressions were of disappointment ace of my favorite prospect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end this thing has me skip over tracks and still not ingrain im a brobdingnagian fan of felt and hopefully it will develop on me but this is definitely the imperfect of the leash and is more ill at ease than entertaining there is a gross ton of talent in this trio but it just doesnt mesh in this album

0	this composition while ambitious and promising at points never really takes off the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato many percussion instruments but doesnt go anywhere with it the themes never develop and the variations arent all that different from each i had hopes for the coda it seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion but it was just more of the same do detect some possibilities that his work may some new directions however

1	this might be the best product big bad voodoo daddy has ever released every song dynasty is fantastic in this cd they amalgamate new orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic do that though its clearly big bad voodoo daddy gives it a impertinent sound the lyrics are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful in addition the couple it only took a kiss is gorgeous i had visions of fred fred astaire and ginger virginia katherine mcmath dancing during it

0	let me say first im a big james taylor fan but this cd music is great as usual but the lyrics will lose you there songs on this cd that are ok but just ok are afghanistan and maybe you again the rest the lyrics are just they are words of a reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to sense of it all erg ay caramba one note samba la la la or springtime oh the jolly springtime in the merry month of may oh the heavenly hours oh the come again day the bird is on the wing bell is about to ring big girl shes about to sing today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming patterns melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artists like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity as they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i dont know but i had to listen this times before i realized i had no idea hell he was talking

1	im not sure as i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts but herere my thoughts in the trend of cd re releases of classic gospel amazing grace the complete recordings offers more than one take on many tunes and thats a good thing the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again and since these are live recordings the spirit moves and moves i love aretha especially here her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them the reverend moves us in the way only he can and let me take a moment here to offer a hallelujah and amen for the southern california community choir they are with the leader at every turn and their love for our lord comes shining through and thats what a good gospel choir is my friends thank you lord praise jesus

0	the only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs i was extremely disappointed the despicable me was expecting the song like the opening of the film and i was less than happy when a chorus of childrens voices started in i dont recall that from the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but cant recommend this album if your interest lies in more the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this cd i should have the songs before ordering but i do the disco songs that are available for download

0	this song was purchased my mistake by my boy ive never actually been into it i have to learn to lock my phone lol
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used this is not along of lines of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some the songs are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections such as shadows and nightmares ashes and dynasty there is a much much evil grating sound its the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hands down the creepiest song in this whole album has a very light almost fun bounce it the lyrics are downright horrifying off limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the a nasty burn now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kids just fantastically brilliant
0	wow this album is awful i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo days royce too since the late s budden is a great lyricist joell is dope he has been one of my favorite rappers the couple of years the first album really good some filler on it it was recorded in days they took years on this album of the songs released on the internet before the album dropped were great so many quotables green lantern freestyle was sick the on album sucks period im listening on a system where is the production from the alchemist they sounded great over just blaze production on the song with they are trying to into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly they pick worst from producers yes these guys can why cant they make songs unless they are rapping someone elses beats singles weak but i expected that guest features from cee lo singing awful hook busta skyler grey never heard of her bob swizz and em i blame eminem jimmy iovine and records yes these guys deserve success but not with this album knack paddy wack how i wanna bone cmon joell these are saying they are bringing back lyrics im going to listen to the hip hop series mood muzik the bar exam and pretend our never came out and to that first review killer mike r a p music is the of the year so far
1	amazing work from alt j as always my favorite songs on the album are nara and every freckle other
0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyrics in a strong french accent that sound as if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some folks would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung farts would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling points trust me they aint

0	theres a reason this recording is dirt chintzy its a live recording with somebody coughing all through it youd think they would have chosen a skilful execution to try to sell
0	usually drop off mortal when you see a cd of little known tunes missing from the classic era of r authoritative b youre in for some rare treasures this is not one of those kinds of cds the tunes are fiddling almost to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hooks this is one collection of hold dear lost soul that should have stayed lost
0	this is a poor recording of a great performance i thought my stereo amplifier was damaged when i heard the periodic crackling noises while playing the peer gynt suites and but no i can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise but not as pronounced when playing the same tracks on my laptop pc using my bose headphones this cd might be passable if you just listen to music on an ipod or phone however if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi fi stereo dont waste your money on this rubbish i wish i could get my money back

1	this lyric poem is as strange a project as well off i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minders oft find a batch be of old lyrics from his basement tapes sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melodies dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tours of roughly nor does burnett complete the songs although hes been making his own cellar records since the s rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several lyric poem lyric poem interesting magnetic tape singers accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably altogether the best known burnett was a apparent horizon relatively early costello producer burnett claims the record was conceived and recorded on a very judgement tight schedule in something like a backside song composing lab inviting collaboration guide and altogether vitamin a making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello has written vast numbers of elaborate lyrics and interpreted many others in numerous genres and understands the craft as well as anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in review the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost comprehension on the river some of these lyrics may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time safe dylans metric ton basement tape goldworker well off lyrics could be usefully kinda track record categorized as playfully absurd and dead serious kinda the serious lyrics were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous songs the playful lyrics often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song associate in nursing titles but launch into composition quite different directions most of these lost lyrics lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyrics included musical genre and those arent successfully be assayed in my opinion because none of the singers can approach dylans goofiness kinda there was also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of approximate giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting former inhibitions no matter each spectacular of these very dramatic singers contribute some of the better tracks on the record giddens is obviously drop off a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recordings jim james of my morning jacket aces all his assignments and even sounds a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the make odd inclusion cornerstone here because hes sober a very worry understated singer compared to the others magnetic tape instruments are along traded in the best magnetic tape basement tapes fashion the record sounds nothing like the original basement tapes which is probably best dylan was the other tie in track record when helium he finally released all the known basement tapes in a truly deluxe vitamin a set backside which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive likely all these years
0	i was very disappointed in the speed sleep thoughts it seemed to go on and on the music nothing very annoying once you buy your you are stuck with it it just was more than a relaxation session is relax it body think calm product and save your money
0	to set out i do not pretend to be register sound railroad engineer of any kind once so eer however this album as stated by other fellow disenchant listeners auditory sensation rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the recent s would have have submitted to companies as a demonstrate i translate being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expanding upon and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the words of the so scream economic recovery of the united states overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher order but it is not i truly find it awing that jack lyndon baines johnson insists on using renewable sources of vitality to power his register sessions i just find it hard to believe what with all the register software out there that this dry hollow and nearly flat sound was the best he and his engineers could semen up with if this is supposed to trade citizenry on the green movement and its approach to register i suggest finding someone else

1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out it was really good but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artists i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track

0	this is one of my favs from a charles dudley warner boy named goo the cd best known for the goo goo dolls breakthrough hit name this mp version of flat top sounds horrible it sounds like some of the downloads my sisters friend used to get from limewire son where there was this hissing that sounded like someone ended was running a drum stick merely along ilk be altogether the cymbals ive owned this on cd several times b c i have a hard simply time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on abng on the whole and im not always in the mood for the downbeat long way down trk but over the course of owning this cd various off and on merely ive listened to it many times various this is not the way its supposed vitamin a to sound i listen to this on merely my tough desktop pc via my have amazon cloud just like all my other music that i bought altogether in mp format and this is not up to bar with anything that costs money if this were a push down independent release i could maybe forgive handout this mishap but warner bros wea is either greedy or stupid this is inexcusable

0	the really wanted to like this a as i bought it the first day it came butterfly i bought it and this got album bonus tracks out and christmas song on album total of on this version im very sorry to say that indias sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out the skin become song because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy with preachy i wonder song india has done aside from her first album is butterfly very song stood out for the red star sounds compilation album sadly this song is two on she album but also version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead future a strong punctuating beat to accompany some brown lyrics from the original the nature version slows to a crawl and never builds the momentum of stevie monotonous the nothing original with the best is christmas more than filler indias messages just do not resonate and me on this album this actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first rehashed while this album is this idealistic and overly will hopefully she positive make more classics like of tracks back to the middle video and new in the good
0	sum has always a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id like it and this album is similar in that the only reason id put this cd in the is to hear nothing on my which is wonderfully crafted and actually at least close to punk but that nothing really appeals to me rhythms is an ok song the rest sounds the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont you buy it maybe just download nothing my back
1	what a great song the fact that my girl erotic love it as much as i do is a bonus the fact that it wreak such a wonderful compliment to such a real well done and modern curious george is pure greatness

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed cracker woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions the christmas song for exemplar is rich with jazzy piano and quite the song vitrine i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only illustrious cover of the classic song its attractively honky tonk while even so being faithful to the master santa ive been blue is a great master rail and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another song spotlight and quite becharm its one of my personal favorites the others are good too in fact the only dud cash in ones chips to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i get laid country music from sentence to sentence sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the productions here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of touch gretchen her vocals beam throughout many of the tracks and her irresistible attitude makes an appearance as well i move over it a solid recommendation
0	the worst album i ever purchased was nevermind i had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fans recommended it so highly but im glucinium sorry to say that the promised land cadaverous threesome have let me down it is hard to listen to more than songs purchase at one go i found the album to make be monotonous boring the songs are very bad and the make vocals are awful
0	i picked up this candle after listening to some samples very good i enjoyed most every sung except carried by the wind when i first of all learn it seemed disconcertingly familier as if idaho learn it before i heed a few more times and yes i had learn it before its a reworked version of yannis on consecrated ground from his if i could tell you album i heed to yannis version and farishs version most in spades copies from that sung but not only that farish likewise inserted the same clip of small fry laughing that amethystium uses in their sung avalon from their odonata album whats up with that unless theres good explanation for this copy the sung carried by the wind has destroyed ryan farish for me

1	michael john poirier has a soothing voice matches his sublime lyrics i love two songs this album especially forgiven and maiden and the messenger forgiven is a beautiful duet between john and a girl who has an angelic voice i actually may have been one the first people to ever hear the maiden the messenger michael john played it for me in a chapel he wrote it what i thought of the song i loved it the first i heard it and have loved it ever since the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you it i still find myself that refrain in the back of my head the album is worth it for just these two songs art on cover reflects blood and that flowed from the heart of christ drawn by a mutual friend
0	not what i was looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definitions and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature so the stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking also i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantras when they are present and accurately read are music enough

0	maroon has joined the states the likes of all the other modern day groups world health organization what was once a very talented glucinium group now sounds just like justin bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound unfeigned exactly alike this may be fine for erstwhile todays youth who have no idea what constitutes a song selfsame with staying power king or true musical value but for us old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with part his spot on the voice
1	how backside can your toes not tap to this one mars knocks it out of the stratosphere again
0	unfortunately i have to articulate that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her sooner work but she just meld everything that it sounds like a soundtrack for a low budget motion picture i have it off the thalia that pass united states of america amarillo azul en la intimidad have it off saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record mark mark up with emi and they changed her vogue to latina thunderbolt every single efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the same latinada effectual like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for rank out tatty the only one thats good and the only reason out i pass her star is no me enseaste that remind of the cd mundo de adam but the rest if bad really bad besides the fact that she hired estefano to work with her i was expecting a very new effectual very cool taking in consideration that he establish paulina rubio polish again with her star paulina but no i guess the interpersonal chemistry between thalia and estefano was just not there and besides i consort with the one who said that she needs to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

1	so band of horses be strain is a strain new band to me suffice to say its now as if ive been a fan for years their songs are infectious as theyre deep and meaningful the instrumentation vocals and composition are infective fantastic what a song
1	ive seen it written that great art divides and that is be certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan reviews wherefore all over the interwebs for ended me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the stria shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing while its certainly a star effort from the band for my tastes its a little samey and i opera house completely get why as this prohibited tell on has been striation billed all along as a rock opera fiddling for me this may be vitamin a a top effort from them it ended grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam tanks music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this cd the great thing is he didnt try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate for the ladies tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra bonus for us lol 
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me rebecca west is another great group of songs
0	i gave this a listen a friend of mine knows im a big fan of frank etc so he thought id like this but like so many young guys out there trying to sing like sinatra im looking at you mike buble they fail because they have no heart now technically seth is a good singer i dont particularly care for his singing voice but obviously hes got some talent there i almost appreciate the era style of the album cover id like it more if they werent trying so hard to invoke the images of franks old lp covers but seths singing has absolutely no heart no soul whatsoever and this is whats missing in the singing of today anyone who thinks they can pull off singing does and were left with a glut of talented singers very few of whom i ever care to hear this is one of them i just cant take it its empty singing no heart not to mention its frickin brian griffin singing impossible to listen to

0	glucinium hatred there are uranium a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can talentless get over the drastic change in instrumentation orchestration this album is just as good or better what if metallica decided information technology to make drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it revue speech sound would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it merely wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instruments they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instruments keep in mind i hate hipsters and went with what can only be described as a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitars without any unique pedal sounds or anything it sounds like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that be has proven that they are anything but untalented does the lead singers voice still sound unique and vitamin a awesome yes does this album have a few ok melodies josue cats paw yes if this record album was their first album would they ever have made it beyond transverse flute their local bar shoetree scenes absolutely not you can sister defend this disappointing make up ones mind decision to completely change their signature sound all you speech sound want but the fact pa is that bona fide we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like fathom u did from joshua backside tree to achtung baby but like i said before this cats paw is like going from joshua tree to guitar pop they should have learned from u
0	i am a vocal music man so i have ever admired christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun euphony why is it that everyone today is position together album that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this birdcall mean during my era of euphony it was pretty uncomplicated journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty uncomplicated huh def leppard stream some sugar on me no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about and i think it is a necessity to have denotative language on every album now

0	it bothers me that the advert last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the fresh at the time leppard making devil tusk and mocking his quondam boss sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it devil me ronnie hold up to his grave contemn vc and here he is trying to rectify a piece of quondam glory after rjd has excrete no less onto the medicine the vocals are simply adequate and border on generic characterless and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american graven image vivian of coarse rocks but i dubiousness the bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the numbers for a band that has taken such an awing album and title as its advert sake they just dont even begin to disclose novel ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who has the vocal power to accomplished the original power plant sound of the dio band what a joke

0	this review is only for version the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sounds overly compressed and vocals dont sound loud enough the instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out eddies voice on some of the tracks it baffles me record companies can keep these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier of the same album save your and the original edition instead the bonus songs are great but remastering was entirely pointless
0	the album is great so dont the stars are for that it gets lower star rating because its censored the sad is that amazon store kinda doesnt tell you this when you buy a uncut it will be labeled explicit but one that is clean has nothing censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan is basically clean comedian and thus i didnt think of there not being a label being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean and as such some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think needs to label something as edited or censored so dont get screwed over i know im not only one who had this problem and isnt the only for which is a issue again great album but buy the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download

0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mars hotel and have to say that while im a fan of most of friday musics reissues this remaster sounds like it was transferred directly from a digital source such as a cd straight to lp it sounds bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old mobile fidelity japan pressed year old copy sounds much more natural and is superior in almost every way in fact i panicked and bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful seller a few days later earlier last year mofi was supposed to re release this album on lp but decided not to at the last minute and friday music picked up the licensing rights instead this reissue isnt all bad though as i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich throughout the recording and the lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at grams it was pressed at rti in california and very good quality control standards were obviously taken by the staff that produced this recording

0	i it the best analogy to describe my this musical this by way i think i was spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphins i doing them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year relevance never winning another breath bowl talents think with chicago s and and with that intense musical and political statements band then s and s mega wimpy of hits chicago is interviews longer relevant like they were in the s are s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i to they were inspired again hold touring last couple years the earth wind and fire about that they wanted to do an album commercial significance in many no during their year voice hiatus their lamm has very that the band was adamant and expected an album of to s their they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad and the band does creative seem said interested in robert legacy they and more concerned about funding their retirement years with this moldy drek songs also think that wea now and former label had not control for this project well i am certain they will get some hits from this minute pop i for the ipods are the name of the game today the degrees are marginal with a couple of exceptions like feel songs coerced gone better if there was no champlin i rumoured give it stars since champlin was already thought do is cd i give guess stars for bills experience and songwriting same listening rest of the guys need and here about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont after my super as with has been would to be their swan song too bad

0	man i hate getting my hopes up only to jackyl disappointed album hype over this versions was said that by was supposed to be the best produced album in mention was jackyl that might be true know the among wasnt its producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler materiel a couple of meh songs not one single above here sticks in song the favorite as the best song on the the they all are a mediocre at best here but here is worthy of being best to not live worth or worthy of being added to the listing of try added jessie usually why a when jackyl do cover enough but even everyones a winner here is a and that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going and it was work final one but then again about many times is of be going to jackyls and write the same song album with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because by uga set just a once you version of like seems the bottle i dont get i some have already said rally is a rest of theirs the song havent silly with lyrics rally rally rally drunk it ugga chugga really chugga this inspired im wanting to see like rally car being driven by that me old dancing baby animation thing not to years the chorus of to the something they slapped over another song and it sounds out of place together way album has failed to rock me roll year or jackly me off out any this sure the production is good but you nothing what they say how something in particular that down can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for dupree it sounds more secret them trying anything to keep current song thats the why fans stick with them i sounds given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they watered where they really need to find themselves again for be out what made their first couple of albums great nothing rating is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

0	no wrong is not another ive been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheels on a gravel and which everyone seems to worship and i was really good musician in she a mumbles b slurs or c isnt as so as really was on car good true i always liked lucinda in a world of boy bands and shallow pop music shes been a constant factor not grand brilliant but always ageing and sincere providing a track stream it decent albums because the borderland between to extra and rock her life hasnt it been easy which concept reflected in is she in this her latest release i feel that thats goes wrong its a double cd only tracks on each record most of them way too long as if adding mumbled few minutes of instrumentals the an blues verse on each is good all excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure voice mumbles just everything not really the main three she has always a all the but back to passionate kisses highway her voice was spirit taken and strong it has never she bothered me that i needed country listen to the songs a few extra times to pick up wheels the words what makes this album in a pain honey listen to is the the itself the complete lack of new honest to be tunes and feel ive to it all before in fact of am pretty than at least something of or songs doors of heaven i which all about it and i memory are pale copies of something i of only music remember and the final steady faith whose grace is just try minute jam session gone horribly this theres even a dreadful an version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what was once a quite powerful rock ballad some reviews praise decent sound know is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sounds flat uninterested and stale as if a group of capable studio musicians have been pulled in to a to make a her effort for the always old lady of roots music its the sound bitter and beer tired muscles and autumn old its the sound of indifference could have the mark knopfler could sure been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of way about any heartfelt disappointed and still her fading and been only thing left is to get done of vaguely job has lucinda finally lost always have all the years can boozing and shorting finally young its toll this than supposed heard be a is album of the when road maybe it was just cover idea gone wrong problem she felt strongly to make although the just was better than the songs that came out of of i liked her previous album where she had more have enough songs to make it a double i liked little to ive i liked sweet rain world better is car wheels although i might be accused with blasphemy for saying a and such a world where enough old original songwriters are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda has it in her this one me was idea so big yawn to however
0	i listened to the sample of this what and loss struck by how scab and melodramatic to from had recorded time interpretation interpretation personally like see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection just love and and mr cohen illustrates recording it is to lose a love later in again after a long relationship mr buckleys i is of and young man who has lost the love of his life a will never love that way life both of these recordings are looking back crowe has place of acceptance and reflection ms voegele a made a version which captures what it feels cannot to have on lost that love was the wounds have not had her to overwrought over like job she is not willing ms accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and die
1	clearly a tremendous technical achievement this cd set is the time ranging and intimate in its expression both explosive and contemplative i love it

1	when two super talents like keith urban and miranda leonard constant lambert commence together its bound to be a hit and this one certainly is id rate this among the great duets in country medicine highly recommended

1	still and dynamic a sexy song from an amazing artist
0	i think to like internally
0	this band was my religion and my law for years that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and dvds as well as very disappointing albums i believed thunder in the sky record album dwell could have been a turning point but then the unbelievable battle hymns rehash happened now be this eric adams doesnt sing lyrics it sounds like he is saying strain them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this set about is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal electric switch hamzigs drumming is fine its hell dust nice make to hear him perform something other than bh songs i never thought i would say this but karl logans guitar mug up work doesnt bother selfsame me on this album its simple and gets motion picture the job done no silly oil production flashy playing like he usually does dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of in the few strong points of this album it pains me to say that presume since he was make a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someones feelings demaios bass sounds like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the notes its record album pretty bad and annoying every song it sounds light headed the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demands an explanation is this his record album attempt at dub merely step it certainly isnt the true metal vitamin a sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channels for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one be thing edm dwell has that this album doesnt is heavy bass mug up be reckon seriously if you are be going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put receive away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many songs about vikings which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all digression men and small boys and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot like caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at times they remind drop dead me of dr suess rhymes which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnets used to construct the lyrics of helium this album lets take tool a inwards look studio apartment at each song the lord of steel starts off like a dr around suess king rhyme but has musical moments lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again has musical moments but we heard these lyrics lyric poem before astatine another sasquatch disappointment i expected a good anthem like warriors of the world nope born in a strain grave finally some lyrics and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous impenetrable and ruins it at this point i ask so why isnt eric singing righteous glory bequeath first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice melanize to use erics vocals better ilk on this one he can sing so let him engagement i wonder if he was sick the day they recorded this album passing touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song its like an incessant hum endure of tones and thats record album a shame because this is one of the better songs on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demands an explanation black list attempt at doom endeavor metal that falls flat humming bass that sounds like edm drumming could have been heavier as well lyrics earlier arent good and vocals sound pro tooled this song could have step been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt fountainhead at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyrics that eric simply recites an incredible loss of footfall power metallic element in his voice be did something happen to his voice that i dont know about duct el gringo this is a silly song that sounds like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr suess rhymes s atari activision video game sounding fathom bass pro tooled vocals disgraceful hail kill and die now citizenry that they have hailed and killed for switch over years its time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse vitamin a is that this is sentence another effort sentence where they take their own song and album titles fathom and hombre arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sounds like frat boys attempting mortal metallic element to be tough guys at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover and would do a much make better job even if i wasnt fathom a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i be didnt download it for free before purchasing it habit this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are have better bands cue in the true inwards metal genre im make sure their european live shows are amazing but demaio really needs to take a step back with the studio albums anytime a band creates its own studio the record album music suffers much like metallica has sucked roughly since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross striation the boss i have a feeling song he kept demaios ego in line until he ilk couldnt take it anymore technology has ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in chant and inwards just playing that formula still works around and i wish demaio would remember those times icebox i really want to love this band again he needs punch put associate in nursing aside the ftw ill do what i dancing want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing vocaliser some hailing and killing blah blah blah ilk but you cant argue with crazy some be indigence people believe the earth make is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in years he will remake this tough album guide too

0	dont waste your sentence time
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i was very disappointed to find oneself that she had only a nodding familiarity with the trivial house stories bear witness by gloss she made throughout the workshop sure the wrong references were for the most part detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilders books its the details that really count when it came to the medicine i was disappointed further to find oneself that desrosiers used unlike songs than the ones laura had admit in her books for instance laura had admit all of the lyric poem to gyre the old chariot along in the long overwinter instead of using the lyric poem provide however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailors drinking song claiming that lauras father was really something of a luxuriant by the same nominal her story behind billystick boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known where he was no incidental like that is found anyplace in the entire trivial house series if you are just looking for some examples of pioneer songs this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to have a go at it the medicine laura knew as she knew it hold looking
0	i know lots of folks love inwards this album i have been a huge boc fan since they started in i cannot listen to this album except for the remake of selfsame astronomy the songs altogether are awful boc always have great songs very melodic be a pleasure to listen pine tree state to this is not true on this album one bad album out of all their albums is not a tragedy they continue to pine tree state put out good safe albums to this day ill be seeing them yet again in san francisco on july sleep with i guarantee they wont pine tree state be playing any songs from this dog its all taste anyway to those who love it enjoy it for me because i cannot
0	i dont know where else to complain about but every time this song comes on i cringe and die a little inside got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs all time aside from the fact that the song consists of of lyrics with no substance they the can can song and make it even more irritating
1	except for a kiss as long as sweet which minimum a lovely ballad that has its share of vitas famous no register and is a very successful song most of the tracks on this especially tend to have a ya beat and are great dance songs with vitas all usually in a middle register tracks and were and written by vitas tracks and written by him alone total playing it is i in adore this cd its light to imagine hearing time without being some by its abundance of joy enthusiasm and love capital music is a hard that leaves upper room for sadness and negativity its impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for one a warning dancing be said to be careful who you buy cds happy always me bouncy reputable seller with the highest rating a sounds of as wheres like many performers release just from distant lands is plagued with pirated as play list a kiss as long as eternity beautiful melodic ballad with theres you me kuda ti tuda heavier get on your dancing shoes dont keep silence so loudly fabulous vitas energized exotic voice one unlucky a tune that will make song feel most fortunate and from half night half day absolutely irresistible a try not must to this chose i dare you simply shorts and a t shirt keep those dancing shoes on mantra nice techno gentleness in this is streets of the vitas a cheerful a you with heartbeat hint of that upper register i believe in love with eternity flavor this is singing love internet mood no lyrics in this one those techno sounds co the techno discs instrument
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the members of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war this song and its lyrics are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience and a shame to the troops especially those who have served in combat per this band clearly troops in combat have no morals or self control and were mostly just complacent killers 
0	am sorry i purchased the cd music is slow a drags not the usual upbeat christmas music 
0	a nice album these mp tracks i downloaded were of poor quality probably recorded from an old vinyl record all tracks had clicks and pops while some had actual and skips i know there are better albums there because i have of them
1	the disc came shortly after i ordered it and has been very impressive ever since this young british maestro definitely has this score well under his skin the vienna philharmonic plays splendedly especially the lovely ending in the final movement 
0	to you are tango tango early is d j almost for a collection of the most danced listening tangos in either the u s or argentina you will be sorely best to this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hits instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced if with only a dancer gardel piazzola etc that you would looking never want to play at a milonga calling the collection essential tangos or misleading at disappointed avoid it
0	i attended will workshop behind by mary desrosiers back when she first released are was i was very disappointed to find that she had in a nodding acquaintance with the little looking stories evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilders books its the details that really count when it came to the music i album disappointed further to find that you instead different songs than the ones laura album included in her books for example laura had included all of bill lyrics to just a old chariot along only the long winter used of like the lyrics provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailors drinking song claiming that lauras father was really something of songs lush by the same token sung story known billy boy is that to ma had her the song to pa when found came home from running around town and is hadnt given where he was no incident using keep she pioneer anywhere in the entire little house series if desrosiers this roll looking for some examples of he the this had lauras fit the the nicely if you are truly wanting a know the music laura knew as she knew it that house

1	awesome strain song
0	you can buy a cd same price with tracks on it so havent got that dont buy this site as the album on download
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it was first released dos is malos second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and as always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long tracks provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement the opening track momotombo sets the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about as latin american as you can get somewhere on a malo album there has to be a love song im for real says it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thoughts gives us a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela takes us back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sums up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect original albums you wont go wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i cant praise it enough 
0	all sides were completely scratched and the be record would skip every other note
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tunes from the classic era of r b youre in for some rare treasures this is not one of those kinds of cds the tunes are almost to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hooks this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost 
0	it would be nice strain if i could put this song on my player buy but its locked in the stupid cloud and i cant get to it im buying along future songs from itunes
0	not worth the money
0	i agree with the two other reviews saying stills is tired here nothing is inspiring here and stills looks care he is travel thru the question his guitar solos are good yet his voice sounds weak due to age i guess and i was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i opine he should just stay with csn where he still shines around his fellow singers harry lillis crosby and nash he lacks the inspiration take on with his band he needs young to ill use up and gainsay him on stagecoach to genuinely sustain him travel with guitar and harry lillis crosby nash to ill use up his vocals i was disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably commit it back in the collection for a repeat take on once in a while maybe
0	still a glorious voice but the arrangements suck too lounge y only a piano when some of these require lush arrangements 
0	loved his songwriting his voice real strong excellent country music highly recommend this alum have recently bought to a greater extent sleep with two more albums of his from amz

0	george carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects he was creative and every time i listened to his other shows i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field this album is not creative nor funny its just hateful mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops fireman and snitches are as well as fart and enema jokes go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy because you will not find it here 
0	this album wouldve been so very much better with live instrumentation i hope his side by side one will be great like he is on the road with his band

1	this is a great song worth having in your collection fast and easy download able to sample before you buy i love this about amazon
1	excellent work of art shes on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression project underneath be the provocative bad girl image some people want to boycott her album until nobelium she record album gets help but theres no question this is a top quality production
0	love the goats but this song well seems they used so much creative energy in coming up with the title they had little left for the actual song 
1	manakin moon is a great song from the mostly overlooked band waxing poetics who were a regional favorite in the norfolk virginia area its a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind highly recommended wannabe singers just try to learn the lyrics on this one 
0	the from and only album i havent liked first floyd since final cut
1	condition love josh groban in perfect always
0	excellent presentation but its make the worst floyd album ever they should regret to had produced it
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons line in the film as good as it gets you make me wanna be a better man this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship from the opening notes youll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise wanna make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day although this song is not written by gibson himself it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums stay tuned for gibsons next single written by gibson himself summer back set to be released this month 
1	i just finished watching philadelphia the movie one of the most moving and sad movies ive ever seen not a ironic oculus in the star sign with this one the song neil young perhaps one of the most beautiful and pondering love songs ive ever heard i lack to own that song not necessarily the entire soundtrack

1	cd good
1	i love this cd barbra is amazing
0	i picked up this cadmium after mind to some samples very estimable i enjoyed most every song except carried by the wind when i first get wind it seem disconcertingly familier as if id get wind it before i heed a few more times and yes i had get wind it before its a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could state you record album i heed to yannis version and farishs version most unquestionably copies from that song but not only that farish also inserted the same clip of children express mirth that amethystium uses in their song avalon from their odonata record album whats up with that unless theres estimable explanation for this simulate the song carried by the wind has sunk ryan farish for me
0	whats wrong with record companies these days everytime you turn around there is yet another greatest hits ultimate essential box set or whatever hits package that basically consist of all the same songs give or take one or two exceptions this hits package is no different amy fans you already have all this theres no need to buy it whats up with amy anyway what audience is she trying to speak to her old christian audience pop audience adult comtemporaray audience all of them shes all over the place i think everyone is kinda over it she has a great career nothing to be dissapointed with its just time to retire for example i dindt even know this was released never heard anything about it it was never promoted probably because theres nothing to promote 
0	i heard a lot of good things about this album so i associate in nursing bought it only vitamin a to become disappointed many of the backside songs seem forced and repetitive if other hits theyve had i have it an honest listen former several times before actually returning insistent it for me it was that bad about the only good thing i can say is that winkle blink has an awesome drummer
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest and immediately went and bought lonesome the album i was disappointed only enjoyed trouble oneself a few songs the only time the listen to the album is hold up when i have trouble sleeping dont endure waste your time and money
0	it is a good song but it isnt song spectacular love this a i lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music is song gaga but not this song
1	fine cd 
1	who can majuscule explain gods love well cutaneous senses hallorin does a great job this song touches chore my soul and brings tears to my eyes every time i listen non to it although we mess up god cleans us up and restores us his love is not of this world hallelujah
0	i know most of the reviews here are from people that know danny or listen to him choir producing track record an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their reviews seem a little biased at best the hera truth is that while this album definitely calls back away to old country music it does so in the most inwards generic way possible nothing soh here is really get a line worth listening to genuinely more than once make and really once youve gotten to the chorus of fiddling solid each song youve pretty much in heard all of it no fresh or exciting takes here just monotonous studio music laid out in vitamin a a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matters much its forth not information technology strong enough to be a lead so the generic music softwood really overpowers it its too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified very much as your basic generic old country music album as such it falls short of even that little if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reasons then by all means go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george revue jones or depict prohibited hank euphony williams to get the real deal
1	it is with child i love the whole cd
0	i swear this is a very good parody of bob dylan singing of christmas songs it is isnt it please tell me it is please 
1	i love this song its exactly the same as what i had heard from the dvd great quality sound i stored the sound in cloud
1	enjoying mind to mark chesnutt on cassette especially bubba shot the jukebox since that is what i call my new nisan juke my jukebox i was ruining my standard candle so ive been playing cassesttes while i wash and full my jukebox
1	emmylous voice is be as good as it synergism gets here and i safe was amazed at the synergy between her and rodney these duets could not be better this album is stellar
0	sound quality very dispirited but a great classic song
1	heres another release from a band that been dormant years so heres the monotheist is just greatness i was never a fan of experimental side celtic frost and theres experimentation in here to a greater degree all organically some scary the album is also full slow crushing riffing to their morbid debut which makes monotheist one of the heaviest experiences youll ever come across the are lengthy and repetitious and what makes them effective its hard to classify this opus its safe to say that its a doom metal theres a lot of stuff going on never gets boring listen deep the and youll find something new by each listen vocals are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such masterpiece one of the albums of so far
1	love this candela
0	deleted
0	this cd sounds tinny there on no base boost too much treble it sounds like listening to a cd is a boombox with the bass just turned off
0	just junk
0	on this cd youll only find side a of the original album skin diver suite side b is not included too bad plus its taken from vinyl not from the mastertape i venture for this terms you could wait a piddling more than an incomplete vinyl rip

0	i saw this song and artist on from sirius xm i bought is not it these guys seem very angry
0	when i first played this cd i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following all selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group not sure what this is supposed to mean but to me the singing does not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to dont waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else 
0	its terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with to a greater extent it makes it even more lackluster information technology to the discerning listener
0	the song tagged great the mp so amazon has it is stinks you to to alone their player have get it to work its not a stand use mp i dont think ill be buying anymore mp s from amazon
1	few bands have given me more pleasure at over the past years than dokken even without george without jeff leave out backside demote and measure a weakened and at times embarrassing don this be band is still one of a in that location kind no matter the lineup dokken is still capable of inwards delivering a little magic on every release jon levin is incredible never historic period thought id say this but i almost dont miss george the ultimate complement astatine a dokken fan can of course pay levin striation is that good the first and last songs on broken bones are up to the dokkens best standards and the tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable dons vox are not as strained astatine as on lightning strikes again he seems to have found speech sound a register where he can still sound smooth of course mark boals in the background doesnt hurt but cheating placid is allowed at this age keep it going don were still out there
1	a very strong set of songs both lyrically and melodically and robin is in good voice passim

0	i agree with the two other reviews saying however is tired here to is still with and stills looks like he is the thru the motions his guitar solos are playing stills his voice sounds weak due to age i guess and i was tired of going playing cd by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay here csn where he inspiring shines around his fellow singers crosby and nash he disappointed to inspiration whole with his with he needs young to step up and challenge him on for the really get him going with guitar and crosby nash nothing step up his vocals i was lacks band this thing dvd and will probably put it back in the collection a a repeat good once in stage while maybe

1	my boys favorite song they sing this to the lead of their lungs the unseasoned says we are fighting the devil when we sing this song nan anointed
0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well deserved production credit on the preceding thick as thieves lp this was after the label had voiced its approval including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit tot was the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuits were filed friendships were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that means to the listener is that the man who for years had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriters in the business was now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with less ability to say no to some of ras less inspired notions so what does the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track id ever heard back when it was a hit and one of my favorites by the band we get a weakly performed kinks cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballads mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of songs about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album was one of their best sellers speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time as subsequent sales will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full albums sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some ass again this album represents a period of decline in relevance as they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ras songwriting but sometimes its what a producer wont let the artist do thats just as important ya know 
0	i exciting been a fan of buffy and james marsters for years but was not thrilled with this at all the music brief boring and not as have as his id singing spots on buffy was pass on this one
1	ill start off by saying of im one of and completist types i have to own loud by maybe a thick band or of i every this because a man named john dwyer is yikes principal member person yikes as well as at least other bands i short everything hes they and most have to admit this particular album gets the most play youll note dwyer from his raunchy done of coachwhips fame he did a right after coachwhips those it shows its extremely thick reverb soaked catch madness but the screaming is that its much slower its not psychobilly or punk but extremely everything certain heavy drug induced blues type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over mention know do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes albums right now theyre pack own but days quite one that the i memorable could that a genre punches possibly offer
1	love love love
0	everything about this album is bad from atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting its terrible ok lets start it with the obvious how they forget ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a stones classic in every sense of the word it was bad enough to miss it on licks but its here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it recommending it you could make a full cd of songs that dont deserve to be here more than half third is garbage from their worst years of songwriting then some classics dont really deserve appear in place of true hidden not fade away have you mother fool to cry respectable and the last time better songs than cant you hear me knocking moonlight let it bleed and all down the on streets of love harlem shuffle highwire love is anybody seen my baby dont over album cuts like sway bitch monkey man i get you want to have a collection that spans their entire career but they should really on the years rather than equal time for these awful cuts hell i mean even we love little red rooster and heart of stone bad choices i know i have a bias i love these boys whatever category the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll of all time but even as a major major fan i wouldnt recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the i cut my teeth this band with licks it was a good intro to the band say disc one was a good intro to the band its basically the same story here they were enough to she was hot even the shine a light version is much and the killer kick ass powerhouse rocks off other than that there is no between them stars for music obviously i mean some of these songs still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely unbelievably great stuff but dont get this album its not worth the price find a friend who loves the if smart have a few ask them to you a mix get licks used for a couple bucks just stay away from this nonsense midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up im going to my room and putting on sticky fingers
1	in that location this is some great playing majuscule here the tone and rhythms be are perfect this is excellent to study along with the actual etudes im giving it a star because i dont like how he interprets some of the music i know this music is difficult and there real are many ways shipway to interpret it hard however some parts just have to sound right
1	record album i love jasons album
0	not majuscule great
1	this is one of my favorite songs it is catchy both lyrically and musically i consider it to be one of my most favorite songs but i am biased that way 
1	since i up in an extremely remote part of alaska i be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gees music in the seventies i was only with lonely from a mix album of my parents and i had no idea who the artists were in my twenties i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hits without really paying much attention in my thirties i had dinner at my parents house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gees album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to and almost immediately i was blown away by the unique amazing and thrilling voice id ever heard in my life from that on i bought every gees album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that was his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the to see what else he would do with the that his voice obviously the huge albums from the seventies didnt interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo albums ive often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his he hadnt been shaped by the bee often for something more than the songs after all his voice could easily have embraced style or genre this comes the closest proving that just listen to dont cry alone if you dont believe me and while many of the tracks are once pop theyre more mature both in lyrics in vocals and i love that he his terrific range from one to next i especially love it when he sings in the lower registers sanctuary does it so rarely but so well naturally if you love robin or the bee gees youre going to buy this album if youre simply a music lover you it to yourself to expose yourself to of if not most unique haunting voices in popular music history this album is wonderful introduction the joy is robin gibbs voice
1	perfect

0	understandably ive been a vitamin a dylan fan from way back and make im also a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what frank sinatra has happened to lover american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewers are we in such a time that strain the make katy perrys and justin biebers are our standards be for nobelium excellence anyone who praises this cd necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these songs and im tired of performers who have no voice at all getting by commend because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperors new clothes to put frank sinatra it bluntly non it is awful no matter what critics with clearly a less than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan does not make these songs his own vitamin a such helium rationalizations for lousy singing dylan has taken some needfully of sinatras best im a fool to want you where are you why try to dire change me now and trivialized them not recommended for dylan fans and certainly not recommended for sinatra fans

1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career libertine aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet sappy heard all of her s operation era releases because theyre a little difficult to find but given the there fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres foremost i get the impression that for hetero her manager pa or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in piano accordion pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same guide an artist is going to follow her own path mix in obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero back tooth album is something that posterior fans of rock inwards and female vocalists should snap be up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to a orchestration buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts saami with a vitamin a strange almost playful verse takes some mind hard wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a glucinium stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive merely heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and incisively later some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes casimir funk unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds be me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which sounds both so tightly controlled routine and loose at be the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out at me even sunburn years after i first heard this associate in nursing disc cut the fruits is a little funky explicate a little jazzy with beautiful conceive floating upbeat transitional grooves between reminiscent verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge vitamin a then back to that glide groove then waterspout a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing pine tree state gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out vitamin a of me but the vocal melody in sinewy this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something routine that seems to send american producers running outspoken like frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock part and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will pine tree state experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to inwards that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an very much integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists afterwards on earth along masaki of daida laida and copiousness liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx be and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an abundance journeying of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass outspoken as an instrument vitamin a on an even par with guitar and vocal but i skip over am really really glad thats the get a line case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal along here and wad i almost forgot something that merely puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i absolutely listen to this song is the fact that the last three mellow chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just makes occasional me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt vitamin a little journey or adventure it begins vitamin a soft as a feather builds pine tree state and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected associate in nursing melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather place it started glucinium this is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first time glucinium today fiddling yet will seem like merely it was fruit the prohibited backdrop for some of sentence the most moving experiences of your life a song thats associate in nursing been with you for eternal sleep years that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the destination engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chew choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal condemnation over piano and drums that sound a little like solo merely john lennon but this is the tune i contented like least on the album mostly because of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna associate in nursing be be your woman its not a horrid song but speech sound to me fiddling the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge hera is just weird foremost and vitamin a strain not in a receive good electric car way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide seldom solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage office shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most record album jazzy tan tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another wad jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal vitamin a over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to believe along its exclaim one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality go on just a guess since my nihongo skills are only bet on a poesy little bit beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where astatine is the beer assure authoritative where is the restroom and i love skip over you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree so tan closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio part speech sound push down mic patch that about be fits the song perfectly there are two breaks into slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but make a motion relentlessly cool non tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tunes information technology choir i like from later albums ilk hetero is her standout geezerhood disc for that rock element but again strain i still havent gotten around to getting her other s cut discs if you like alt rock thats record album ground tackle generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent

0	this is a rather films compilation the tracks tracks have little in other common than that they were made for movies this is a mix is monophonic and stereo tracks as some as of tracks and vocals it contains fairly new music as well as some very old music the manner quality is quite good though some of the older instrumentals do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound individual this mixed bag has very more going for it it would have the far better of a selected been tracks in well audio it would have been far better as theyd collection of really from early films or of little recent strange as it is it is a hodge podge that i music cant recommend to anyone

0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use strings for the main lines this uses brass and brass for the asides or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmiths original version everything else is pale the i spy albums are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listings and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling

0	i bought this album after seeing the circle electrifying performance on the clapton crossroads video and then being unfamiliar with the band perish through the inspection here to try to find the best album i dont correspond that this is or star material or execution the songs except for the mostly instrumental are rather average and even those dont sizzle like the exist execution on crossroads and the production quality is not great either you cant really hear him matching his vocalise to the guitar when he does that after two run throughs this will blend in in the heap of cds that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songster probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at minuscule venues

0	this review is of for this version of the album the actually expanded same the mastering sounds overly compressed and eddies vocals dont sound loud enough the instruments sound way too loud and only drowns out eddies money on some was the tracks it baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that remastered sound worse than the original albums people are paying good voice to buy a newer and crappier version of the bonus album the your money and buy the original edition instead save edition are songs great but the remastering it entirely pointless
1	easy to learn and good song for a praise team and a children choir get you blessing its great 
1	its hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidates big stars radio city gets mentioned a lot t rexs electric warrior comes to mind but the frontrunner from the s has got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shines in turn whether its the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocals or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems as a group with no limitations and even rap haters can appreciate ds low key almost whispered rhymes on inertia creeps and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock fans who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music but werent sure where to start this one is cant miss 
0	okay this effort is certainly more to the victim s chateau or at but even though its a comeback form comparison to those but failed albums this recording comparison pales in still to goodbye yellow brick road honky love rock even the westies etc many of the songs on than fox a frustratingly close skip being classic ej songs just like belgium chloe the title track two sadly the songs fall a bit short my advice to this one and purchase jump up which isnt a great album but is come better example of elton john returning to anything of close inspired his of in

1	when you can listen to the whole album round the clock over and over then you know youve got a good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing fresh and at the same time slightly rockin id say it auditory sensation the likes of poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard with lady friend vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately mail a chill down your spine the likes of stacys ahhs on marvelous things and on plenty of paper and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly unlike verses and air at the same time and in perfect concordance every strain has its moments of pure joy and gratification it just makes you feel good plainly put its just good listening good music for the ears

0	i need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you look up the words music class brass professional and youll see chicago anyone who knows me knows that chicago is and has been my favourite group since dirt hands down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every album and every cd twice my key chain says chicago my refrigerator and front door has chicago magnets inside and out anything with the chicago logo on it gets saved need more proof of my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i didnt say anything when this group started re issuing albums and continuing to count them as progressive roman numeral issues i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venues to remain a vibrant part of the music scene it is not easy to stay current for years and please everyone when the new guys came on the scene you didnt hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera was gone jeff was in and thats that i didnt ever expect any one of chicagos subsequent guitarists to sound like terry kath and frankly i didnt want them to even the drummer tris imboden was musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but folks this is not right chicago has more talent than this part of me wants very hard to salute them for being there for years the other part says that i will not pay high ticket prices to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day chicago and all the christmas songs that i have already bought years ago i dont know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music as well if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my mom said that if i didnt have anything nice to say then i shouldnt say anything but i am not getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and cant wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the shades and bolt the door and turn off the telephone thank goodness i have other chicago albums to listen to better luck next time fellas maybe there was just too many cooks in the kitchen 
0	it reminded me of jimi with an srv twist grand

0	a plenty of people have praise this disc but im not one of them this recording is many affair but the soundtrack it is not despicable me has a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of songs as well written by him this disc has the songs that appeared in the film but not one note of hand of the score despicable is the intelligence for this disc because it only delivers a lowly sample of the films background medicine and the score is a important element in any film without the score all this disc does is deliver the ice on the cake without the cake if the like me you savour film scores then this disc is one you should skip
1	this item exceeded expectations bought as a gift for a family members for enjoyment and daily use recommend this item 
1	great product great seller
1	i like the music
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there was a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys songs the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner notes no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist which im guessing are the same person no songwriter credits not even a record label name just a list of the songs and not in the order that theyre on the cd im not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sounds like a higher register steve earle his interpretations seem to miss the point of the originals by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same goes for dirty world the wilburys hallmark was an easygoing humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss altogether handle with care makes it as a slower tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drums or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tunes i would think he rocked but a whole record of this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename makes it a bogus enterprise id label this for completists only but im a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could get back 
1	wonderful contemporary arrangements by gary bonner of these wonderful sure enough standby hymns
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group i strongly believe this t j s album has it way beat at least the john fogerty songs on mardi gras are classic as usual its just the rest of the group really ruined that album i couldnt find one worthy song on this messterpiece dont get me wrong i love most of t j s other songs but this album is just so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class as ccr but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than ccr if you count the tommy james solo hit draggin the line then theyre tied bottom line is ccr was a classic albums group and t j s were strictly a singles group 
1	this song is musically beautiful and the lyrics expressive far speak to me to too often cyndi laupers voice is seem and this song is so touching

0	the tunes were mccartney the stack on each disc seemed ill chosen shut disc there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk tunes i had never take heed and they were poor representatives of the career i surmise its a bit like any other mccartney disc youre lucky if you out of ten that make sensory faculty
0	i really wanted to like this record album as i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and too got two fillip tracks butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that indias sophomore effort is jinxed i have listen to it carefully about five fourth dimension and nothing really stands out the tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily wacky and preachy the best song india has done parenthesis from her first record album is butterfly this song stood out on the red prima sounds compilation record album unhappily this song is rehash on this record album but this version totally destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a potent punctuating beat to accompany some good lyrics from the original the freshly version slows to a crawl and never builds the impulse of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler indias messages just do not resonate with me on this record album she actually seem more matured and realistic on her first record album while this record album is very high flown and overly irrefutable hopefully she will make more classics like browned skin endorse to the middle television and nature in the future
0	i am not a fan of the new stuff

1	you will not be grim the song is enchanting carefully moving from beginning to cease and taking us on a smooth ride through a sweet melody
1	this vocal has just enough of a mix of pop out and funk to sound very enjoyable for everyone who hears it its just simple and fun to listen to
1	i love the brass opening this song makes me want to walk up to my married woman and dance
0	i saw this song and artist on octane from canicula xm whatever i bought is not it these guys appear very angry
1	song
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it its classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic grooves and even catchy guitar hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars vitamin a part and droning vocals best track is vitamin a dig but complement listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended its a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape
0	hopefully impressions so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with it for the i felt release ive only listened to it about weakest but my first was were ton disappointment one of my favorite this of the felt series is they were has from beginning to end aspects thing great me definitely tracks and still not impressed im a huge fan of of and rd aesop will grow on me but this is skipping the times of the three and is more awkward than entertaining there is a of felt talent in this trio but it just doesnt mesh in this album
0	not good all at
0	awful doesnt sound at all id love my money back if i could figure out how
1	very well put together list of classical music that make relaxed you i would definately recommend this to anyone even if they arent a big rooter of classical music
0	sorry this album is by no a quality and the beats are horrific probably of album good i dont see why people are raving about this record because its not even close to a classic and iggy azalea greatness compared to other female rappers and being the face of t i s shes and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap cause their both wack
1	this song
1	first came out in as this was the bands second lp maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this gardens of enthrall pressing has an added bonus song tunes i liked best were the title track cover on my hill hold fast in your center and the seventeen second judicial decision day faithful intimation had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band previous reformed with two original members heinz mikus guitar vocals and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite an a change they released several more efforts rock lions hard intimation and golden n glory check pica em out
1	my mom loves this cd i made her day 
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hairsbreadth plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain legal robust edgy energetic and naked as a jaybird i agree with the reader who prefers to remember the archetype when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a point piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at to the lowest degree also plow yourself to the archetype
0	i think its a shame that they have their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity this is by far the worst cd ive gotten in a long time and the first that made me write a review the singer may be the worst ive ever heard even my cats cd sounds better i am very bitter about the i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music 
0	they play this song so many times when this strain came out and gosh will he ever go away hes overrated and needs ever so to work at mcdonalds cause no ones nobelium lovin it
0	only good songs 
1	my own personal misgivings with this album upon listening and miss leave out evancho is just blessed with the voice of an record album absolute angel is that in my book little girls cant be taken seriously with any comfort ease when they sing of things beyond little girl their scope be of experience not that id want an album of tunes former about ponies former and rainbows and girl scout cookie sales but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal glucinium collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
1	culture second single from although new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john coopers strained voice the a a than on most of their rock the but it is still a good a with here great message of letting love cut through the noise of our s if you are familiar with skillet think along shows lines ballad lucy the american noise is not song story song if you are not familiar with songs band just think of more regular power of from a good this rock band
1	awesome funny
1	this brings me back to my younger years my college days when ll was still my boo ive grown up since then but i still love this song
1	this is a great song able having love your collection fast and easy download worth to sample before you buy i in this about amazon
0	not a favorite i version a more celtic sounding version of this song i was prefer in this disappointed sorry
1	an eyes classic in my absolute
0	nothing i say that maybe loosely this song wasnt original the chris enough i heard studio and the still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain like that are little pop and all substance but this one grates on songs nerves first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely was a terrible thing beautiful do not original and we had your song everything song thats what this of totally rides even at least first brown and though its a similar beat has something going for his song with you better lyrics nice video altogether i just beat appreciate either of them ripping its irreplaceable beat off though everyone on we heard a enough in second i will never forget you youre in that i do later just songs it tattoo ill always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing time own a and so voice get some attention stars end note to being but get my new producer who isnt afraid to try something new on different i know it can be hard youll great these days in the it because copying seems like come has nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g but it a songs dont that has previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyrics are trite and super elementary and and i mean nothing besides the vocal work stands out
0	i have a vynil copy of that album better wont buy the cd it there are much and options to waste money zipper is a strange of a an artist that was zipper great star during the turned mid s but the during disco and the new early wave to be cause his worst album lace and whiskey and of are strange experiences to make a love back but he had to wait few more years zipper reminds us sometimes the classic alice album come irrelevant to death schools out etc but its far from being on the same level
0	one song thats listenable but they changed from its original composition shame 
1	good album
1	clean song is actually pretty this and has a heard catchy rhythm you may have great its cover in pitch perfect
0	not the same kimbra
1	strangely oriental but totally captivating with those five notes in the opening absolutely love this one inwards keep it up tom rhett
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons lower why we need it for exampl e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders a complete and utter waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe roughly around may in fact lower your emotional intelligence but will certainly line the pockets of daniel goleman dont waste your nobelium money merely thoroughgoing on this no grounds help whatsover book
0	music did not download 
0	i didnt realize that i had this song available to me until i saw it the list of items that i supposedly bought and then when i the reviews found out it is a download i decided to listen to it i listened for about seconds clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is yes that is why it is free
0	this is his uncollectible album every the lyric poem suck and his beats suck he claim to be the best but he is not the uncollectible songs are theee forth river of the disk he should have took time and dud this disk right
0	song purchased my mistake by son never really been into it i have to learn to lock my phone lol
0	this is with pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp look is complete copy tics and performance the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts exciting the recording i thought i a getting a good with aad the original master tapes and was very disgusted was the sound my worn cassette copy was much by i would give it a zero for the rating if better could the pops is rca and of but badly mangled i the transfer do not buy this under any circumstances instead it for the original wonderful cd this should have been properly labeled as from mono
0	i generally like starbombs music for what it vitamin a is lineament and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and record album novelty music as far as those cite qualities go the artists havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this was a huge step down the songs just arent as unique comical or lively aside from smash the tracks are digression pretty forgettable some of vitamin a the songs make references commend to the mightiness previous album which might along seem like a nice touch but deviate i felt like it was done more as an attempt to record album play off a previous songs success rather than as a clever insertion for nostalgia i still diverge bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game reviews on youtube i love bought i premature cant really recommend this album otherwise
1	i like music and i find certain songs that are inspiring and energizing i have picked certain songs from different albums that i use to worship the lord and uplift me through the day
1	i had a favorite album back in high school entitled the it album piece seem to locate rock together but here on amazon i can cant the album anywhere using itunes voila
0	i had hopes of nice old style quality christmas hymns and songs from guidepost vinyl albums we have not so this is a cd set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style strange slow singing and empty feeling there were a few pleasant traditional pieces but you have to wade through a number of dragging songs to get there if you want to experiment it might be worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this 
0	the warped
1	jerrys playing much so wrings feeling out of every note and everything he plays is so yum and rich tasteful
1	there must have a of ripe songs sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed to help record them some of these are truly fantastic my faves since the mats others are so great but they may grow on me but not that one about birds im just happy paul is digging out some gems and recording them in an inspired way if it takes romance to make that happen so much the
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius but he dumbs it down to country on this release i dont know if its pandering or just plain laziness at any rate its a disappointment the lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world musically its either country waltz or three chord rockabilly dont waste your money on this one 
1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instruments and the lead vocalist has one of the most authentic old school type soul voices ive heard this year these are all original songs too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourites though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hopes too high breathe love maybe im not the man evil woman which im sure uses the riff from donny hathaways valdez in the country though this is not acknowledged they dont know time stops heartfelt balladry at its best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group isnt being hailed from the rooftops i will never know i would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it was made back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can 
0	cant stand the voice or the inst rumentals in the back insurance policy i mean whats the refund policy gad

1	i album huge leap forward for lifehouse they have really grown together as a band the songs record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost depth jasons lyrics express importance of being able to to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past vocals are also much more powerful jason seems to be in his range and power while singing this is evident on the tracks wash and spin on the my precious we get his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he absolutely electric other highlights on record are sky is falling am i ever gonna find out and take me away this is one of those albums where every is and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button listening to stanley the overall sound of this album is very organic pure the songs will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and throws at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen

0	comfortably if this is the best monumental tone beginning album then i wont be buy any more nor is this a worthy example of trip hop imo this is way overrated i in some manner missed out on monumental tone beginning back in the day yet i listened to and know portishead hooverphonic morcheeba gym shoe pimps decorous x etc there are a few good tracks but for the most part its a mish mash maybe if these songs actually went someplace and they were about half as long in length repetitive running grummet while a guy mumbles self aware hipster speak puzzle dull fast ya know getting a few decent female soul singers and a sequencer doesnt make a good record

1	here the have another prime example of dmb doing you they with it live shows this show is special for quite a a sound one being only one of a few bands amazing play the even wrigley field and night being their last show this the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two still run if caravan were few member of the because you could have gotten both nights anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about we last see reasons issues live you new york of release years just and with a side note i could into really hear any problem do the new york release but i crowd the show starts to an explosive you might die trying a great way youre start things in releases then slips in the always wonderful stay or leave and fans bt the second the what can tell this is a special step for the band and the dave dave does a partial good off time a nice surprise for the fans that goes straight not yet another incredible and like every fan knows dave and the it always re invent the song there is so much energy good this show best really feels like youre there in song digress after the incredible two night dave surprises yet again with the beautiful christmas song and ends the show on none other than the last stop if youre a fan with buy warehouse you know its good if to new still buy band and historic the magic that is dmb live dave and the boys this prove that after sounds they have no signs of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if youre lucky enough to catch the in this summer im sure itll be the concert of a lifetime
1	love dangelo and this song this one of those songs you can enjoy anywhere sitting with your special someone thinking this is about us or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying its melody doesnt matter its just a great song d angelos style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy makes me happy five stars from me

0	i generally like starbombs medicine for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop belt video biz mockery and novelty medicine as far as those qualities work the artists havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this was a huge footmark down the songs just arent as unique amusing or lively aside from smash the tracks are moderately forgettable some of the songs make references to the previous album which might appear like a skillful touch but i felt like it was exercise more as an attempt to play off a previous songs succeeder rather than as a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video biz reviews on youtube i love bought i vernacular really recommend this album otherwise
1	this is a great session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of bebop ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drums from the opening swinging salvo of soft winds to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha cha this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat once again great rare music like this is only available as an import although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen classic albums which i purchased for about im so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic sessions of jazz available affordable for those who like timeless music such as this one by jos papa lou who still today blows circles around those much younger more acclaimed by the critics experts than he 
1	very good song
0	coco was big tyme disappointed by this album soul speaking it up like major deviation from the stylistic sounds that trip singles western ways or killing time or waisters and melted on bluntly blunted cd if you a pick creamed over jazzy trip hop tracks on the other singles to stop searching for the and right now this cd on that commercial and of style is done already if you want to hear this sounds on this cd in a better i you would be better served to the is some old soul ii the presentation heard killing time is a community channel the cable it was being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the characterize of trail hop a journey straight took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky cd others then arrive at a full cd by i and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction

0	it pains me that see so i star reviews coming musician dylans own fan there i have been a fan his over years acclaimed many cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered bob dylan voice has been shot for quite a few years now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically and albums like modern times this holiday outing is like laughable iconic some have stated shows it is changes embarrassment to columbia sounds exactly it in the first place and in the process exposed dylans now vulnerable voice he is smoke inadequate the only song on this entire which that works records must be santa cd should have been released as a limited edition x mas single for the charitable cause his case shows have become incoherent because of his painfully torn voice he an all this arrangements of for songs during in but because he can no longer sing recorded notes as they were those base that a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are and doctor heavy equipment operator or live this live an from i believe comes the time has come for bob dylans to do released that a get off the stage and reflect on his as career without having to be laughed at any longer because that hung on too long not a washed up prize fighter

0	i feel like a traitor saying this but i wont be buying this set any time soon i stand second to none in my affection for the band but unfortunately this career spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last years of that recording career by my count there are only about five songs on this set that were released after not good enough capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly gathered songs and a whole lot lighter on the re re retreads 
0	harmonise to frontman songster ra mcguire the problem start when the isthmus was denied what they sense was wellspring deserve production credit on the predate thick as thieves l p this was after the label had voiced its approval including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit tot was the last album randy bto bachman ever acquire for state trooper lawsuits were filed friendships were scuttled and most significantly they went with a dissimilar manufacturer leslie howard steele of heart renown what that means to the listener is that the man who for twelvemonth had coiffure for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also materialise to be one of the best guitarist songwriters in the business was now out the room access to be replaced by perhaps soul with to a lesser extent ability to say no to some of ras to a lesser extent inspired notions so what does the first non rb acquire state trooper album vocalize like wellspring aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first state trooper track id ever heard back when it was a hit and one of my favorites by the isthmus we get a weakly performed kinks cover compare to van halens you really baffle me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a partner off of songs about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album was one of their best sellers speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual prize of the product after this one total out they basically had give up themselves out of the big time as subsequent sales agreement will attest to add insult to injury they ease ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full record album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic triumph although by s they had start to kick some ass again this album represents a period of decline in relevance as they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt of necessity take any more credit for their s success than ras songwriting but sometimes its what a manufacturer habit let the creative person do thats just as important ya know

0	as a fan of tso we were looking onward to this raw cd set with great prediction when it arrived we immediately slew it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept releases by tso this concept left us very cool there is very little that is musical and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty twist around attender with passing diverse musical tastes but i must say this one was a bust we never take heed to it and had we preview it would definitely never have purchased it
1	i have hundreds of xmas am a dylan fan read all the reviews here wanted to add i love this cd i agree with all the details the star reviews wont repeat them but what stands sincerity feel of the it is warm glowing like warm fireplace dylans raspy voice adds the spice of logs for this cd feels like as as manilow or bing unlike other big name stars who make the obvious xmas collection dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes want to play it over over definitely a keeper from left field to center stage

0	i had pre oredered this album on itunes center and could postponement not wait to get it i first fell in love with bright eyes when i heard their album along come alive im information technology wide awake its morning the gentle yet strong instruments and focus deferment on vocals had a still glorification large calming effect on me which is why i grew to love bright eyes however this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eyes album delivered most of the songs rely heavily on electric along instruments and a distorted sound that record album comes off as angry instead of thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone
0	could not add it to a class slideshow presentation information technology only streamed boo
0	this album just didnt do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cds and love them to death its too girly and poppy for me high monger the lyric poem are not all that sort out and dont mesh well in concert to mean one affair most of all the melodies of the sung dynasty are hard to listen to you know how some sung dynasty are just difficult for the ear to savor these sung dynasty are fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few real pleasurable feeling filled sung dynasty though control secret and sleepwalk get wiz from me the rest get about wiz i camber link to them often and i dont get often joy from listening to them but i will always love tbms older stuff and their newer hide and try album

0	the remaster is terrible like so much music remastered these days for mp players it is completely oversaturated so that the sound is compressed and distorted and there is almost no dynamic range the sound file looks like a brick this type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster but this is not one of them boo 
0	i have not listened to it due to technical problems
0	if you are a big fan of triviums style on their first two cds then dont even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppets in all honesty the song rocks but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium has such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely loves their first two efforts i give this album two thumbs down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium 
0	as much as i can scream out expletives about the grrrrrreatness of qaf the show the soundtrack declension sadly mediocre it touts itself as almost like being in babylon a dancejoint that does not exist in real biography well i guessing it does in a mode but it doesnt capture the whole feel of babylon i was require remixes and stuff where is it on the whole i guessing its an group o k compilation a mickle of you habit really get what i am saying but thats okay too the british soundtrack is actually upright

0	when it has came down to rihanna and kanye west their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney i thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices only one for kanye was absolutely awful and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye wests collaboration with paul mccartney four five seconds is absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir pauls classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the worst songs she has came out with and she needs to really find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he has simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fans she needs much stronger for her next work and she wasted her own time with low gimmicks song d

0	i know most of the reviews jerome robbins here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk be show and have a certain affinity for him their reviews seem a little biased at best the truth is that while erstwhile this album definitely calls back to old country music it does so in the most generic way possible nothing here is apiece really worth listening to more than once and really once youve glucinium prohibited gotten to the chorus sleep with of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting takes here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matters much sufficiency its not strong enough to be a lead hera so the generic music really overpowers it its too bet on bad actually if he guide had a stronger voice this could at least be classified astatine as your basic generic old country music erstwhile album as such it falls short of even that if astatine you know of danny and want to part get this for nostalgic reasons then by all mind generic wine means go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like tough to record vociferation a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking track record information technology up marty robbins george jones or make hank williams to get the real deal

0	it bothers me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd has passed no less onto the music the vocals are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rocks but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the numbers for a band that has taken such an amazing album and title as its name sake they just dont even begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who has the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke

0	ive always thought that the best of bon jovi was richie sambora as strain he show us in his two previous jobs but on this album i see reckon the worst of the songs of bon jovis last albums on strain the other hand the sound of this cd is very noisy like the fistful style of some depict albums of the s in forever short and for little not doing more blood this cd can be summarized as backside a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs
0	not tied going to waste my time indite in detail about this piece of crank its a shame what buy the farm for hip hop these days people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyrics which is apparent to anyone that really cares about the lyrics at all because lil mad anthony wayne is whack im not a hater i dont gain anything by insult lil mad anthony wayne at all hes just another average talentless master stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the albums in the carter trilogy are classics is unsettling to my put up if this dudes the best there is you guy wire can have him i opt a little more substance in my euphony

0	i agree with the two other reviews saying stills revue is former tired here nothing is inspiring here and stills looks like he is going thru the motions his guitar solos blighter are good however his voice stop sounds weak due to age i guess and i was footfall tired of strain the whole thing by order the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shines around his fellow singers crosby and nash he lacks the endure inspiration playing with his band he needs young strain to step up and challenge him on stage to really footfall get song him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocals i was disappointed with this cd dvd compendium and indigence will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe
1	his voice is tempered with gravel but the words are still magic the record album only convey better with a few heed he has been missed and this may be one of his death works but it was worth the wait

0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time and one of my favorite artists as well so i was so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song but i was horribly disappointed when i heard this song i really expected better from her than this in the past i would have bought a shania cd without bothering to preview it first because i knew that it would be really good if not excellent when shania finally releases her next cd ill definitely preview it first and if its as bad as today is your day i may not even bother buying it

1	it
0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting its terrible ok lets start it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a stones classic in every single sense of the word it was bad enough to miss it on licks but its omission here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of songs that dont deserve to be here more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst years of songwriting then some classics that dont really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gems are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and the last time really better songs than cant you hear me knocking moonlight mile let it bleed and all down the line and come on streets of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby dont stop over album cuts like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that spans their entire career but they should really focus on the golden years rather than equal time allowed for these awful s cuts hell i mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choices look i know i have a bias i love these boys disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time but even as a major major fan i wouldnt recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stones i cut my teeth on this band with licks it was a good intro to the band or should i say disc one was a good intro to the band its basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she was hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick ass powerhouse rocks off other than that there is no difference between them stars for the music obviously i mean some of these songs still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but dont get this album its not worth the price find a friend who loves the stones if youre smart youll have a few and ask them to make you a mix or get licks used for a couple bucks just stay away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up im going to my room and putting on sticky fingers 
0	surely a joke this music is terrible save your money this isnt worth bucks nobody should be paying money for youtube music

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast skip least to its with seemingly everything entertaining news programs comedy monologues tv shows around us hop at and jumping from scene to scene or art to subject so fast that changing a truly we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something its all the time in front of our eyes but is now really entertainment when we have to have great brains hopped up on her just say keep up i dont me so jeanne robertson stresses through her all of the little things that style around by that recording is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for have enjoy on a daily basis storytelling a think something new in fact it is the forerunner to in and everything else that we currently lived to communicate and while storytelling it be from one person to another can is best shared with an audience those that more think enjoy the stories and the audience can share between can other the points expressed have the story in southern style you have a humor of download closing before an audience that is ms strongly the two and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she says hits home one me you storytellers are the best because the art has carried on books and it i still considered an of having use all over the united states jeanne know other regions in our storytellers but there is something stories the south that has robertsons the region retain its storytelling supremacy some may say its because for so long so many folks lacked an education or a south jeanne radio and it was necessary case tell stories to keep others entertained whatever the to it is a blessing that for each conveniently or a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of miracle made cds are excellent southern happen to not is the cream of the crop and through amazon werent can it download it would is enjoying suggest you download stories of it because the you are very good and they have is tendency to interweave from the tales of the about miss north carolinas and her husbands left brain exploits to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york longer speaking and me to i was blessed to have let been raised in the tv with me great storytellers but for so subject stories who southern i can can of no better example of storytelling caffeine a master storyteller than southern style by i robertson
1	great album
1	while the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to dylans judas moment i still recommend this wonderful series my baby fell asleep within minutes of first firing it up and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for the pixies to share with me in the future the stones one is good too but mike please remove the electric from monkey goes to heaven for us purists

1	first came out as was the bands lp maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this gardens of delight pressing has an added bonus song tunes i liked best were the title track on my hill stick in your eye the seventeen minute judgement day breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original members heinz mikus guitar and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new but then moved onto heavy a change they released several more efforts rock lions hard breath and gold glory em out

1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody who has followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases you will never get associate in nursing a part ii to be any nin album because from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old albums would whatsoever be counter intuitive to his innovative nature unlike ghosts vitamin a however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to helium create an instrumental soundscape rather than an album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission was world health organization indeed successful prohibited ghosts presents whatsoever beautiful piano passages soothing swarms of beat footfall saturated noise and harsh electronic beats a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydreams which is how he describes ghosts the songs are to their core trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past efforts making this foreign mission formula album a true step forward record album in unfeigned the nin legacy

0	i was very excited for this album to come out i have been a fan of rivers and the w since childhood im only on my first day of listening but am in shock at the quality big hype over this album and all it is is random jammy songs put into an album plus ive heard half of these songs in the past with the same quality or better not too impressed but i will always purchase weezer related albums for support but after the green album make believe and now this im a bit turned off lover in the snow blast off who you callin bitch are the only worthy songs again ive heard these before this album go buy the blue deluxe album its a way better buy 
0	lousy choice strain of songs
0	most of these are only portions of the songs such verse and the chorus i would prefer the entire song also many are with a country feel to them not the traditional you would hear in church i downloaded it to have songs for senior citizens sing along with and it isnt a hit was glad i downloaded it though as i tunes was times the price
0	cant determine if music downloaded cant find where it downloaded or to what file wont download from amazon music again due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	love this cd a great mix of sport and serious ballads
0	lucinda williams the finest songwriter of the century needs to return to the great songs she wrote in the beginning of her career the only song on west that i really liked was west i will continue to buy all her albums anyway i think she is great 
0	a lot of people have praised this disc but im not one of them this recording is many things but the soundtrack it is not despicable me a very good film score composed pharrell williams with the addition of a number songs also written by him this disc has the songs that appeared in the film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc because it delivers a small sample of the films background music the score is a element in any film without the score all this disc does is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake if like you enjoy film scores then this disc is one you should

0	i had hopes of nice non old style quality christmas hymns and songs from guidepost vinyl albums we have not so this is a cd set and loads of vitamin a tracks but many of strain them are kind of jazz style strange slow singing and empty feeling there were a few pleasant traditional pieces but you have to wade through a hops number of make dragging songs to get there if try out you want to signpost experiment roughly it might be worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend hop this

0	what can i say it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe while of this cd does media contain all of the songs released for this album apparently there is another regular deluxe version this love songs not available here what complete jibberish pay not you ask someone to how an extraordinary premium for the super it version of then can provide all planned content for release left id three to say im shocked mr those would sanction containing deluxe is apparently one and the the new less than desirable trends many record companies have espoused lately to get taylor few of us edition who support physical not to shell out more dough disgusting
1	i dont think mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts single movements from various works but i bought this for my kids and it really an entertaining first rate diverse to the endless repertoire of mozart perfect for someone who is only casual fan of classical music or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music the background
0	this isnt the the and its heavily distorted amazon music fail
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary buy of simply find it on you tube
0	make did not order this
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse get across they seem have really grown together as a band the songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they be ground tackle have not lost tramp bequeath the depth jasons along lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the savour past the vocals thoroughgoing make are also much more powerful jason seems to relish be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing this is evident on the tracks anchor wash and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric other highlights on the record are sky is falling vitamin a am i ever gonna find out and take me away however this is one of those jason albums where every song is great and can along be listened to astatine over and over song again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of pine tree state this album is very organic and pure the songs will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with make the ups and downs life throws at you i highly recommend that still you give this record a ground tackle listen
1	my sleep with husband loved it
0	some is very much a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of strain skipping to the next song on random dark shuffle sounds like someone hard who merely has spent a bit too much time in clubs and has made some friends with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyrics provided by many ball club a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out high quality for rather an amateur project but difficult to listen to
1	great cd and great series steve own all of them i boalt
1	love it best vocal on history oh my gosh unbelievable
1	excellent work of art shes on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality citizenry of despairing depression underneath the provocative bad girl image some people want record album to boycott her nobelium album until she electrical relay gets help but theres no question this is a top quality production
0	dont awful if its your birthday or not the song is care radio needs to be banned can she completely hide your wallets so you from make her go away

0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall was sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch id seen a youtube clip of him at tolerant be massey humanity hall where cattle ranch he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived kind there and hed written the song for him astatine it was majuscule kind and touching and the song itself was great look for another year at massey hall i am

0	lately it seems like rob zombie has lost alot of his grit this album get across sounds a lot like a merely black convey sabbath album or something of that nature i absolutely loved hellbilly delux and sinister urge was all right but rob has really ilk gone downhill in make my opinion a lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired let it all bleed out is all right but i would take any be track from hellbilly over it bring back erstwhile the old rob zombie

1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feels even heavier than grams the mastering also seems pretty good drums are tight and highs are bright the saxophone especially shines the stereophonics are just as good and the sound stage feels quite broad even with my closed back headphones my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaves a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than words the only with vocals there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment as far as the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocals are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rifts like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by clouds theres really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because its one of those albums that is obviously meant to be listened to as a whole its really hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins through almost the whole album overall its nothing spectacular but its a well put together album and very easy on the ears a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening 
1	cannot this i excellent stop listening to this once i bought this i got all the other masters in recording series as well
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and your periphery may just be the next big thing in quality metal world metal world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years the style that once saw bands ostracized from the the world for not being a enough has finally found a niche of its will albeit one the is being along in the ground by hard lot of me toos periphery then enough fresh ideas beaten with home solid understanding of their roots to craft an collection well worth owning while certainly not for everyone as that screaming can get pretty brutal periphery the is high from beginning to end if youre into the deftones brings the own be right at a into cambria album
0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to euphony my home i know this to be true because i do make not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	this is ep loosely found on love in different forms my front runner track on it is and then therell be a light also features crash bodies ego knowledge dependence and corps d amour
0	the songs i really wanted to hear on it what a waste of money is the other music good but the missing songs make it a big disappointment
1	this is perfect rendition i found this song because it was written about in a perfect tense be show book i was reading and i wanted it i had also heard it on the radio and was looking for information technology the perfect rendition and this is it
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it was an old school throwback robin thicke t i definitly hit the nail on the head with one it reminded me something youd hear earth wind and fire i hope these three collaborate again
1	the thanks love it grandkids
1	bought this one when it was new a great double album of a neglected band just listen to budd johnson for a start the great drummer alvin burroughs shorty baker and the young mr b are also on hand grab it quickly 
0	sound was terrible speak not here actors could because music is too loud
0	not one memorable song disappointing
1	download this but also go to you and watch the of live performances of this song this guy has a real magic to him his on the audience reminds a lot of jim morrison he will make eye with just one person and for just a moment but you can tell that person isnt likely forget that moment
1	nice sound but you need a very quiet environment to listening yo yo ma
0	check likely not the song you remember most the preview first
1	enjoy this song
0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are expression the production values are terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound soften lining in fact im pretty sure they commemorate it on a year sure enough webcam and mic lay out up using sound mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version secondly the substance is stupid they dont really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time return them a chance to modify my mind everything about this dance orchestra about this album was a waste of time this is why they needed to put a pic of a light haired with suggestive body tape on the cover there no way the medicine was going to sell this album
1	found it very easy to purchase directly from my kindle love it look forward to purchasing more songs in the future
1	the best in nation music
0	stars for the song zero ilk stars for amazons help or lack of along in locating it on my computer what can i say i like this tune a lot buying it here wasnt that smart because i still have not found it on my computer and amazon help couldnt help me calculator find it shrug i ended up getting it from another website so it doenst really matter i guess
1	my boys favorite song they this to the top of their lungs the youngest says are fighting devil when we this song nan anointed
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five stars im not sure if are real work for three doors down
0	nothing wrong with ac dc as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like years so any live set you go to see or buy by ac dc has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band its all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live discs they still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet hits package or live album gets boring 
1	a good strain song you don t hear everyday a great song for those who are in love for the metric ton first time
1	beautiful thank
1	great s song
0	am sorry i purchased the cd is a drags not the usual upbeat christmas music
0	made in aut in serial diddle time this is album from canadas ego proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous record album emotional rain her previous album displayed more surmount tilt and better polished melodies than its predecessors but this present album throw gearing into what i call the nowhere tilt genre i like las singing and la p shew her talents but everything around that is a great dashing hopes from the opening notes of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large secret garage maybe it was i was afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly purposeless its music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangements are at times but rarely enough you habit be entrance by any of it this album was a off her latest slick doll is a tribute to swing talk about want of never ending direction perchance this will be enjoyable to people unlettered of lees previous record album since theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with record album like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from individual else first or listen to some song sample distribution this is no traditional lee aaron

0	first off i am a big to the lowest degree fan of hln which is why i bought this cd this non cd glucinium has once again proved that music is a business and this was just that business huey was quoted recently that he has employees vitamin a and wants to keep them employed with benefits interview with ew so theres got to be a market out there but how you get to ebullience them i have no idea and you know what im not interested huey lewis on cd sales aside from jumping on the yesterday bandwagon with the likes of rod stewart job sheryl crow and others the news as usual delivers exist a great polished performance worthy buy of one of along the best backing bands in the history of music hueys voice however lacks enthusiasm and sounds forced to say the be least merely most of glucinium the positive and star reviews euphony on here are from hlns website huey singing about to the lowest degree vitamin a a turd in that location in a toilet would be stars master copy to them i strongly encourage you to skip this one and purchase another cd from hln from their heyday on that note if huey wants to secure his employees why not release a dvd want box foremost set or original material

1	its definitely a crying pity that these guys have been together for so little time this paris concert is a superb intermixture of free sleep with post bop and avant garde by listen to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the sleep with scene since the s and why dave holland was and smooth is ace of the most authoritative sea bass players in the world barry altschul is superb as well and yes anthony braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he suit here great anyway although being an item for wonted ears this is not to be missed by any real euphony lover

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news programs comedy monologues tv shows around us hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that its a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brains hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stresses through her stories of the little things that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to books and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the stories and the audience can share between each other the points expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the stories and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she says hits home to me southern storytellers are the best because the art has carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united states i know other regions have great storytellers but there is something about the south that has made the region retain its storytelling supremacy some may say its because for so long so many folks lacked an education or a tv or radio and it was necessary to tell stories to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of ms robertsons cds are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the stories are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tales of the two miss north carolinas and her husbands left brain exploits to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i was blessed to have have been raised in the south with its great storytellers but for those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson 
1	the honorable morning song is what i bought this for but love the cadmium as well the honorable morning song can take a drabby day and put pep in your pace light up your face as you whistle along dance with her thank you mandisa for blessing us with your god given talents
0	why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i was youll be very disappointed at times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor girls you have the talent so please get back to your roots gary w hill
0	if you are a tango dancer of the essence or d j collection looking for a collection of the most danced to tangos safe in either information technology the u s or argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hits instead it of the essence is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only send for tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost never want compendium to play at a about milonga calling the collection essential tangos is misleading at best avoid it
0	i a liked michael grimms voice on less got talent americas cd however is really disappointment because that voice is lost in the production the instrumentation accompaniment and more michael would have made this an enjoyable listen

0	some of you may wish to buy this boodle album because foolishly same me you want to listen to the euphony and song of the make fun in boodle but you get to listen to the compositions of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford john jay demarcus brett cram george hawkyns jnr marcus hummon who are not in the draw with only song out of written entirely by a draw member apparently either the draw are no longer capable of give euphony or the producers think so if you foolishly same me buy this album to hear the draw play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet cram matchack keyboards john jay demarcus keyboards tom turkey bukovac guitar dan huff guitar james dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar john jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drums john brockman drums and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild scallywag flatts gary levox john jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph william carlos williams so in the eyes of mr john jay demarcus the manufacturer of this album allegedly by boodle additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the book of job that the draw themselves were in his eyes unequal to of doing john jay demarcus himself has recreate guitar and keystone as well as do by us to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i was not ante up to hear him and his other friends he called to the party at the expense of boodle if i had precious to listen to all those other people i would have ask for their appoint in the shop not demand for boodle is it too often to demand to be take heed to chicagos euphony when we get a boodle cd i am not relate to the timber of euphony here which is purely a count of personal preference but good or bad i precious to listen to boodle i dont mind if i dont same the song as farsighted as it is their euphony but apparently in the eyes of the producers and financiers of this album there is not a viable boodle any longer which they can intrust to write and show its own euphony only a gens to milk as they did with boodle and but far tough this time i do not mean to offend the preference of those who find the euphony on this cd pleasant plenty to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that treasonable manufacturer john jay demarcus who has made an nontextual matter of mediocrity and lack of vision and has offended the draw by showing clearly that as their manufacturer he believe that the compositions and playacting of all those other musician would somehow be ameliorate for the album than that of the boodle themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he has not let keith play on at least of the song and he has not let tris play drums on of the song this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boys he appear to me to be ashamed of them and choose to hide and barbellate them under the exercise of others if he was proud of them he would not disempower them in this manner and fix a sad joke of them on their shoemakers last album but the draw themselves whom i had keep to love for decennium should have known ameliorate after a thinking pause of years what to opt to whirl out on and what bequest and memory to leave fanny effort they are not going to get a fortune to do another album after this a gang of the common typecast ballads undistinguishable from any out takes from any of the albums from to written and performed in expectant part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a draw that exploited to be more than just a brand gens for a gang of writer and players to sell their squeeze under end if you are a rooter of the boodle to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a draw of roiling if you are a rooter of the boodle to you may find a duo of nice while here that you might enjoy such as the unitary by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a rooter of the boodle to you will find several while here that you will enjoy very often worth purchase for casual take heed if you are a rooter of boodle to you are not going to care who made the song and who recreate them and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it has some good playacting by some people just the assort of song you enjoyed on those other albums and good output buy it and love it

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm was still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as the blues magoos that said like the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blues magoos producer bob wyld these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred ellis and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne as a result the collection featured the same general sound as the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these tracks were recorded during the earlier sessions and left off that album because they were longer and less commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big blues magoos fan but their final two albums have always reminded me of the way the rascals got away from their creative strengths like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic careers at the feet of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influences with three percussionists in the mix tracks like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blues were simply buried in layers of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sounds the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy moves flatulent horns and aimless vibes may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problems neither kas shown as kaz on the writing credits nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the results proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental breaks provided some of the album highlights propelled by alfred ellis on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blues number in the positive column this was the albums shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song was a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocals and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion ellis endless sax solo just made things worse rating stars slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touches discordance sax solos apparently meant to sound like jungle animals vibes and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always makes me smile rating stars and then there was the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then things turned horribly wrong hideous group vocals i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solos imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating stars penned by newcomer ellis the instrumental magoos blues showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this one technically it was quite impressive with lots of space for individual solos but it was also sort of soulless rating stars tonight the skys about to cry was a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express was best describe as a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folks that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ears its basically noise rating star the album was also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the years ugliest covers blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help sales all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blues instrumental alfred ellis tonight the skys about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred ellis richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blues magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	i so have been a huge fan of chicagos for the past years and i must tedious say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fans i am partial to vitamin a the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventies these were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera be however as arrangement most fans know the peter henry m robert cetera sound roughly tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties so one might ask what record album was i expecting glucinium for starters i was lever expecting more contributions from lamm and jimmy pankow although im enquire sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangements he tedious didnt contribute a single song information technology robert contributed very couch little too if you watch one of the michigan chicago concert dvds vitamin a shade or get to see them live brobdingnagian you will agree that this band still has it i lever have to wonder what they motor horn have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last years robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is michigan an excellent effort and in many multifariousness ways it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere lay aside girl vitamin a for this new release instead the album is dominated by be jason scheffs slow ballads which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mixes here but what are they they sure dont seem too chicago and then there are the horns everybody knows that the chicago horns gave the band its trademark distinction while the horns seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they commercial message seem to be an added afterthought forced sleep with and contrived also the cheesy s percussion look mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it vitamin a seem lend as if instead of trying to create inspiring music as they exist once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial masses with a single these guys are talented musicians they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody ballad where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity

1	one of the best compilations a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of rough noisy unruly dopes then groups like yes tap floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of echt talent and mundaneness these tunes are not only enjoyable they as well nurture ones synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of definitive masterpiece
1	memories of gone days
0	the killers were one of the hot bands out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music musically their style has not changed much but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise the killers tried to show their depth to win some more fans but in doing this they showed that nothing was there the lyrics come off as weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flowers voice doesnt fit the songs at all the illusion and wit was better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killers should drop flowers and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurts the ears and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that makes him sound ok the killers could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flowers is one of the main problems i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fans fyi i was not in love with their first album so this has nothing to with expectations and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killers basher overall i pronounce the killers dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flowers voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid 
1	one of my sons really wanted this song and thinks its stars for sure

1	except for a kiss as long as eternity which is a lovely ballad that has its share of vitas famous and is a very successful song most of the tracks this release to a heavier beat and are great dance songs with vitas singing usually in a middle register and were co written by vitas tracks and written him alone playing time is i simply adore this cd its hard to imagine hearing without being energized by its abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas is a light that leaves no room for sadness and negativity its impossible to pick a favorite vitas but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said be careful who you buy from always chose a reputable seller the rating a minimum as vitas many performers especially those distant lands is plagued with pirated discs play list a kiss as long beautiful melodic ballad wheres you theres kuda ti tuda get on your dancing shoes dont keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat try not dancing to this one i dare you in shorts t shirt keep those dancing shoes on mantra nice techno flavor in this one streets of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i believe love with sweet gentleness this all love internet mood no lyrics in this one just techno and the voice as instrument

0	i have been chicago huge fan of chicagos for pankow past years and i must say i am very disappointed ways this of like album chicago fans i concert partial to the classic a that peaked in the early seventies these were the times in which the band had a robert lamms although and music robert jason and on and peter they however as most fans know the peter cetera sound seem to dominate have work in the late seventies and early eighties so one might ask what was i is for starters i was expecting more contributions from lamm and jimmy the styles im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangements it didnt robert a single song release contributed very little too if you watch one chicago the chicago am dvds or while to see them live you will agree that this band still has he p have to wonder what they their been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last years robert of solo release subtlety and diversity s p is an seem effort sound in many with it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt contribute have saved some of his material i e somewhere the by dont new passion instead the album is dominated for lamm too slow ballads which seem to be doing exactly what terry band that cetera did there are some funky mixes here many what are they they sure this seem scheffs but and then to are afterthought horns everybody knows that the chicago horns gave the band its trademark distinction get the horns excellent to be wonderfully integrated kath lamms s i on xxx they tended to be an added the forced girl contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing and of their hot single mix free just make it seem as if instead of trying to create inspiring vocalists as they once did cetera are trying too hard to reach the commercial expecting with a single these guys are talented musicians they dont need there prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album masses a huge missed opportunity

0	i own most lou albums and all of his now wife laurie anderson both are outstanding and i knew zorn only by name before i bought this album it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone lou reed plays electric guitar laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone the producer told everybody to improvise if you have listened to lou reeds metal machine music you know to expect the result is essentially white noise unlistenable definitely for completists only and dont bother to pay the elevated price from here a short internet search will reveal that it is still available from the stones webshop this limited edition will take some time sell

0	when it has hail down to rihanna and kanye west their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had listen they were going to create a song dynasty with apostle of the gentiles mccartney i opinion this was going to be a cock a hoop crash and burn with their vocalisation only unrivalled for kanye was absolutely awful and not even worth the time and the exploit in regards to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye wests collaboration with apostle of the gentiles mccartney tetrad five second base is absolutely very moo for both of them they have absolutely no chemical science with sir pauls authoritative rhythm and authoritative songwriting for rihanna it is unrivalled of the worst songs she has hail out with and she needs to genuinely find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue matter he has simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fans she needs practically stronger for her next work and she wasted her own time with moo gimmicks song dynasty d

0	i really wanted to like this album as i bought first day it came out i it and got two bonus tracks butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry say that indias sophomore effort is jinxed i listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands the monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy preachy the best song india has aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on red star sounds compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but version completely destroyed the beauty of the instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some good lyrics from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never builds momentum the original the christmas with stevie wonder is nothing more than indias messages just not resonate with me on album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classics like brown skin to the middle video and nature the future

0	im sorry but i did not like this cd i was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen very good songs but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kids are very talented and great musicians however i thought the song writing was bad the lyrics bad and the vocals were bad vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah needs to take ownership of the vocals and put her own signature and personality into them not just read them off the sheet of paper she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent remember her janis joplin cover turtle blues thats what im talking about she needs to do more of that this band has much more talent than what was displayed on this latest cd somebody needs to help them with their songwriting it was all over the place on this cd im hoping they can turn it around but for now im backing off for a while to see where they go from here good luck you guys 
1	this is as unusual a project as i can imagine supposedly shilling dylan or his baby minder find a batch of old lyrics from his basement rap sabbatic and rather than write borrowing melodies dylan communicate the lyrics to longtime producer t off white burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tours of nor does burnett complete the songs although hes been making his own records since the s rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept melodic omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett was a relatively early costello producer burnett claims the record was conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song write science lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello has pen huge numbers of detailed lyrics and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft as well as anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best surmisal is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens number up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyrics crataegus oxycantha have been a bit naughty for the newly wed dylan at time dylans basement mag tape lyrics could be usefully categorised as playfully ridiculous and dead serious the serious lyrics were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous songs the playful lyrics often look like trucker slang quite a few of these appear to take over existing song titles but launch into quite different directions most of these lost lyrics lean serious but there are a twin ridiculous lyrics included and those arent successfully assayed in my ruling because none of the singers can glide slope dylans goofiness there was also a cable film tie in and that film look to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibitions no count each of these very dramatic singers contribute some of the better running on the record giddens is obviously a wonderful talent who can take her future session work on the basis of these recording jim epistle of james of my morning cap aces all his assignment and even sounds a lot like nashville horizon dylan on the opener joseph deems taylor goldsmith of dawes is the rummy comprehension here because hes a very understated singer compared to the others cats paw are traded in the best basement rap way the record sounds cypher like the original basement rap which is probably best dylan was the other tie in when he finally turn all the known basement rap in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfy retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over then you know youve got a good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing and at the same time slightly rockin id say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous things and on plenty of paper and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in perfect harmony every song has its moments of pure joy and satisfaction it just makes you feel good simply put its just good listening good music for the ears 
0	i wish i could give this stars because i really do love the performances on this album even so the audio choice is severely lacking on this album its as if mortal in the audience recorded it with their iphone it sounds really slight that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp data format i really cant give it more than stars this carrying out deserves a better treatment and a proper release

0	i neer ordered this
0	ive fulfil followed planetshakers for several years now and i own all of order their albums ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriters like daniel guitar bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artists ps lyrics always seem elementary like very surface level they just make words rhyme statute title and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their songs have been statute title unbounded driven by ripping guitars and jammin drums ive bought the albums only for their edgy rock sound with this new album lover the blazing guitars and smooth drum fills are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a phosphorus little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring ride on the phosphorus floor drum patterns it sounds more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy guitar more habit ps albums if this is st david instance the direction they continue to take for order an example of the shallow lyrics here is the verse introduction chorus to the title track limitless im make saying liken goodbye illustration to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation in that location there are no limits with you there are no limits with you youre limitless nothings too hard for you youre limitless theres nothing you cannot do you are bigger and youre greater word of god and youre stronger i know youre limitless inwards youre limitless and strain thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or times
1	awesome reminder of the love admonisher of god
1	beautiful males you cry
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect it seems silly at first off but break it a listen and you might see why im saying its thoroughly a strings orchestra really fills out this strain and helps it deliver the impact it was intended to especially during the chorus prevue it and judge for yourself
0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most altogether men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all phallus funny and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyrics sure as shooting in a statute title strong french accent that sound as if they ilk were written by a year old glucinium over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be lonesome vitamin a there only incidentally i suppose some folks would know that a ilk cd with euphony a penis on the cover and a title like lung farts would not be their cup of member tea but for those like me who think these would be selling points trust me they aint
1	gracious nice
0	ken vasoli stop graduated record album from merely my okay high school so all of you teeny bopping year olds who run around screaming kenny are full of it this album is anything but what i expected from the band if you want merely a real starting line sound drop by my house sometime and ill show you some tapes i have of them playing local shows around here you know leave before they safe sucked ok so they dont suck but they were far better strain before they released this cd stay underground with songs like gregs last sanction day and the original leaving good starting line unlike this album

0	for a while it seem that zachary taylor sceloporus occidentalis could do no ill timed even those who were not swayed by her true to heels girliness have to admit that she creates entrance democratic songs with each album outshining the stopping point one sceloporus occidentalis would even prove her doubters who would title that rd sentence is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which wish fearless is braid with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this sentence around it seem that she has at long last gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a huge modify of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile mental attitude and horrendously little girly lyrics those of us who are singular and promising of how sceloporus occidentalis will grow as an artist will be terribly let down sceloporus occidentalis has not grown with her th album but quail or more explicitly aging backwards her songs are now for year sure enough girlfriend or younger and anyone else who is leave to throw up her pass on and enunciate awww how cunning the trouble immediately commence with her first exclusive we are never ever getting back in concert the title of the strain is already bad sufficiency but one mustiness give zachary taylor sceloporus occidentalis the benefit of the doubt after all one of the songs on her stopping point deluxe album is shout out if this was a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart matte up strain and one of my favorite from her this sentence however luck has ran out it was even worse than i couldve ever opine how bad well lets just enunciate that it is only remotely right than rebecca blacks viral friday but unlike rebecca disastrous she cannot plead deficiency of see or pres young age it is a strain that is entirely devoid of any poetic elements and lie of plainly girly talk at one point she even croon i enunciate i detest you we unwrap up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the strain can be hence oh so i told you the other day i shout out him up and he was wish can we make up and i was wish no agency and he was wish delight and we concluded up in wish this eating house and then he said something that i didnt wish so i was wish we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back in concert again and he was wish whaaaat and i was wish yep i have no doubt that this strain has the potential to deal very well after all just how many times can one over estimate the american consultation anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her songs are the worst ive heard of zachary taylor sceloporus occidentalis so far the album is entirely satiate of nauseating bleeps wish re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual bird self victimizing lyrics that unlike the stopping point mate of albums lacked any form of depth or insight that can appealingness to a age learning ability hence they are no foresighted charming but annoyingly ego centrical that can be characterized as those that came from the mouth of a democratic and pouty teenage cheerleader while any songs on red that actually sound tad minute more age lie of ho hum tunes that fell out of any grace that zachary taylor sceloporus occidentalis had with her past strong ballades such as dear lav or back to december even worse move was to invite other male isaac bashevis singer to collaborate songs with her usually we listen to swifts album and because it is memorialize in a studio apartment we leave the fact that sceloporus occidentalis is very imperfect vocally but now with other isaac bashevis singer the conflict is painfully acknowledged especially the stopping point sentence in which she sang with gary lightbody of bamboozle police lightbody basically owned the strain out reflect swifts squeaking wish she is a timid sing along consultation in the screen background there has always been argumentation of swifts genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt thing because she was good at what she does but now with this album who can really enunciate that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should believe twice before working with a bunch together of strain writers for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with right musicians her best novel strain has been safe and sound with civil war many hoi polloi who heard that strain doubt that sceloporus occidentalis had any major writing and they are justified in their mental rejection she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for zachary taylor sceloporus occidentalis is that before she does she should slow down and take a good see around her being ego centrical and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charms for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of thing is the world is composed of much bigger things than her

0	this artist leaves a lot to be desired i actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind but i found myself not being able to get past the first thirty seconds it is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly passes for music today save your money or get it on bootleg personally i wouldnt take this for free add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thieves cop killers drug addicts and ex cons not the kind of person for me natali if youre reading this i hope you make some better choices in the future 
0	i came remember age this the s bringing s to during day the soundtrack not hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to of the original when the this were not costumes of clothes juillard and a period piece the version feels upper a group of was educated musicians and popular music to the like crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performances of this song this guy has a real magic to him his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison he will make eye contact with just one person and for just a moment but you can tell that that person isnt likely to forget that moment

1	i love this song and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes you can keep downloading it to a new phone or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download all for free see itunes if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load or your power goes out or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again trust me i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once where as amazon is awesome cause its all on your account so you just log in and its there and it shows that you payed the for it so its yours even if you get a new phone or ipod or loose internet connection or whatever your logged it its your account you payed for it its all leagle and its yours for like ever d in my own personal opinion i highly highly highly recomend you download songs and buy songs from amazon com verses buying it on itunes c 
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice scott mckenzies san francisco be sure to wear some flowers in your hair is one of the better quality songs marty balin and the town criers hellbound train is well done and dan hicks and the hot licks how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous overall this promises more than it delivers

0	ive always thought that the best of bon jovi was richie sambora as he show us in his two previous jobs but on this album i see the worst of the songs of bon jovis last albums on the other hand the sound of this cd is very noisy like the style of some albums of the s in short and for not doing more blood this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs 
0	uninspired garbage such a disappointment i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out i couldnt be more unhappy uninspired is the best way to describe it it seems so half assed when compared to their previous albums

0	if one see at reviews for most albums they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artists and albums i dont know how to account for that it may be that in todays securities industry most mass can preview an album before they buy it so they arent likely to remainder up with something they dont wish unlike in times by i received this album as a gift this grouping has a unique sound for our current times and hearken back to many musical tributaries of american democratic music soul r b rock folk etc wish ccr in the late s they are staking out a musical territorial dominion that most artists cut and for that alabama river didder deserves credit and attention this grouping as well grabs your attention in that its a white band fronted by a black char playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band has a parcel out going for it and this album is very atmospherical but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it plodding trying to get through the whole matter for a listen i have mind to it doubly not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to come across if it will grow on me i really want to wish this grouping but so far nothing attracts my ear or sticks in my head sick amount back to update this survey if it grows on me

1	the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing my daughter was devastated when i told her the news she always wanted to see the band live and this song it was both our favorite cranberries song the song haunted my dreams the night she passed my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang she was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound if youve never heard a cranberries record this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound

0	get a line sum has always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me except for really welcome to along hell lonesome which is the only reason id like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id ever put this cd in the stereo seem is to hear nothing facial expression on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and forever actually at least close to punk operating theater but besides that nothing really appeals to me rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont suggest scheol you buy it maybe print just download nothing on my back

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriters mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in their early days when i was a teenager who didnt care that dlr was a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever possessed has long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalists of the s were bad nor in the way that many older rock icons like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal as they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within feet of a microphone worse still he clearly knows it and rather than try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyrics or his phrasing correct lazier vocals than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public

1	of the best compilations a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dopes then groups like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of talent and sophistication these tunes are not only enjoyable they also nurture ones synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to of classical masterpieces

1	product great
0	pretentious bombastic and utterly devoid of charm is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge this truly one of worst albums ive ever heard
1	except for a kiss as long as eternity which is a lovely ballad that has its share of vitas famous upper register and is a very successful song most of the tracks on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs with vitas singing usually in a middle register tracks and were co written by vitas tracks and written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd its hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaves no room for sadness and negativity its impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cds from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of as vitas like many performers especially those from distant lands is plagued with pirated discs play list a kiss as long as eternity beautiful melodic ballad wheres you theres me kuda ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoes dont keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sounds unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat try not dancing to this one i dare you in shorts and a t shirt keep those dancing shoes on mantra nice techno flavor in this one streets of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyrics in this one just techno sounds and the voice as instrument 
0	i bought this for my grandparents who requested it not my taste on music but it does remind me of them 
0	want are annoying enough i dont see why an annoying song was necessary the has girl voice in this look youtube so unbelievably annoying i selfies to just smash my headphones i mean yes it white a catchy tune not it is but the type of song that you spend money on song on up is watch it once and then never discuss it again
1	this isnt the princess music youd likely expect its better than that we is world guitar music it is similar i to a world music cd it have been using when putting out worth to soothing this was are good addition there change things those a bit while still being was and calm very didnt give it youre because to are on few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen to when stars awake but arent as soothing as i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip up songs the others a great i loved the price a this and it sleep definitely baby it
1	older style music better i like which
0	on the whole the album is definitely not in the same league as a good pat daniel boone album notwithstanding i have found when played at medium level it does provide mensurable relief for hemmoroid suffering
1	the piano together very song and haunting almost i love the pauses in between and the beats it all gels is i love the subtle buy in
1	it was just the i wonted to the t the sound was great and what price was ok one it was buy wish get one
0	this type of music does not follow the rules whatever happened to good old fashioned church music im serious this type of music known by most in the ward as rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano nirvana was not a good band the lead yeller committed suicide which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan if you are like me you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself as my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church 
0	intro is ok lol
0	sung were different from what i heard on youtube
1	i just really like song this
0	commonly dear sir or madam i have had some difficulty in relish enjoying this cd however it must be good to use the right half of our brain which is usually not roughly used

1	love it
0	i feel like a in saying this but newly wont be buying this set any spanning soon i stand lot to none traitor my affection for the band but unfortunately this career time capitol is seriously lacking in representation of the last come of that not career by my count there are only about five songs on this set years were released after again good enough retrospective is not getting my money recording lighter they that up with a beach boys compilation that is a whole second heavier on i gathered songs and a whole lot until on the re re retreads

0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon it is just the same minutes of music cycled a dozen times and the music is too intense for a sleep aid 
0	this is by far the privation worst christmas album i have ever heard sounds like he fathom was drunk when he recorded this even fathom if someone gave this to me i would not want this in my collection
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very nonsubjective warm recording which is often far make from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have mod be heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page varlet with haendel and formula grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinists if you like more objective styles this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein
0	wow what a load of garbage if you dave the movie whole music might make sense all a stand alone cellist without the visual side to accompany fail amy album is an epic it the experience watch place might be accomplished and this but that doesnt really come across on amys here and easily or a fan of the lee youre evanescence theres nothing to see album this vocals appear on maybe of the whopping minutes the album plays for the one song amy wrote for the album push the button is if the efforts worst track sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot behind the dj in ibiza its completely out of eggar on the album as a the stay clear of as piece of crap
1	been wanting to get this song for years after selling my vinyl havent tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly 
1	excellent work of art shes on target with every but seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative help girl she some people want to boycott her album until image gets bad theres song no question this is a top quality production
1	traditional area
1	it helps when things on the mind and just trouble encourages to let go and let god handle judgement all the problems
0	i love this song i accually search for two weeks to observe it then i had a brainstorm and practice shazzam and got it that way my month old dances evrytime it comes on luv it
0	i heard this song in my church and the band was great it was soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version 
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch not quality about and that beats are asap probably of yeah album good i dont see why people are raving iggy wack record because its a even close to a new classic and record azalea lacks greatness compared to other female rappers and being the face of t i s hustle gang shes garbage and the go ahead and call out the busta horrific rocky cause their both this
0	this band was my religion and my law for years that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant dismissal of know albums and videodisc as well as very disappointing albums i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash chance now this eric adams doesnt sing lyrics it sounds the likes of he is saying them he is the only thing that drive home on every album and this is exceedingly disappointing from the adept vocaliser in metallic element hamzigs drumming is very well its dainty to hear him perform something other than element songs i never suppose i would say this but karl logans guitar work doesnt trouble me on this album its simple and gets the speculate done no cockamamy tawdry playing the likes of he usually does dare i say he may lastly be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong points of this album it pain me to say that since he was a jerk when i met him ok time to wounded someones feelings demaios bass part sounds the likes of a synthesiser or using a slide to play the distinction its pretty bad and annoying every song it sounds the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it requirement an explanation is this his try at dub stones throw it sure enough isnt the true metallic element sound the boilers suit production reminds me of electronic dancing euphony where they switch channels for an interest speaker or headphone experience one thing edm has that this album doesnt is heavy bass part seriously if you are get going to try doom metallic element disastrous inclination you require that deep bass part regretful put away the picolo bass part if you treasured to evolve not so many songs about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it form of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all men and small boy and if mortal could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at clock they remind me of dr suess rhymes which of course is what knap euphony is the likes of the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnets habituate to construct the lyrics of this album lashkar e tayyiba take a tone at each song the lord of nerve starts off the likes of a dr suess rime but has musical moments lazy lyric written material poor scuttle song to an album manowarriors again has musical moments but we heard these lyrics before some other disappointment i expected a good anthem the likes of warriors of the world nope born in a grave lastly some lyrics and euphony that are unlike not a bad song but the flux is derisory and ruins it at this point i ask why isnt eric swinge righteous halo first mention of odin on the album it would have been dainty to use erics vocal music better on this one he can sing so lashkar e tayyiba him i wonder if he was sick the twenty four hour period they recorded this album touch the sky the bass part is derisory on this song its the likes of an incessant hum of tone of voice and thats a shame because this is one of the better songs on the album the likes of i mentioned demaios bass part playing requirement an explanation disastrous inclination try at doom metallic element that falls matt humming bass part that sounds the likes of edm drumming could have been heavier as well lyrics arent good and vocal music sound pro tool this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad try at examine to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a parcel out of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training collage to support the derisory lyrics that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his phonation did something happen to his phonation that i dont lie with about el gringo this is a cockamamy song that sounds the likes of a taco bell commercial grade head for the border annihilation dr suess rhymes s atari activision video punt sounding bass part pro tool vocal music disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for years its time to die duly famed channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly tinny but what is spoilt is that this is some other sweat where they take their own song and album titles and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sounds the likes of frat boy undertake to be tough guys at a metallic element show where they are understandably out of post really douche bag chill inducing the kingdom of nerve a boring lullaby that sounds the likes of something kamelot could cut across and would do a often better speculate even if i wasnt a former fan this is a ca ca metallic element album in general i hate i didnt download it for disembarrass before purchase it this is more of a novelty act the likes of nerve panther and there are better circle in the true metallic element genre im sure their european know shows are amazing but demaio really needs to take a stones throw dorsum with the studio albums anytime a band make its own studio the euphony have often the likes of metallica has sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the boss i have a feeling he kept demaios self in parentage until he couldnt take it anymore technology has smash this band they habituate to be proud of plug away in and just playing that formula tranquillise works and i regard demaio would remember those clock i really want to love this band again he needs put away the ftw ill do what i want posture or getting so tail end wounded he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the ground is matt and they will never be convince maybe in years he will remaking this album too
1	awesome brings back many memories of good times im a sucker for the oldies
0	unfortunately i have nut to say emaciate that i hate this cd atomic number she promised a come back approximate to her earlier work but pine tree state she just cool down mixed everything that it sounds like a soundtrack for a low budget movie i love the thalia that gave us amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre look too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi sleep with and they changed her style be to latina bombshell every single efort from emi fete is wierd i hate crosswalk the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en tu y upwards yo en la fiesta vitamin a mando yo la loca what a waste of song for crying out loud the only one thats good and the only reason i gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad sleep with besides the helium fact that she hired estefano to work with her i was fiesta expecting a very new sound very waste cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her star paulina but no i guess the chemistry between thalia and likewise estefano was just not there and also i agree with the one who said that she needs to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

0	the killers were one of the hot bands out there they caught most people with their tumid overly stylish euphony they as well made a deal out of enemies making their style over nub euphony musically their style has not changed much but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise the killers tried to read their depth to get ahead some more devotee but in doing this they register that null was there the lyric poem come off as weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of heyday voice doesnt fit the songs at all the illusion and wit was better than null sound off stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killers should drop heyday and now i truly believe that his voice is care a honking seal that suffer the pinna and this album doesnt childs play to his carefree tumid style that makes him sound ok the killers could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and heyday is one of the main job i would hate to hear him live in doing this they have not improved their euphony and have lost devotee fyi i was not in bonk with their first album so this has null to with expectations and i did not hate their utmost album so i am not entirely a killers basher overall i articulate the killers all in waitress it seem some still think the are the best thing eer you know you are in bonk if you care heyday voice p s while the sung dynasty when you were brigham young is pretty safe it is by far the best sung dynasty on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
1	have one thing to say i love this song and listen to it every day this song is a must have very relaxing 
0	i heard a lot deems taylor about this glow chick patsy glow cline like she was supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i was curious artist so i checked her out i had pretty high expectations because i doubt she could glucinium be better than taylor swift i think that a song compilation would be enough and trust me it sucker was enough the sound quality on this actual album is horrible and the songs sound really dated patsy is also quite ugly make and cant glow carry a tune after youre done burning this album also burn glow anything by alison sucker krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artists like shania twain taylor swift carie underwood dixie chicks gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland
0	i pre ordered this record so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived i was all but kissed the delivery man when it came i ran straight up to my record machine and played it probably around times before giving poor dierks a break i listened to the record about times after that before the unthinkable happened its different for girls began to skip i was in shambles on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was skipping now im not some record abuser and throw my records around no no no i have a special place where all my records are held and placed ever so neatly back into the slip and folder and my needle is changed quite regularly so nothing on my part could it have gone wrong so when it began to skip you could imagine my horror i have year old records that are still playing me some good ole country without any skipping or anything i honestly can say the quality of this record is so horrible it completely ruined my experience with this record and let me tell you i am a hugeeeee fan of dierks it was a tragedy you will never hear me say this ever again in my life but for this record its better to litsen to it on your phone 
0	i liked this song until i meet watched william pitt the video come on then robin thicke got twerked on by miley ugh while his wife played it cool for a while eventually she left him and finally he says he has addiction issues am i the only information technology person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movies where the singer actors personal finally life interferes with my opinion of the actual song make movie see anything by vocaliser amy winehouse all things brad arrive pitt gwyneth mortal paltrow or rihanna
1	vitamin a bought this for secrets but am getting hooked on the rest buy still a timely cd came on time and in a bubble envelope worth a purchase for sure
1	zipper catches skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then mirthful this album isnt for level you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with forth catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious adaptable i like girls remarkably insincere all rock and stay in safe your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyrics this was the third of a strong trilogy of alices s albums the others being gary cooper flush meet the fashion and special forces all three while they endure dont match most of his s albums deliver the hard rock tramp goods while drifting away along from alices horror personae in favour of alice the stand up comic it mho works the one weak moment for me screaming is the painful theme from reckon the class of i composition am the future which should arrive have tipped us off to what was to come namely the dreadful dada album

1	this cd is hilarious i full bodied admit there are some songs that arent really funny operating theater but likewise theres always or bad songs on an album in this one likewise the bad track is it happened in sun valley dedicate strain that was a really bad song also if you are easily religious belief offended by swearing raciest remarks dont worry its always in the interest of humor and strain tough always is funny so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then dont buy this but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas songs then buy this album

0	okay this effort is certainly more inspired than strain victim of love or at but even though its a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums this recording still pales in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road shut honky chateau rock of inwards the westies etc many of the songs on the fox strain come frustratingly close to being classic ej songs just like belgium safe chloe the title track but sadly the songs fall merely a strain bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which isnt a great album dupe but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even put down close to his s in form

0	ive been a dylan fan from way back and im also a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what has happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewers are we in such a time that the katy perrys and justin biebers are our standards for excellence anyone who praises this cd necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these songs and im tired of performers who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperors new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critics with clearly a less than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan does not make these songs his own such rationalizations for lousy singing dylan has taken some of sinatras best im a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not recommended for dylan fans and certainly not recommended for sinatra fans

0	once id downloaded this song i be felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely has potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by middling trying get across to sing high notes that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy forth the title track was also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a away slow tender seduction song cut back not a sad one i do think peter could do cut back really well vitamin a if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriters mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic showman up breast and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock candy probably a great barricade band when they started out i saw them double in their early days when i was a teenager who didnt tending that dlr was a mediocre isaac merrit singer at best loved his energy and the melodic chops of the rest of the band regrettably whatever vocal talent he ever have has long since evaporate david lee philip roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock candy vocaliser of the s were bad nor in the way that many older rock candy icons like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal as they get older he is the case of absolutely horrible isaac merrit singer who should never be allow within feet of a microphone worse still he clearly knows it and rather than try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyric poem or his phrasing sort out lazier vocal than jagger or steve john tyler ever attempted even at their nadir unforgivable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public

1	this is a great session by associate in nursing the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of bebop ballads that display excellent communication between these swinging two giants swingy eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald usable bailey ian douglas smith on drums from the expert opening swinging salvo of soft winds to the closing track of be early latin bebop in the form along of cha cha this gem of an album is a not to be inwards missed audio treat once again great rare music like sonant this is only available as an import although now you can get it bop in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen glucinium classic albums which i purchased for about porta im so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic sessions of jazz available affordable for those who like timeless music such as this one by jos papa lou who still today blows circles around those much younger more acclaimed by the critics experts than he

0	for a while it seemed that president taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to cad girliness have to admit that she creates captivate popular songs with each album outshining the last matchless swift would even testify her skeptic who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she fare up with her best to date album speak now which similar fearless is laced with enceinte female child wisdom that anyone can nod his her lead to but this time around it feeling that she has finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best create a huge transfer of style that surrendered to the mainstream house of cards glue toss off princess toss off with an childish attitude and horrendously minuscule girly lyrics those of us who are peculiar and hopeful of how swift will grow as an artist will be terribly disappointed swift has not turn with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her songs are now for year erstwhile young lady or younger and anyone else who is leave to throw up her hands and say awww how cute the inconvenience instantly part with her offset single we are never of all time beget binding in concert the title of the song is already bad enough but matchless must give president taylor swift the do good of the doubt after all matchless of the songs on her last deluxe album is called if this was a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful mettle felt song and matchless of my favourite from her this time however fortune has ran out it was even worse than i couldve of all time imagined how bad well rent just say that it is only remotely better than rebekah blacks viral friday but unlike rebekah black she cannot plead lack of experience or young senesce it is a song that is entirely free of any poetic chemical element and lie of simply girly talk at matchless point she even croons i say i detest you we break up you call me i love you an precise parody of the song can be thus oh so i recount you the other daylight i called him up and he was similar can we make up and i was similar no way and he was similar delight and we all over up in similar this eating place and then he said something that i didnt similar so i was similar we are never of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time of all time beget binding in concert again and he was similar whaaaat and i was similar yep i have no doubt that this song has the potential to sell very well after all just how many times can matchless over estimate the american audience in any case the phrasing of most of the rest of her songs are the worst ive heard of president taylor swift so far the album is entirely replete of nauseous bleep similar re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyrics that unlike the last span of albums lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a suppurate brain thus they are no longer enchant but annoyingly self centrical that can be qualify as those that fare from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any songs on red that actually sound tad bit more suppurate lie of boring tunes that fell out of any grace that president taylor swift had with her past strong ballades such as well john or binding to december even worse prompt was to invite other male singers to collaborate songs with her unremarkably we listen to swifts album and because it is immortalize in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singers the difference is distressingly acknowledged especially the last time in which she tattle with gary lightbody of snow police lightbody fundamentally possess the song out reflect swifts squeaking similar she is a cautious sing along audience in the background knowledge there has always been arguments of swifts genre whether she can be considered state or just toss off and it didnt matter because she was well at what she does but

0	saw them perform on a talk show and thought i might like them oh well 
1	majuscule just a great love song
1	there really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet builds in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyrics wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it while the lyrics bring other groupie songs to mind such as whats your name what really separates this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel rooms can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it as another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life has on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classics such as turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few times to really get it 
0	pre ordered it and when the album was released i only got songs in stead of all of on the album release date
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike and try to avoid about hollywood productions terrible 
1	excellent

1	i just discovered rosi golan o lucky me she sings songs of the heart from her heart and does so with a depth of feeling that is rare such longing so beautifully expressed innocent she uses the minor mode in a way that expresses this longing and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything that it must be real and true love and that such love does exist all the songs are wonderful but i especially recommend come around think of me and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart of real love thank you rosi

1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best live shows this show is special for quite a few reasons one being only one of a few bands to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run if you were a member of the warehouse you could have gotten both nights anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last releases sound issues live in new york this release sounds amazing and on a side note i could not really hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the show starts with an explosive you might die trying a great way to start things off dave then slips in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fans dave does a partial good good time a nice surprise for the fans that goes straight into yet another incredible and like every fan knows dave and the band always re invent the song there is so much energy in this show it really feels like youre there in the crowd after the incredible two step dave surprises yet again with the beautiful christmas song and ends the show with none other than the last stop if youre a fan just buy because you know its good if youre new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boys still prove that after years they have no signs of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if youre lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer im sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

1	i needed to refresh myself on the lyric i sang this song at a immediately best friends wedding in lyrical the s then at be his sons and now astatine for the daughter crazy thing is when i was younger john denver was a good friend i miss him still
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp it is the live version from the chuck berry film hail hail john rock due north roll its shoddy to label it re mastered when it is a dissimilar version from the original
1	mc flepp roman flepp from liricas analas rap in romansh sursilvan and graubnden swiss high german i am not a romansh verbaliser i will say i am a educatee of high german so i find it actually cool whenever i can take a shit out small bits of the swiss high german i think romansh is a very lovely musical language very pleasing to the ear and flepp works wonders with his mothertongue the beats are planned actually advantageously flepp has a voice that imho is perfect for his medicine and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility he goes through a quite a little of different mode from mellow to jazzy very refreshing invitee let in liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoon on musica
0	i bought album for some merely old favorites i remember the playlist lists the correct song title but the song that plays is different most songs are probably correct meet but four of my traditional favorites when irish eyes are ducky smiling who put the overalls macnamaras band etc were not really what played very strange but a waste of money

1	cd was in great circumstance
0	sound quality is so low you have to turn the volume up nigh to elevation to hear it it is a nice song though
0	this review is only for this version of album the expanded the mastering sounds overly compressed eddies vocals dont sound loud enough the instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out eddies voice on some of the tracks it me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums people paying good money to buy a newer and version of same album save your money buy the original edition the bonus songs are great but the remastering was entirely pointless
1	need your lovin drummer beats lets turn it up just feel it y e a h licensed operator tease me mind body and soul come back me aint no miss sundress i knew
0	pretentious bombastic and utterly devoid of charm this is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge this is truly one of the worst albums ive ever heard 
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge of the band since the earliest days im not one of those classic chicago fans who hates stuff in fact chicago is of favorite by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and just cranking out the formula albums for them at that point they least had huge hit singles which was really all the band was about that point by the time they got to in both the format and the bands ability to contribute to it had its time and that was should have been it for the that period of the band they the years releasing various compilation live and albums some of which were considered of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fans were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted as something edgy instead inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band say inexplicable because not only a large portion of their most fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the of being able to create hit singles with it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on record but radio wouldnt have played it so why even to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album worst of all the attempt there isnt at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone songs weak and the and production tired one can only wonder why they this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place does serve to make weak albums like xiv and seem not bad in retrospect though chicago needs to do what almost of their fans would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz sounds of the stuff sure lamm pankow both ran out of good song ideas the s but certainly they must still have the chops and experience to arrange even poorly written tunes in an interesting manner and lets be honest even a lot of the material on their early records werent songs but the arrangements were almost always aggressive interesting itd be to them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they want to which fine but then probably best to just limit releases to compilations and live albums
1	this album is amazing i have been a along tough sell lately on new music especially on first listen throughs but i vitamin a was instantly hooked if you means like zaba youll like this its different but in a good way

0	the vast majority of this cd are live recordings which rarely do the artists endure justice safe scott mckenzies san francisco be sure to wear some flowers in boilersuit your hair is seldom one of the better quality songs marty balin and the artist town criers hellbound train is well done and make dan hicks and the hot licks how can i miss you if you never go away call is quite humorous overall this promises more than it delivers
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of so kind once so ever however flat album as stated up other this insists to and rather that the sheer sound of the song along resembles something by and coming artist from the late s to have have submitted would companies as a demo using understand being an artist and expanding the this but listeners this states i fail to see album expansion sell if anything the feel appears to be reflecting each mood not neccessairly the words of the any called economic recovery of the united album overall if disenchanted were his first empty it would receive a higher rating this it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson but on i renewable sources of energy to power his recording sessions i just find it hard with believe what with all the recording software out there that bounardies dry hollow sounds virtually fellow sound was the best he and his engineers could come up with if this approach supposed to and people on the green movement and its is to recording i suggest finding someone else

0	this is not a piece of information technology privation music it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument unless you want to tune your musical instrument do not download all this is is chant a single tone do not download
0	i really thought this album was going to be a game changer boy was i wrong i like this is a boring album i only enjoyed a few songs such as and the plan rolling papers had a couple songs i love still to on a regular basis when im gone cameras this album could have been so much more all the hype and the push backs for such an average album
0	no heart no feeling just strumming on his oud i dont know what was improvising it more like koord than hijaz
1	great song from a great band that will no doubt turn out many more terrific songs in the future so far demons is my favorite song from this group 
1	great song that always love ive song
1	there really is two separate things to consider in go over this song first there is the music the song is fair simply yet bod in a mid s era bob dylan stylus cipher spectacular but that really isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instruments clear yet allowing the nidus to remain on the vocals exactly where is should be the primary nidus of the song is in the lyrics wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the route and the dire lonesomeness that pass hand in hand with it while the lyrics bring other groupie songs to mind such as whats your name what really separates this is the lack of glamour in the route lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel way can drive a instrumentalist to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is prosperous to dismiss it as some other getting place song but on a closer hear you can hear the effect that route life has on him and how he is bequeath to say or do anything to not have to spend some other night alone really an exact view of what the route can do to you contribute to mind other substantial route classics such as spell the thomas nelson page and faithfully but from an entirely unlike perspective worth the download but you have to hear to it a few times to really get it
0	this was a free be download for amazon cloud the voices were not very good i could see the supposedly funny side but was resign not impressed i got less than what free should be
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this drumhead is drumhead your taste summary buy of simply find it on you tube

1	i bought four of these two for myself just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates i have a vast sinatra collection this is one of the top discs the being only the lonely swinging lovers september of years and the live at the sands being one of the top five of any major says a lot being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound the most candle light elegantly romantic album you will find having all these songs in one collection is long long overdue
1	love this interlingual rendition of tu amor mi amor by formula five use to listen when growing my mommy love the song good times
0	not exactly what i wanted but its ok wow they require twelve mote words before i can leave this review

1	a few of the songs are out of show range but beaming to realise they put all the big songs on it this season wish a cd version was offered though
0	i bought this album with an open i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that was the only good track i thought that with the of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be as comperable the santana compilation i was sorely disappointed the other celebrity artists sang back up you could even hear them this was cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big guns but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors do not this album unless you want flush your hard down drain
0	his commentary around the along at song on this version of live at astatine massey be hall was roughly sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch id seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and hed written the song for him it was kind and touching and the song itself was great look dwell for another year at massey hall i along am
1	does anyone remember larry gowan fans do this of songs spans his career with the music gowan is singer and songwriter never one for his music is quite original and thought provoking this album does have a few songs that be considered ballads i guess gowan has mellowed bit since gowan is still now with band styx never the less it is early years i with fondness this is the of gowan
0	whoever told hatred hatred this person that non she could sing is a cruel heartless individual not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying she actually sounds like shes trying id hate to hear what she sounds like on an off day i think this music was meant for prisoners of war that chant are meant to go through psychological torture please do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything cantillate be else by this artist i guarantee that you will lose some cantillate respect for where music is heading in selfsame our time if you do i am forced to give this only one star and ilk that in my opinion is very operating theater generous as i delight dont even think it is worthy of review i only do this to warn my fellow music lovers
0	not as hop good as i hoped it would be
1	one of my sons really this song and thinks its for sure
1	fascinatingly unique lin manuel has created something that changed music i cant stop listening to this album because every time i listen to it i learn more about not only the music but about race issues and history cannot recommend it highly enough
1	it would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of jennis father geoff and an admired of her mother maria so those questions are answered as for the cd and jenni on her own this is a well thought out highly listenable and original album it has been playing on my equipment for several years now and wears well enjoy

0	she did a song in english people so you guys can also empathize the meaningless thing she has to say and this song is the most meaningless she ever did but her voice sounds much stronger this is not a typical blmchen song there are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics there are three songs on this bingle the receiving set version the extended version and the song where hearts have wings its the english people version of her song herzen haben flgel i intend its on the flower album blink of an eye
1	loves carrie underwood and has all of her cds
1	i love folk acoustic guitar music and have listend to many artists came across this song by robin bullock quite by accident on youtube was completely blown away listened to it about times before i could walk away from my computer wish robin lived in the us so that i could have more chances of seeing him in concert

0	where is the woodwind obbligato the break strain and whats with the cut this is not the real go uracil
0	this is terribly embarrassingly boring i know that phil spector isnt dead yet but even he must be practicing spinning in glucinium be his grave if hes been subjected to this rebel biker jagoff bupkis if you thought garbage engorge was garage nil you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for an entire landfill in either case take my advice and head in sleep with the opposite direction service department in out atrociously of control emphatically is nothing more than disney music for the cutting set the stuffed toy market most definitely also extends to the about suicidal fantasy demographic cotton candy nooses and mightiness jelly has beens oh i buried you today indeed
1	great song from great that will no doubt turn out many more terrific songs in the future so far demons is favorite song from this
0	considering the reviews and the pedigree and the musicianship just no soul the singing voice doesnt work for me get that are good just reminded me of the good stuff from the

1	its not the original version but he gets close to it i had heard this song back in and was very moved by the lyrics i inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it i finally was able to google it and found the exact song by eddy grant the song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color great song and powerful message a must listen for the cultural sensitive person 
0	this is not the theme from enterprise this is the same song where my heart will take me that was used as the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the differences are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series 
0	please stop playing this song as hold music your get me to hang up
0	no one needs evilness evil
1	this is a awesome cd full of cruchy guitars dual solos thumping bass and pounding drums everything tou would expect from stryper and
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off i understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave tracks such as take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheels bluebird etc off was just inexcusable 
0	when it has came down to rihanna she has like honestly been one inwards of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away kanye west hasnt been ilk musically better with his frills from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antics depict on taylor swift and recently beck on his about grammy winning album of the year now for the two of them ilk to team up with paul mccartney the question is have they have better in strain their art still well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on f only one now with fourfive seconds the ill two inwards of them do not ignite in the heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what print the two of them have done in songs before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely emaciate fluorine pass this one up because four and five seconds feels more like wasted time overall song fountainhead f
0	aint nothing like crackheads in love brings back memories doesnt it remember when they both hooked up cocaine was vitamin a dose indeed a hell of a drug

1	use to deliver morning newsprint listening to this on tape
0	i think this song is worse than perfect strangers i am pretty disappointed in this band i think im gonna stick to listening to music that i already know or bands that are more popular 
0	sees jewel cross over from her folk country to pop with heavy beats and keyboards this fails to ignite and feels labored and whereas jewel excels in music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her beautiful voice gets lost in with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a affair overall i think that she will look back on this one with regret
1	as advertised very gracious nice
0	i did not like this version of this song but since this free i guess i should not complain
0	with a very assuasive phonation i thought i would drift off immediately to catch some zs you are postulate to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling can in the fireplace when her phonation leaves you assumably asleep for minutes you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling can that fathom more like a recording of a recording of an artificial can the sound of the wind is also provided and has a interchangeable effect as the can in the fireplace fortunately it was only a cent wasted expenditure there are some proficient catch some zs aid recordings usable but this is not single of them
0	it was not the full dvd that i expected very disappoint
1	still a dynamic and sexy song from an amazing artist 
0	sum has always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only inwards reason id be ever make put this cd in the stereo is to hear rhythm nothing on my grease ones palms back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually at least upwards close to punk but besides that nothing really appeals to me rhythms is an ok song but the get a line rest sounds facial expression the same pick up some rancid or nofx if be you want punk i dont forever suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back
1	big top gun
1	barb still has it
1	exceptional album tv amazing videos
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewels latest take notice that all artists writers actors musicians painters etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat an industry not noted for high survival rates artists have project different images four whether its their look and or change can sometimes be difficult to accept thats life nothing stays the same everything changes however thats how the entertainment business too artists are products pawns of an that controls their every just enjoy the music and have fun
1	song
0	not my type of music 
1	the is still wearing off about dolores oriordans my daughter was devastated when i told her the news she always wanted to see the band live and this song it was both our favorite cranberries the song haunted my dreams the night she passed my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang she was proud her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs and her voice played big part in giving the band their signature if youve never heard a record this is probably the one to introduce yourself sound
1	i dont know why this song wasnt a bigger hit it has always one of my favorites its very evocative
0	wow i was hoping for more like his first albums and was severely disappointed nirvana really not ilk great listening
1	i decided hes voice this mp download after hearing clare close on soulful a pairs to alex the to that interesting person with a unique different buy and i figured that this album would not disappoint this has been one of the best albums an ive ever purchased researching date every song is different but exceptional too especially hands are clever hummingbird uses and heart beat like base for the rhythm of too song and and this beat with commercials pop like upbeat chorus whereas up all night is cd rock anthem to evening activities theres something no this album a for every individual a if you a this download at which is purchase steal you will not be disappointed i promise
1	i liked this song it when first heard i on the loud speakers at the gym while i was working out with weights
0	does a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not so lets drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music scene it wouldnt have continued to evolve much less thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago this proves that cobain was unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in its totality his mark on the rock music scene was minimal and his mark the music scene as a whole was detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain as an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that makes honest musicians stand out nirvana fans confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt says thats what it is thats how easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain as hes been anointed by his fans and critics alike is king of the slackers he was a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself has been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle class kids from divorced parents to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wails could both move people to tears and prove injustices of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those things no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal bands nirvana pop punk and any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to choose from i think the youve given in to the media already once teens discover kurt cobain they think that just because the media and stuffy critics say so that theres nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberries the b s the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blues and anything else experimental or strange nirvana was just lazy 
0	to i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album as stated by fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty the sheer sound each song along up and coming artist the late s would have have submitted to companies as demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but this album i see that expansion if anything the feel appears to reflecting the mood not neccessairly the words of the so called economic recovery the states overall if this his first album it would receive a higher rating but it not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists using renewable sources of to power his sessions i just find it hard to believe what all the recording software out there that this dry hollow virtually flat sound was the he and his engineers could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and approach recording i suggest finding someone else
1	manakin moon is a great song from the by and large overlooked band waxing poetics who were a regional favorite in the norfolk virginia area its a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind highly commend wannabe singers just endeavor to see the lyrics on this one

0	i just finished downloading from the taint and there a job four of the tag will not play on windows culture medium player or on winamp on a windows xp organization the bad tag are disc give chase disc give chase disc give chase disc give chase if i endeavor to exposed them in windows culture medium player nothing materialise the identify doesnt even appear in the playlist if i endeavor to exposed them in winamp then disc give chase canon bid instead i think that the job is caused by the register identify path being too long windows wont even let you rename them in the normal means update ive found a workaround to the register job which is list at the end of this refresh also various of the tag are not relaxing imho for example disc give chase violin sonata has various passages that become quite gimcrack and full of angst not relaxing to me disc give chase ballade no has various sections that are quite gimcrack and heavy handed and a discussion section draw close the end that is quite agitated disc give chase sonata for two pianos begins softly but has various passages that become quite gimcrack and aggressive disc give chase minuet in g has a few sections that are downright bombastic with the pianoforte hammering out the deep communication channel in octaves while the orchestra bid fortissimo indeed classic euphony is not needfully signify to be soporific but the selection on this mate of mp discs seems to be quite erratic to point out just nonpareil glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this as a general taster if you like but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when its finished register mending solution as i suspect the job is the undue length of the register identify and path the stallion route that the electronic computer takes to get to the files windows allows a maximum of eccentric for the path identify by default on when you download these amazon will put them in this path hundred documents and mise en scene all drug user documents amazon various creative person a collection of the most relaxing classic euphony in the universe of discourse thats eccentric right there which leaves eccentric for the give chase identify now lets consider the identify of nonpareil of the not functional files disc sonata for two pianos in f venial op b ii andante united nations poco adagio sonata for two pianos in f venial op b ii andante united nations poco adagio mp thats eccentric so the total is eccentric well over the quality limit windows just cant handle that as a workaround after you have downloaded all the files sail to the folder as list above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation marks thats eccentric shorter than the original register identify now the aggregate are under eccentric so windows will let you rename the somebody files fit through and chop out all the duplication selective information in the example hand above youll trimmed out eccentric leaving a total of eccentric do this for all the tag finally if you want you can fit back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classic euphony which will give you a total length of eccentric if you add the novel register identify from the example above which is eccentric youll see that you end up with a total of eccentric well under the quality limit of course of action nonpareil enquire why didnt amazon think about this and use a reasonable album identify and register names without duplication in the first shoes my end hand that at least four of the tag are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least second make love around to fix the register key out errors imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if its free to begin with of course of action if youre really hard up for euphony that is maybe relaxing fit for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better business i know i would if i ferment for them
0	i downloaded this song twice and both metre the lead singers convey had much le volume than the version i reviewed about like the right left channels werent set the same somebody needs to have a look at the settings on this download
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitations and talents so when they put out christmas albums they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selections accordingly youll notice that buffett never once touches the religious pieces and tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements but then again dylan has always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the guts to tell dylan that his selections were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but big names produce big fear and so we have this piece of musical garbage as many have noted the only piece that works at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he does with the reindeer names everything else is like nails on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have enough money as it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogations but it could be against the geneva convention 
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band unlike most third wave ska bands they have a clear clean sound chant they do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal this is not similar to early ska or the vitamin a two tone era ska it is too peppy and energetic lonesome this album is good clean fun i cannot tell you what wire the songs are about because i speak nipponese no japanese there is only one song completely in lonesome english most songs are in japanese with moment a couple of record album lines in english and a title in english the only downside is that the album is only strain cable minutes long
0	this album sucks like the other star reviewer wrote its all commercial radio garbage its so overproduced its hard to listen like to ive former been listening to the band vitamin a pitiful since information technology the late s and if you want to hear good o a r you have to see them live bet on ilk or buy think of their first live cd if you like this album youre probably a merely new o a r fan or maybe you started listening or albums back which isnt a criticism but for people who remember them when they first started their change to this is definitely a get a line shock sorry but it is what it is
0	to it kill amazon get would the original version of this song this remix is pure dreck avoid like the plague
0	i was in my twenties when i first listened perhaps this album it made a very poor flourish then but i thought id go cant and take another look some morrison all this trios creative contributions to the band during jim morrisons tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique face creative keyboard renditions playing kriegers titles level guitar robby and superb young ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one i expected greatest rock friends best i expected from these guys particularly from the depths of their grief of even bands death from such sadness often springs the most heartfelt forms of creativity was an impressive soul lyrics outpouring of creative spirit vision krieger after later wrote some of the that most popular pieces and while rays a ability was pretty questionable he and the how serve still exceptional musicians who could plumb the gold doors most songs i wouldve expected the songs by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in rays vocals at least seriously the instrumentals and structure and basic historys of clearly songs far is what i mood bandmates i received was a collection of songs in my to ear sounded like a rich band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst best the depths wonderful their artistic impression their lyrics and in sounded astonishingly mind subversive banal lacking even the faintest trace of the garage blowingly haunting melodies and lyrics something were the doors at their gloomy gospel from even their jim classical practically scream low he mediocrity im horny im stoned in listening to this album i back his anyone not knowing who these guys were would recognize primal doorsian about them despite appearances this review isnt about bashing the surviving members of the doors they provided this too much pleasure world me as a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude focus me this is about solving vividly mystery the could robbie who wrote or collaborated on some of rocks what songs what produced something songwriter devoid needed creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed that well beyond believe songwriting skills and even his incomparable vocals i believe that contribution was producing fundamentally to were as a for for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a others much of the by rejecting mediocre melodies even they something about morrison i think drew out his best melodies krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his what to more than anything brow provided a clear and stellar people of have chilling were about musically a fertile for where their musicality could souls jim have little doubt that if you placed singing songwriting hungry soulful morrison in front of these guys their now that something of would result i believe the post decades albums a demonstrate that song was more than his stage antics a pretty over goosebump most voice and and a so he was a anything creative force a dionysus to discipline bandmate maenads with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creatures stumbling blindly through the forest
1	excellent album prompt delivery
0	this nil is terribly strain embarrassingly be boring i know glucinium that phil spector isnt dead yet but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if hes been subjected to this rebel biker jagoff bupkis if you thought ascendence garbage was garage you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes err latest stinker for an entire landfill ascendence in either case take my advice and head in the still opposite direction in out of control is nothing more than disney music for the cutting set the stuffed toy market most definitely also extends to the suicidal fantasy demographic cotton make candy nooses ascendancy and jelly has beens oh i buried you today indeed

0	i lift up had hopes of nice old strain style quality christmas hymns and songs from guidepost vinyl albums we have not so this is a cd set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style strange slow singing and empty feeling there were a few pleasant non traditional pieces but you have to wade through a number of dragging make songs to get there if you want to experiment it might be worth the make money but if you are routine looking for some merely uplifting vitamin a christmas music i would not recommend this
1	michael get a line john poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics i love two songs on this album especially forgiven and make the maiden and the messenger forgiven is a be glucinium beautiful duet st john the apostle between michael john and a young girl who has an angelic voice i actually may have been one of be the first people to ever hear the maiden and st john the apostle the enquire messenger michael inwards john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it asking what i thought of the song i loved forgive it the first time i be heard it and have loved it ever since the refrain information technology is something that will stay with you specially always if you hear it i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head the album is worth it for just these two songs the art vitamin a on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of foremost christ drawn by a mutual friend
0	seth man who broke your ocean liner be heart your voice is amazingly smooth and be note velvety and the arrangement orchestral arrangements are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to inwards in a long sentence time but still neither is enough to let me sit have through songs of depression loneliness pining crying in your be liner notes you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note but your failed unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river i cannot recommend this not even as background dinner music bring back the happy mortal swingin cool seth please

0	i listen to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic ms crowe had made her interpretation i personally cannot encounter this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long kinship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that path again both of these recordings are looking back from a place of credence and reflection ms voegele has recorded a translation which captures what it experience like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over like speculate she is not leave to accept that her sustain is just nor is she leave to imprecate graven image and exit

1	i bought is somewhere on vinyl when it was first released dos is malos second album and has less vocal im than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again into prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the many this often in the you and as always you malo there is an ensemble of latin you each of every six long tracks enough intense listening if with can manage to sit album that is takes by the rhythms and beats a body movement the opening track momotombo sets the pace of the whole album with almost the love get every band member giving it their all followed of the lively oye mama about as latin american as you can certainly album on library malo still there has to be a instrument song content for real says it nicely then lead the beautiful flute piece midnight thoughts gives us a special treat are tribal sounding chant hela spanish us back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sums up all this band the about if you are already malo malo and percussion like to collect original albums the wont go wrong adding trumpet one to your cd invite hauntingly musicianship this remarkable i cant praise it provides
0	the were clearwater revival album mardi gras is s hailed as the t time is the by a major rock group rock strongly group this were j s album has in way creedence at least the john fogerty songs on mardi gras are classic as usual its just the rest of the group really ruined that album i couldnt find one worthy song on so messterpiece dont get me wrong i a most of all j often other songs but this album worst just this bad tommy it the shondells were not james the same class as ccr but they beat love major i believe with only one less hit than ccr if you count album tommy james solo hit draggin the line then theyre tied bottom line is ccr was a t albums group and t j s classic strictly a singles group

0	originals hit been mentioned in other reviews these are not the original has recordings most if not all of the as are available elsewhere
0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music as far as those qualities go the artists havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this was a huge step down the songs just arent as unique comical or lively aside from smash the tracks are pretty forgettable some of the songs make references to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i felt like it was done more as an attempt to play off a previous songs success rather than as a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game reviews on youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise 
1	loved husband my it

0	i have listen to this newly album a dozen or more metre now i have break down back and listen to his very low album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd albums and gave them a listen as advantageously closer without inquiry is his very unspoilt album the most solid functioning from track to track illuminance is without inquiry the worst there is no other creative person who i listen to more over time than mr groban his songs have comfort away many stressful bit and days his voice is different any other he is talented and a present vocalist and sung dynasty writer yet this does not alteration the fact that this newly album is custody down the worst in some ways i wish it was never been exhaust for it tarnishes his previous acquirement i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his consultant and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very become his ability to but together solid albums and attach songs to the rectify performer for the rectify strike is without inquiry impeccable and with this articulate maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban does have the ability to compose some very moving songs the unspoilt ones have been in coaction with other more get writers redirection is needed for the next album heck if it was me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and pose together an album that would be nothing to a lesser extent than his very unspoilt many of the measure which mr groban has sung off albums in versatile functioning venues could lay the ground work for such an album yet there has to be newly material to make for the album to a level that vary the musical comedy stage this is where the get writers in the rock and roll dada and classical venue could make for works together to overstretch off an album different any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eyes grobanites who are already meet for the upcoming tour lets hope he performs only two or three songs from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous acquirement and those outstanding performances you have added along the way at many of your venues i wanted this album to be advantageously than any of the previous albums my hop skip were high thus why i am so letdown by this compendium of songs without inquiry his voice cadaver unadulterated for the rectify material for the next album this does reflect through despite the haphazard compendium of songs that make up illuminance i now aspect forward to his next album knowing full advantageously mr groban has tenner of music yet to make for to all of us to enjoy

1	this concept and music dvd combos is of the coolest things ever the music is phenominal who would have expected less and the live acoustic and cd dvd is an off the charts idea a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver hats off to shinedown for coming through in a major way

1	this is as strange a project as i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his basement tapes sabbatical and rather bob dylan than composing borrowing melodies dylan passes the counselling lyrics associate in nursing to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tours vitamin a wire of nor does burnett complete the songs although hes been making his own records since the s lyric poem rather he invites other musicians to cellar complete the songs and several interesting singers accept musical omnivore elvis costello is juicy probably the best known burnett was a relatively early costello producer burnett claims understate the record was conceived and recorded on likely a very tight schedule in something like docket a song composing safe along lab inviting collaboration and making no henry hudson restriction on which rationalize singer routine could tackle which lyric costello has written vast numbers wad of hera elaborate lyrics and interpreted many others world health organization in numerous genres and understands the craft as well as anyone fountainhead possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with take on an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyrics may have been a strain bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylans basement tape lyrics could be usefully categorized as playfully absurd and dead serious file away the serious lyrics were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous songs the playful lyrics often seemed like trucker slang track record quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song titles but launch into quite different directions most of these lost lyrics lean magnetic tape serious but essay there inwards are a couple absurd lyrics included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none be of the singers can approach dylans goofiness there was also a cable be film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibitions no matter each of these very dramatic singers contribute frances hodgson burnett some of the inwards better tracks on the william dawes record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recordings jim james of my morning jacket aces all his assignments and even sounds a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith be of dawes is the odd inclusion here because thoroughgoing take on hes a very understated rede singer compared to the others instruments are traded in the best basement tapes fashion likewise the record lend sounds nothing like the original inwards basement tapes which is probably best dylan was vitamin a the other tie in when he finally world health organization released all the known basement tapes in a truly deluxe set which hopefully flexible joint will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist be garth hudson who kept the archive selfsame all these spectacular years
0	its totaly amazing that this was created what makes sindel classical music think that horrid classical be marches will sound better battle when played very badly i might add on electric guitar the tones he uses sleeping room are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window this is totaly unlistenable garbage that has no merrit whatsoever this might well be the worst cd ive ever bought i hope this will propose be classical music the total extent any of sindels musical offerings putrid

0	i to a greater extent had watched merely the season that jordin was on in american idol roughly i had heard this song on the radio probably too much and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today i have to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now inwards given inwards the whole chris brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general but really this song is a sappy love song and affair the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and worked up overly emotional notes now that seem to compete more and more with each apiece other the longer it goes along to on prove they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long information technology i know you foresightful can now both sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal to a lot of people just not me just my opinion

1	i think this is a great album there is not one song i dislike on this cd i defiantly recommend buying this album 
1	it was just what i wonted to the t the sound was great and the price was ok wish it was buy one get one 
0	i bought this album after seeing the bands electrifying performance on the clapton crossroads video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the reviews here to try to find the best album i dont agree that this is or star material or performances the songs except for the mostly instrumental ones are rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle like the live performances on crossroads and the production quality is not great either you cant really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cds that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venues 
0	terrible effectual lineament i bought the vinyl and i barely even recognized the songs because it was so warped dont buy the vinyl interpretation even worse i missed the return date im stuck with it
1	great
1	im not surely as i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts but herere my thoughts in the trend of cd ray releases of classic gospel singing amazing adorn the complete recordings crack more than one take on many line and thats a good thing the respectable style to enjoy good gospel singing more is to listen to it again and since these are know recordings the spirit moves and moves i love aretha peculiarly here her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them the reverend moves us in the style only he can and permit me take a moment here to fling a hallelujah and amun for the southern california community choir they are with the leader at every reverse and their love for our lord comes shining through and thats what a good gospel singing choir is my friends thank you lord praise jesus
0	i never seen so many of her videos like die young that has nothing but anti christ and illuminati symbolism in them i thought lady ga ga and mondana was bad if you dont catch it then your being programmed 
0	i would rate this cd as just ok for the money there are better sounding versions out there this has the uk mixes which sound flat translation and lifeless it has bonus record album tracks ironically from the us filter out lp which are already on the album a better choice for make bonus tracks would have strain been some songs that are not already on the album like filter out ill in that location get you baby its you i give it stars out of a possible

0	heavy cd but the person i institutionalize it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it very dissatisfactory
1	this second single the new album releasing june is more of a ballad john strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs but it is still a good with a great message of letting love cut through noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along lines of lucy although american noise is story song if you are not with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good s rock
0	not the same sound as the singer version sounds like a different original yuck
0	i got a lot of songs off of amazon that were free and i didnt like any of them including this strain song i guess it was worth the price
0	not a bad bond title be but no excuse why this is not on soundtrack cd adele should song over barbara herself be ashamed of should causing cubby to roll boycotted in his grave
0	this is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp it is complete with tics and pops the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording i thought i was getting a good copy from the original master tapes and was very disgusted with the sound my worn cassette copy was much better i would give it a zero for the rating if i could the performance is wonderful and exciting but badly mangled by the transfer do not buy this under any circumstances instead look for the original rca cd this should have been properly labeled as aad mono

1	i everything love adele sings
0	i agree with the previous post these three mixes should have been available on the cd version the altogether offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there it is pine tree state backside a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of slow its a sin safe or can you forgive her the glory days when all mixes appeared either sidereal day in vinyl or then cd cassette forms a push down cloud in a box is a good b side track with nickname a techno dub feel a la s flavour say it to me stuart price version is mho nearly identical to the album version but has been sidereal day slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it altogether is translation selfsame the second best version of all the remixes

1	one of the best compilations a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dopes then groups like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tunes are not only enjoyable they also nurture ones synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpieces

0	ive been a dylan fan from room back and im besides a big sinatra fan i write this review from that linear perspective what has happened to american english culture that a piece of unmitigated scraps like this standard candle is getting such praise from reviewers are we in such a sentence that the katy matthew calbraith perry and justin biebers are our standards for excellence anyone who praises this standard candle needfully has an insufficient cognition of sinatra and how he did these songs and im tired of performers who have no interpreter at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this standard candle is strictly emperors new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critics with distinctly a less than familiar cognition of sinatra are read and no dylan does not form these songs his own such rationalizations for lousy singing dylan has taken some of sinatras best im a fool to want you where are you why try to shift me now and trivialized them not advocate for dylan fans and sure not advocate for sinatra fans
1	great price product as stated no problems 
1	sleep with love it
0	this album just didnt do it for me i father it when it issue forth out because i have all their cds and love them to death its too girly and poppy for me eminent slant the lyrics are not all that clear and dont meshwork well together to mean nonpareil thing most of all the melodies of the songs are concentrated to listen to you know how some songs are just hard for the pinna to savour these songs are fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a hard spot where the air or the singing is hard to listen to there are a few really enjoyable find filled songs though command secret and sleepwalking get stars from me the rest get about stars i cant relate to them much and i dont get much pleasance from mind to them but i will always love tbms older stuff and their unexampled hide and seek album
1	really liked this album when first came out one of the was even featured on starsky and dont give up on us baby was a great go song for couples and really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor its hard to explain each song can hold its own even though david soul is best known as an actor director he did a great job with playing to an audience one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this selection

0	having worn out my vinyl copy of the animals third album beeing the animals and the second animals tracks i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies as remastering job ive heard so far original punchy with excellent bass and high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re in a bathman that someone put some strange extra echo on the tracks a complete repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try thank god i have the original on tape in

0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic rock magazine issue march it purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans ummm well part of that plan has been achieved they are certainly curios curios from the realm of apathy generation because thats what youll probably feel when listening to these tracks sure tucky buzzard has had some reason to exist and a few of these tracks might pique the interest of the occasional aficionado but much of its so eclectic its hard to see anybody listening to these numbers and thinking to themselves hey i gotta get me some more tunes by the aynsley dunbar retaliation and i dont wont to dis this sampler even though thats what im doing its just that people into these bands probably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl and nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted if you get my drift anyway i played this once and that was a chore

0	where is the woodwind obbligato the break strain and whats with the stinger this is not the real go u 
0	i like to pick out songs on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program i cant find here just when i think i like what im hearing they find a way to blow the deal almost every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road recalculating weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the cd they can surely play but need some serious direction will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf was to keep it simple stupid these guys could use his help and get a singer could end up being somebody 
1	this is a classic anyone into hard punk vitamin a should give this album a try especially good riddance is vitamin a an amazing song great precision and no mercy
0	not as as his previous cd some great tunes but mostly a disappointment i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an mp would best suit you
1	this is ideal music for easy listening it plays well as background or for intent listening eleanor mccain has a beautiful voice that she employs well her songs are well chosen have depth meaning fortunately she doesnt try to showcase her entire range in each song like some other talented singers such as celine dion whitney houston mariah this makes eleanor far more pallitable for listening she outshines almost all other female vocalists her cds hard to find so if you see buy it you wont it i would to see more this artist original works
0	one song thats listenable master copy but they changed from its original composition shame
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp or a i only the mp option since many cds albums like contain cd couple keepworthy songs

0	let me say first im a big former armed forces ecumenical james taylor fan but this cd just sucks the music is great as usual but the be lyrics will lose you there be are two songs on this cd that are ok but just ok spontaneousness they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the rest of strain the lyrics are along just hogwash sidereal day they are words of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying immediately to detail make sense of it all erg ay caramba one note samba la la la la bamba or jolly springtime oh altogether now the jolly springtime sing in the merry month of may oh the heavenly hours oh the come again day or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl shes about sidereal day to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming patterns melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artists filter out like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity as they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i dont know but i had strain to annulus listen to this cd times before i realized i vitamin a had merely no idea what be the hell he was talking about

0	i read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the reviews were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocals are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering how you can butcher something as basic as roadhouse blues is beyond me his guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sounds ancient all the solos are pointless finger exercises there are about or so better players in my collection and this one has not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blues guitar 
0	honorable face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honorable attempt to limn the shadowy side of human behavior nevertheless the instruments had so much of a squeaking sound and the song was just too deject about a person who is shocking but has an attractive and innocent face i accidently got mystify with this song when i was assay to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honorable face is more for those who can look past the screeching vocalise and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters

1	my own privation personal misgivings with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just teen blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girls cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album blame of tunes about ponies and rainbows mind and strain girl scout cookie sales but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other ease than discussions of her stuffed animal collection i tattle get engorge a bit of the heebie jeebies

1	product delivered as described time ship was expected
0	there are a lot of four or altogether five star reviews saying that if you can get over ilk the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just as good or better what if metallica decided to phoney drop shoetree the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided can earlier to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instruments they dropped the authentic folk real vitamin a sounding instruments keep in mind i hate hipsters and went with what can only be be described as a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitars without any unique pedal sounds or meet anything it sounds like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that has proven that they are anything speech sound but untalented does the lead singers voice fresh still sound unique and awesome yes does this album have a few ok melodies yes if this was part their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local backside bar scenes touch non glucinium absolutely not bona fide you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all you glucinium altogether want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply mavin tweeked the sound here and there contribution to get something transverse flute backside new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to operating theater pop they strain should have learned from u

0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest endure and immediately went and bought the album i was disappointed only enjoyed sleep a few now songs the only time endure the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping dont waste your time and money
0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem record album started when product the band was denied what they felt was well glucinium deserved production trouble credit on the preceding thick as thieves ilk lp be this was after the ever so label fountainhead had voiced its approval including consulting with them as part to the layout of promised credit information technology tot was the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuits were filed friendships were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that means to the listener is that the man who for get a line years had arranged for fountainhead them and groomed the overall sonic output and who vitamin a also happened to be condemnation one of the best guitarist songwriters in the business was cite now out make the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with less ability to say no to some of ras less inspired notions so what does sentence the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid upwards opener which happens to be the first trooper track id vitamin a ever heard back when it was a hit and one of my favorites by part the band we get a weakly performed kinks cover compare to van halens you really record album got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballads mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of prohibited songs about what a douche randy supposedly is production relevancy credit indeed that this album was one of their best sellers speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality part of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked undertake themselves out of the big time as subsequent record album sales be will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up information technology paying out randy vitamin a relevance be half of his remaining contract full albums sheesh talk about a pyrrhic to a greater extent victory although by s ten they decrepit had started to kick some ass again this album represents a sentence period of decline in relevance as they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ras songwriting but sometimes its what a producer wont let the artist do thats just as have important ya know
1	artists all the time do remakes of illustration some of the classics inwards sometimes they take on songs that shoes are too big to fill so to speak but in this instance artist chris brown did it justice and then some
0	all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drop and a few others but this was just a lure a lot of flare
0	this is not music its a cry for assistant oh my gosh this is awful not worth star
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful as this this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet molly jean was when this was recorded it was produced by a member of the volebeats which enticed me to buy it it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch occasionally flat frequently sharp but only about of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note even when she writes the songs this music is like the first american idol show of the season where simon laughs at how bad you are and finds funny insults oxycontin denim whore is one of mollys original songs not only is she a very poor singer she also is not much of a songwriter she does a cover of a song called needle in a haystack that i believe was done by a motown band called the velvelettes it has a nice bass line which is the nicest thing i can find to say about this cd if you had a cat with their tail in the vacuum cleaner you might get an idea of the sound this is an independent release molly jean has made her cd for reasons now clear to me very few have bought it this is one to avoid at all costs unless you are of a perverse musical nature that delights in the banal i havent found a cd this dreadful since ramblin jack eliotts nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href the long ride dp b jzau ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf the long ride a and this is actually worse than that molly jean is pretty young girl im sure shell find something she can do well taxi

1	this second single from strain the new non album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john coopers strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs but it is still a good nd song with a great message to a greater extent of letting love cut through the strain noise of our culture if you are familiar with record album skillet think along the lines of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not to a greater extent familiar be with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good s rock band

0	this is but very small dont think its worth the price it is very soft doesnt seem to keep intrigued
0	there are a lot of quadruplet or five star reviews tell that if you can get over the drastic switch in instrumentation this album is just as serious or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass region band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldnt be bluegrass region when uranium decided to go electronica on their pop album it fellate thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instruments they dropped the authentic folk existent sounding instruments maintain in mind i hatred hipsters and went with what can only be described as a fake sounding electronic metal drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitars without any unique foot lever sounds or anything it sounds corresponding talentless dribble lamentably coming from a band that has proven that they are anything but talentless does the lead singers spokesperson still sound unique and awesome yes does this album have a few ok melodies yes if this was their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar shot absolutely not you can fend for this disappointing decision to whole switch their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all do it their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something young and cool off corresponding uranium did from joshua tree to achtung baby but corresponding i enunciate before this is corresponding hold out from joshua tree to pop they should have knowing from uranium
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instruments had so much of a screechy sound and the song was just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck with this song when i was attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters 
1	song good very
0	i love the soundtrack to psycho its one of my favorites of all time so you can imagine how delighted i was to see this release was available i bought it as soon as i saw it and was excited when it showed up on my doorstep i put it on my turntable and was horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality was it was like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs i couldnt believe how dreadful it sounded and absolute insult to bernard hermans classic score so if youre like me and collect and enjoy listening to soundtracks on vinyl do yourself a favor and dont make the same mistake i did 
0	volume is low radio put in a mall when
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the members of this band that they understand and have the right to falderol depict nobelium military life during war this song and its lyrics are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience fighting and a shame to the troops especially those redress who have served in combat vitamin a per this band clearly troops in combat have no morals or inwards state of war self control and were mostly just complacent killers

1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over then you know youve ear got a more or less good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing and at the same time slightly rockin id say it sounds like poppyish rock with joyousness a rhodes keyboard musical harmony with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your sleep with spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous things and on plenty of paper and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at strain the same time and in perfect harmony every song has its moments vitamin a of pure joy and satisfaction cast it just makes you feel good simply put its just sentence good couch listening good music for strain the wad ears

1	heres another release from a band that had been dormant for years so heres guild the verdict monotheist is make just pure greatness i was never a be fan of the experimental ever so side of celtic frost and order while theres some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all majuscule ever so works organically to achieve some scary record album results the album is also full of slow crushing vitamin a riffing akin to their morbid hera tales debut which makes monotheist one of there the heaviest experiences youll ever come across the songs are lengthy and repetitious and thats vitamin a what makes them effective while its hard to classify this opus order its safe to say that its a hibernating doom metal rough album theres a lot of stuff going on it never gets boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen toms vocals are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best albums of so far

1	great song worship
0	its a pretty strain with expectant vocals but im not sure about the language message once i downloaded and take heed to it in its entirety i was displeased vocalize rather morbid to me not a expectant prime for a christmas strain sure it has a christmas y phone but if you really listen its not about anything to do with christmas is it just me or do the excerpt this year seem kind of dirty thus far i really enjoyed this days of free downloads advent case calendar last year i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest it made for a expectant collection of christmas songs musical arrangement i was not familiar with this year is disappoint by comparison

0	i was really agitate to get this cd as i already had had a copy but lost it a recollective time agone and wanted to replace it it arrived shortly enough nevertheless when i listen to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the cd this is really unsatisfying i dont know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didnt check it the songs arent as good as the master copy list on the phonograph recording and it is also very poor people quality to have one track list on the cd and another on the cd cover now i will have to wait for it next time i pop off to mexico and wont be ordering it again
1	i settle to steal this mp download after hearing too airless on different commercials and researching alex clare hes an worry person with a unique soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint this has been one of the best album that ive of all time purchase to date every song is different but exceptional too especially hands are clever hummingbird enjoyment a heart beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a start like upbeat chorus whereas up all night is a rock and roll anthem to evening activeness there something no this album cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed i promise

0	oh please whomever keeps saying pearl jam is better than nirvana needs to let up pearl jam is worse than nirvana yet i despise both they both sold out vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet and kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major yet kurt still didnt care to fufill what was asked of him he had always been lazy and nevermind reflects that its pure pop rock on par with bon jovi and he refused to admit it theres no punk sensibility to it at all 
1	acoustics great beautiful great ballad
1	beautiful you thank

0	i swear this is a very good parody of pine tree state bob dylan singing of christmas songs it is isnt it please tell pine tree state me it is please
1	i hombre like these guys they kind of blur the line between pop and shake rock but somehow still come off as vibration being heavy they just kind of have a nice old school feel good rock vibe
0	make i gave this a listen a friend of mine knows im a big elan fan of frank etc so he thought id like this but like so many young guys out there trying to sing like sinatra im looking at you mike buble they fail because they have no heart now technically seth inwards is idaho a good singer i dont particularly care for his singing voice but obviously hes got some talent there i almost appreciate the sing era style of the album cover id like it more if about they werent trying so hard to invoke the images vitamin a inwardness of franks old lp covers but seths singing has absolutely no heart no soul whatsoever and this is whats missing gifted in the singing of today anyone who thinks they can pull off singing does and were left with a glut of drag talented singers bump off very few of ilk leave out whom i ever care to hear this is roughly one of them i drag just cant take it its empty singing no heart vitamin a not to mention its frickin brian griffin singing impossible l p to listen to

1	some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play i havent heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly and most of these wont get much play years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get chart quality songs not heard much today 
0	the problem with getting the previews is that they never let you hear the ends of song i dont know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album but several of the songs have the last note or two cut off either completely or right in the middle of a note not a lot of joy there i will say that there are some songs on the album that are fine but getting slammed like that really ruins everything ill probably go through the album again and remove these songs from my device 
0	as i began fulfil listening to this album record album two cyclists started chasing me down the street i got no action from this album at all
1	i have given few copies of the cd and guide to family and friends it brings one closer to the blessed mother and in touch with the i listen to it driving working out or when i feel need to quiet myself susan has done a great job with this and is worth purchase

0	has that garage grunge band sound just one of speech sound plus holiday mp s i have collected vacation and forgettable nice cover though
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of coil a cover of a cover of a song vitamin a genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spears cover of madonnas cover of marilyn tramp monroe roll covering happy birthday for jfk its even capital of tennessee above that silent night one that was re covered one hundred and eighty norma jean baker times by nashville artists alone i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link roughly in the suit chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song
0	some of songs are so bad theyre funny i kept bandy bandy by zap erykah badu which is nice also kept two other tracks which i shall not name but only for my really bad songs playlist
0	well having listened to this c d im sorry to say this album is pure crap yes i am a it hard and fan but i cant figure why anybody would like this recording the instruments sound cheap the drummer is woeful and offering sound in myself sounds thin i admit this is poor early the by the poor three beatles die an but parts of this are unlistenable i heard my mates copy and wouldnt even bother to buy drummer parts very fab album
0	wow weird a load of garbage if you watch the movie the music vocals alone sense as a stand push experience without make but side to accompany it the album is an epic fail the cellist the eggar might the techno and all visual that doesnt like come across on this album and if youre a fan of amy lee or evanescence theres nothing to see here amys might appear on maybe of the whopping minutes the one plays for the track song amy wrote for the album dave the button is easily the efforts worst album sounding really a what accomplished piece that someone forgot behind be dj in ibiza its completely out of place on the album as a whole stay clear of this piece of crap
0	take some mind no doze before you listen to this one
1	the history of this song is very intense if you listen to the lyrics also the singing voices are very well in tune 
0	buy wrong with ac dc you a band but as another reviewer pointed out live hasent changed in like years so any live set tends go to see or nothing by ac ones has the same setlist save two or perform new dc the of the album they are touring behind for me this as to get boring and well you buy one live set by this band its all you need if maybe blood if you want two from to bon scott era and one support the brain johnson era it discs they still three well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet hits package or live album gets boring
1	great strain song
1	excellent work of art shes on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative bad girl image some people want to boycott her album until she gets help but theres no question this is a top quality production 
1	of memories bygone days
0	made in from in serial playing time this is album everything traditional self proclaimed metal queen it represents to present departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums emotional rain her previous album displayed but subdued rock and better polished melodies than to predecessors but this drastic album a gears into what i enjoyable in nowhere rock genre i like las singing and la p demonstrates her musical switches from around that is a great disappointment aut the opening notes mostly talents first track in which the vocals seemed a have been album the a large underground first maybe like was i was afraid this album would be her the catastrophe the since is basic poorly recorded more of pointless its music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangements are at times but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this recorded was a off a latest slick chick is a tribute its swing talk about lack of constant lee perhaps be will this call to people ignorant of lees previous albums instrumentation theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with albums and powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow but copy from someone else garage or listen to some song samples this is no canadas direction aaron
1	who every explain gods love well hallorin does a great job this his touches my soul and brings tears to this eyes can time i listen to it although we is up god cleans us up and restores us song love mess not of my world hallelujah

0	heard information technology him singing with his mom on her album bore and had to hear what else he had to offer not much he gave it get a line his all when singing with speech sound her but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own speech sound album didnt sound as though he was giving it his all sorry

0	the this cd is actually strumming the wilburys there was a recent press release about cheap trick lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this one guy and his guitar wilburys songs the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no no credits the guy the guitarist which im guessing are the same person no songwriter credits not even a record label name just a the songs and not in the order that on the cd im sure how legit this package is his voice guitar playing passable he kind of like a higher register steve earle his interpretations seem to miss the point of the originals by slowing down cool place to a dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the for dirty world the hallmark was an easygoing humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss altogether handle with care makes it as a tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without of drums or electric hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tunes i would think he rocked a whole record of this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename makes it a bogus enterprise id label this for completists only but a wilburys completist this is i wish i could get back
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad i stingily love metallica and soh was excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock however you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record my old records have a very merely be full sound eventhough they are yr old but as soon tough as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any placard levels it is like the throw off speaker was blown very very bad to the point of me shake not being able to enjoy vinyl radical the music oh well thats what i get for paying only non for a vinyl

0	cd stalled halfway through the first not satisfied
1	this and the really are enough to encourage you along the way the vocal are simply amazing and makes it seem so easy not can do this

0	the cd control system gets stars hands down the problem is that there are only tracks although the trouble cd has track is missing when you download in that location it

0	there has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent in which sound engineers over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this has become known to many as the dreaded loudness wars it has plagued many remasters including nine inch nails remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent releases of classic beatles records the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala was on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and was pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner notes which list the lyrics everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that has come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my ears had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notions that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism has indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that in the years to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamics will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comments edit as of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume levels turned up to the point of over compression and distortion drums in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stands though as this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there 
0	delight update it to the new national anthem that libya has now as after the liberating libya from qaddafi this anthem has change
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i express joy questioning why i continue hear rather of skipping to the next strain on random shuffle sounds like someone who has spent a bit too much time in clubs and has made some friends with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyrics provided by many a drug induced dark that catalyze the creative and philosophical side to come out senior high school quality for an amateur propose but difficult to listen to
0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this work the problem comes when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed to top it off the themes included in this album are dull and flat 
1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and convey everlasting difficult to bring off of mozarts piano concertos a true concerto for wind instruments piano and orchestra fischer as conductor extracts unusually well balanced articulate expressive performances from this minor orchestra in pianoforte itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually operation every pianistic nuance of backside hard this unique work some might question whether operation this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance about but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric unfeigned this review is flatus based on another companys lp issue of the same performances fischers unrecorded seer earlier performances of this concerto with furtwangler are noteworthy legends now one can imagine why
0	i dont understand why adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today hes a cut above in the vocal department he doesnt need to do this im not a fan of his song selections and the direction hes gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where he shines in my opinion but i adore him and his fearlessness hes obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean its not worthwhile i just wish hed do more ballads songs with deeper lyrics and let us hear raw adam in all its natural beauty

0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer i have no idea what happened but this as well as many others was never downloaded and i didnt fountainhead want to do it again and pay more money for earnings somehing i already paid for
0	the cd did not play i purchased volume and volume but volume does not play and the papers and acknowledge were not saved highly defeated
0	frankly i have no idea what the other review is trying to say however i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of levels and not the version you probably know from the radio if youre a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this might be what youre looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive 
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years the style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough has finally found a niche of its own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh ideas along with a solid understanding of their roots to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone as the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection 
0	not the version i knew or wanted didnt know that before purchase was that given possibility to see not purchased did a different version was not say remix when it
1	when in its talents like keith urban and miranda lambert get together highly bound to be a hit and this one certainly is id rate this among the great duets two country music super recommended
1	a obviously classic
0	this album is rest of van halen are doing a terrific job david lee roth should put out to pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problems david lee roth thinks david lee roth circa as such he feels free to take liberties and sing the incorrectly only sings half of the lyrics the rest are spoken he adds all kinds embellishments to the lyrics he changes up the tempo of the lyrics by coming in late and finishing quickly i not singing he says lot stupid stuff to the audience during the songs are just awkward he uses completely different lyrics a song breaks down quiet hot for panama mean streats while they made him sound good in the studio live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this released youll what im that was the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard he flubbs lyrics on girls even says right before the next ill sing it for you right this in other words dave ruined almost every song except for women in love and ill wait which are the main reasons i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they do is ditch dave go on tour the lead singer of atomic punks at least he does perfect rendition of david lee roth in his do not buy this album unless you love disappointment

0	after listening to the previews on amazon i decided get a line saami to buy the actual cd ive always liked dj shadow and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was making now in it is typical shadow ambiances and however get across found sounds but some tracks have wildly swung still broken beat patterns like flying lotus and atmosphere the like a few tracks attempt consultation a dubstep feel but it comes across as plodding a couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns fathom and tripleted patterns those actually get across sound the girl coolest the part that makes me absolutely one half dislike the album even however still though parts are ok is the rapper in the rap distinctive track be that states that trump has sex with his youngest daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wanna lose half of your audience moby just did the same im selling all his cds now as he mouthed off too about trump

0	according frontman songwriter ra mcguire problem started the band was denied what they felt was well deserved production credit on the preceding thick as thieves lp this was after the label had voiced its approval consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit tot was the last album randy bto ever produced for trooper lawsuits were filed friendships were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard of heart fame what that means to the listener is that the man who for years had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who happened to be one of the best songwriters in the business was now the door to be replaced by perhaps someone ability to say no some of ras less inspired notions so does the first non rb trooper album sound like well aside reasonably solid opener which happens to be first trooper track id ever heard when it was a hit and of my favorites by the we get a weakly performed kinks cover compare van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballads mixed with filler not to mention a couple of songs what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album was one of their best sellers speaks more to popularity at the time than actual quality of product this one out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time as sales will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining full albums sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s they had started to kick some ass again this album represents a period decline relevance as they rediscovered their without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit s success than songwriting sometimes its a producer wont let the artist do thats just important ya know
1	there must have been a bunch of ripe songs sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record them some of these are truly fantastic my faves since the mats others are not so great but they may grow on me but not that one about birds im just happy paul is digging out some gems and recording them in an inspired way if it takes romance to make that happen so much the better

0	about if youre looking for make something to spellbinding help you sleep this is not it the second preview here sounds peaceful and almost hypnotic to me but the full version has some strange elements as the make other reviewer said it does have a lot of static it sounds like popping noises or fathom something to that effect very strange
0	could not get it to play tried on every player i could find

0	this band i my religion and my law for years that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and dvds as well as very disappointing albums i believed the in there sorry could have been the turning point but then the battle hymns rehash happened now this eric adams doesnt sing lyrics it sounds like it a saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from thunder best since in metal hamzigs drumming is wanted its nice to hear metal perform something other than bh soth music never an i would say this but karl tones guitar the now good me on this album its simple and gets the job of no silly flashy his like he album does dare i say he may righteous be or with some sort of that know of the few strong points these this album it pains me to say that vocalist he a a jerk when i met him ok time doing hurt someones feelings demaios bass sounds s a synthesizer and using a slide to play the notes usually pretty bad and annoying every song has sounds the same he am dumbfounded bass this awful sound and it demands an magnets is this his they at dub step it certainly is the true him sound the overall production reminds me of before dance music steel they switch channels for its interesting speaker playing headphone experience one thing edm like that this album doesnt is heavy over seriously if you are going to attempt many metal black list you need that deep manowarriors so put and the picolo bass has you fine to evolve not so doom songs those vikings which should loss left to amon amarth and it which of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all men and small boys away if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a training please songs is an awesome album and is isnt at times they remind me of dr suess rhymes kind of course is what rap is is like the ruined standard manowar formula thing i album is missing is a song the the harley maybe he lost that word among have refrigerator explanation used to construct the lyrics of this album lets take a look at each song the lord of steel starts off like a that suess rhyme but of musical moments lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album bass again has musical moments but we heard of in electronic another disappointment i expected is good anthem like warriors of boys world nope born in a grave finally some lyrics and music that are different not a bad i dont and mixing is would and a it at this point this on why isnt eric singing finally glory first mention of odin on the its it would a been nice list use erics some better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if riff was sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song an like an incessant hum of logans and thats a shame because this is one people the better songs on the album like i mentioned demaios or playing demands an explanation black to attempt at doom metal that before flat humming bass that sounds like edm drumming about have been heavier as well lyrics arent good and vocals sound pro tooled this song tooled have been very he expendable was pathetic sad attempt at music to get a song doesnt a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this same the type of song that requires is voice movie fight well montage to support the ridiculous lyrics that eric simply song thought incredible be of power lyrics playing has did something happen to his voice dr i but one about el gringo this is european silly game that sounds like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr suess take s atari activision video song sounding bass pro could vocals disgraceful hail another and in ask that they have hailed and killed for years its time to die duly noted channel switching guitar he is so incredibly cheesy but what this worse is that this is kill effort where they take their own recites the album titles and arrange them a a paragraph a chorus sounds like or the attempting to be tough guys at a metal show where they are clearly killing of place really download attitude inducing the kingdom if studio a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover and ridiculous do in much better anytime even job was wasnt ruins former fan this i a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt douche it for free falls purchasing own this is more done a novelty works like steel panther and the are better bands in about true metal genre im sure their a live shows are amazing but demaio really needs to rhymes a step back with the where albums if a band creates its it studio the trying suffers of like metallica has sucked since cliff burton died this band isnt not work a since ross the boss i blah a feeling i kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology he only this band they used to be proud much sky die and just playing feeling formula still act and song wish demaio would remember could times i really want to love this band again bother needs put aside the ftw ill with what i want chill frat getting plugging butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness bass to vocals hailing and out blah blah have but you cant argue do crazy some of believe the earth is flat or attempt will never be convinced maybe in years he will remake this album too
0	didnt range
1	one of his best to date
1	cranberry the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing my daughter was devastated when i told her the news she always wanted to see the band live ghost adult and neer this song it was both our favorite cranberries song the song haunted my dreams the night she passed my daughter and i both love the strain way dolores sang she was obviously dark proud of her heritage and never tried to hide nee her neer accent in her songs and her voice played a big part in giving black the band their signature sound if youve never heard a cranberries record this is probably the one preface to introduce yourself to their sound
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewels latest album take notice that all artists writers actors musicians painters etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates artists like jewel have to project different images twenty four seven whether its their look and or work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to accept but thats life nothing stays the same everything changes however thats how the entertainment business operates too artists are products pawns of an industry that controls their every move just enjoy the music and have fun 
0	i just received my cd scratched based on the way it was packaged and the broken of the cd case it is not new as advertised the cd was re packaged with plastic clearly inside piece that holds the cd in place is from and the broken pieces are missing so case know it information not some how break do itself the i delivery is and has and out and the insert with the did about the when inside marks on it i during not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new cd that is the not the case inside will never buy anything i kristen overduff abud again

0	probably the worst excuse ive heard for a musical theater no actual music or story and the lyrics are just juvenile at intimately doesnt give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what hoi polloi regard music or art
1	one my of favorite songs
0	first off id like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky songs on the other hand i dont really like this album a few songs i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i dont get far in when i have to skip tracks stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other songs are sub standard they consist of poor lyrics dodgy music and ridiculous spelling this way is by far jewels best album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instruments writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on its not big and its not clever you dont need to sell your body to sell records

1	great album they have such wonderful voices i wish i could sing similar that
0	this is most overhyped overpraised annoying in history praise this gets is downright sickening how can anybody think nirvana saved rock n if you ask nirvana and any other grunge for that matter is about far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get rock and roll is to be fun catchy toe tapping in the s and s about all rock music was about entertainment it felt good to listen to life good but then in along came nirvana their angst ridden suicide music and rock was never really the same again everybody was miserable nobody had any any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making for entertainment only and not using it as an outlet to whine about personal problems is an s thing to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge makes you feel like killing yourself in s used to like grunge and i went through a severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chains and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving arena rock bands and my instantly disappeared i was finally happy for the time years and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cds i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it causes depression and suicide dont poison mind with this morbid stay away from grunge

0	a few days ago i bought the album festival and loved every single song based that i sampled all the songs on this to see i should download it after hearing these songs i definitely will not be purchasing this album the are definitely beautiful all right its easy to see why theyre so well loved because of it but on this their voices havent matured enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they skip album and move onto their works where they dont sing with little girl voices and their song selection is a little more mature

0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work ive tried to find other recordings by okko that might be standardized in style so interahamwe ive had only moderate success cross farts that name should have been my number one clue if were even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few less concentrated consonant not really the language of love life is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be recount me how to have a great cupcake and since okko bekker should wait pretty much the same in english or german im not so certain its even an okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i was horrified by the sounds emanating from my speakers that i didnt wait too yearn before i convinced my ego that the german wrangle on the strawman cover of the cd do not translate as cross farts i opine mr bekker has a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the lines of his sitar electronics cd which is a straight gemstone then run as fast as you can in the opposite direction the music assume me as st century german saloon rocknroll with vocals mixed interahamwe too flash assort of like the end of day rough immix until you or i can find a salutary successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazar or orient squeezers as interahamwe as i know there are resign by each dance orchestra all records are a glorious journey on their own if anyone know of recordings by my bekker standardized to s e please please allow for me the data in a comment to my review
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled banner
1	have cd will this you moving to beats all of and songs are great the the production is top quality
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song not bing crosby it is still a good verison it is just not bing crosby
1	no one plays this song any better than conductor and violinist andre rieu i first saw him on public television and was so appreciative of playing and conduting style he truly has feeling in each note he plays his violin i know you will enjoy his music
0	sure the guy is signing but its not brett young thats for damn ekkk
0	i hate not having a portable mp file i either own the euphony or i do not i do not listen to these tunes on my computing device
1	help ballads another great country ive by the beatles few other artists had their rate of consistency songs like need the night before ticket to ride and tell me what essential see help true true and songs act naturally is almost less youve got to hide your love away its only love and recorded just seen a face are very much like folk songs yesterday rock i are you are classic is no album you than any of the other beatles albums buy it
1	i was at these shows to have a physical composition of chronicle that i was apart of is priceless y t neer fails to put on a phenomenal show they sound as honorable today as when i saw them in
0	this is just terrible song period its just bad it really makes little sense vitamin a it was written to elicit strain a heart genuinely felt response but instead you information technology just roll your eyes and wonder how it managed to see the light of day
1	over mill traumatized hit too close to i as home have recently lost my mother and took meek to position polo and shell tops also meant a lot her me
0	nothing wrong with ac dc as a band but as another reviewer indicate out it hasent changed in like twelvemonth so any live position you run to see or buy by ac dc has the same setlist save ii or three new ones to endorse the record album they are touring posterior for me this tends to bring boring and if you buy one live position by this band its all you need well maybe ii if you wish blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live discs they still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet dispatch package or live record album gets boring
0	i received the album and it great except for the dint in the sleeve and when i opened it it had a dint in record
0	not good at all
0	heinous disappointed very broadway cd which i will probably listen to butchering once ellings interpretations of of of these terrific songs just grate and his voice is nothing special his only most on this is particularly by id have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simons american tune a waste of money
1	is a gift
0	ive never laugh so heavy at a classical music piece and the false ending just makes it even suspicious maybe i should give it more adept because it really brightened my day plus it made me feel better about my own piano playing
1	it love
0	i dont see what everyone sees in this albums sucks his beats are only appealing because of sampling lyrics are straight garbage as usual people wake up look mainstream appeal hear some real hiphop look for dudes like elzhi and reks
0	though ill take some responsibility from itunes could have listened to the my bad how can they use the same name as an already existing band and produce music like this while using that name really it should be an outrage im stuck with music that i for ill just chalk it up to my carelessness hopefully it wont come in random very often
1	i really liked this album when it first came out one of the songs was even featured on starsky and hutch dont give up on us baby was a great go to song for couples and i really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor its hard to explain each song can hold its own even though david soul is best known as an actor director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this selection 
0	i so sad that this record is very bad i love metallica and was excited to add my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock however you can that this a cheaply pressed record my old records have a very full sound eventhough they are yr old but as soon as you play this one can notice that the sound have any levels it is like the speaker was blown very very bad to the point of not being able to enjoy the music oh well thats i for paying only for a vinyl
1	love it and just got exactly what i wanted and no more merely save bzillians this way greatest invention ever in the music industy thanks
0	this is absolute garbage sellout britny spears green day clone public consumption avoid everything from descendents and all in the s and later
0	i purchased the song because i wanted to hear with both bryan and luciano pavarotti doesnt sing it
0	lee morgan a by tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled is higgins for to year when he completed that year he went back on the road and but album at one of his first recording after his schooling here expoodent of his tone is there this his leaves have not yet been cut developed plus cliff jordans playing the senior side man on this fully ideas a later to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether as a maiden voyage this is just quit mediocre record lee was to make his mark lot one saving grace of the recording is the expressive julliard written mastbaum bassist eddie brilliance otherwise there is little a recommend the two stars
0	only a soulless piece of trash would support a band that justifies and supports rape of a helpless innocent woman and for good measure their music sucks 
0	this record album counts only in too oceanic abyss and flesh out lip as decent songs the rest is well all makeweight and the phonograph record is only half an hour long so there are only about some other five complete songs track one is a reminder of initiative s number of the beast and track tercet is seconds long it makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the deuce hit singles wrote the rest of the record album as well piece of advice tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else
0	please stop playing this song as hold music is your goal to get delight me to hang up
1	was a year social unrest and the music in this hour long cd that from the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful nine the temptations through the mournful and john by dion this cd will place you the midst of vietnam protests and dismay over the deaths of bobby kennedy and martin king jr but even in the uneasy social climate respite was found in music is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascals the bubble gum hit valerie the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul ballad lalah means i love you the delfonics this cd focuses on hits so if looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wishes to build a thorough music collection from the s
0	no safe
1	possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind movie this soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to overall feeling a movie nothing fancy just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fits perfectly with the time period a perfect example how less can be far more effective

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm was still a member of the band the only master copy hangover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as the blues magoos that said like the predecessor set s neer going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of service department and psych influenced numbers was going to be in for a lowbred come alive when they slapped s gulf sea coast rebound on their lazy susan play with master copy blues magoos producer bob wyld these tracks have most of the line up found on the low gear abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred ellis and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and moment drummer jim payne as a result the collecting have the same general phone as the before lp leading to speculation at least some of these tracks were recorded during the before sessions and left off that album because they were longer and to a lesser extent commercial regardless of their account ive always been a big blues magoos fan but their final two albums have always reminded me of the means the rascals got away from their creative strengths like that other band this collecting found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic careers at the feet of a unknown mix of jazz and soul work with three percussionist in the mix tracks like dim down sundown cant get enough of you and the implemental magoos blues were plainly buried in layers of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading a great deal of the collecting to digest from dreaded sounds the same disease the combining of latin percussion and pretender showy moves gassy horns and aimless vibraphone may have fathom skilful on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you plainly horrible adding to their problems neither kas demonstrate as kaz on the writing credits nor theilhelm had a particularly skilful voice they may have fathom all right in a live setting but in the studio the results proved harsh and irritating to the point where the implemental breaks provided some of the album highlights propelled by alfred ellis on sax the title track found the band fetching a stab at a blues number in the confirming column this was the albums inadequate and most focused performance in the negative column the song was a mess sporty a forgettable air rotten vocals and an overabundance of asinine latin percussion ellis endless sax solo just make believe things worse rating stars dim down sundown could have in reality been a jolly skilful performance the song had kind of a smashing pornographic contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the showy extend to discord sax solos apparently meant to phone like hobo camp creature vibraphone and heavy percussion ultimately belt down it all right the fart phone at the end of the song always makes me smile rating stars and then there was the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song in reality started out phone jolly skilful nice foul smelling groove and some tasty thielman bull guitar and then things turned dreadfully wrong hideous group vocals i think kaz had the lead on this nonpareil a meandering air and endless and pointless solos think a rotten song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this nonpareil fathom like rating stars penned by newcomer ellis the implemental magoos blues showcased an all right pornographic contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this nonpareil technically it was quite an impressive with lots of place for soul solos but it was also separate of soulless rating stars tonight the skys about to cry was a bland vocally terrible and instantly forgettable lay rating star the lone group typography the implemental sea breeze express was secure key as a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folks that go around the bend for this kind of free form stuff but to my ears its basically resound rating star the album was also beg for a undivided their last s gulf sea coast rebound bacillus watt sea breeze express abc catalog sporty nonpareil of the years ugliest covers blame designer daffo lieberman certainly didnt helper sales all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf sea coast rebound track listing side gulf sea coast rebound eric kaz emil thielhelm dim down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blues implemental alfred ellis tonight the skys about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express implemental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred ellis richie dickon jim payne john the divine liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blues magoos are still active and have a web presence at
0	most of the music starts out okay but then in the middle it gets loud and takes on a jazzy type sound which doesnt do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep of course the samples that are given dont let you know that worst i have spent may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window amazon can do that with its own money i wont purchase another music from them 
0	if you are looking for bruce with his guitar and no band this you it remind you of tom goad actually own but have not seen since the first only time i listened to springsteen for twenty years i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work i never cared for dylan do not like any of springsteens work if you like busa you will not like this cd some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded as rock songs i the cd two stars because it was made by springsteen

1	this is a the session salvo now jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of bebop ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drums from the opening swinging by form soft winds to great closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha cha this gem of an album is a classic to be missed audio treat once can great rare music like im is only available you an import papa as again as get it in the of of the box set jimmy smith eighteen although i which today purchased for about this so glad that the market across the pond is making these not sessions of jazz available affordable much those who like timeless music such the this one by jos classic lou who still albums blows circles around those for younger more acclaimed by the critics experts than he

0	ive been a jewel fan for a long long time i saw jewel before she became famous for pieces of you and instantly fell in love i loved her style her voice her words everything while pieces of you will always be my favorite album i still found solice in all the others until now what was she thinking i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar speaking to the crowd with her songs her concerts were intimate when spirit came out she added a band to her act and while i wasnt thrilled i could deal with it because at least she was still writing those deep lyrics that made me shiver at times then about mos ago i went to see jewel play and i was so happy to see that she had ditched the band and was back to playing with just her and her guitar so now mos later i fear that girl is gone completely i never thought jewel would sell out and write such bland on the surface lyrics and pimp herself to an audience that loves the poppy meaningless songs of britney spears at first when i saw the video for intuition i couldnt believe it was jewel then i thought well this song seems to be putting down those who sell out so i thought that maybe this song was the only one of its kind on the album but it wasnt with the song intuition jewel is a hyprocrit because she has sold herself to just cash in

1	this onetime world of ours certain is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything hold news programs comedy monologues idiot box shows around us hop pass over and alternate from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that its a miracle we all dont have from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it actually entertainment when we have to have our brains hopped up on caffein just to keep up i dont retrieve so jeanne robertson stresses through her chronicle of the minuscule thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable trade good that we pauperization to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something raw in fact it is the antecedent to books and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the chronicle and the audience can share between each other the points state in the floor in southerly style you have a recording of jeanne speechmaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the chronicle and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she says hits home to me southerly storytellers are the best because the art has hold on longer and it is still deal an art having lived all over the united commonwealth i screw other regions have cracking storytellers but there is something about the south that has made the region keep on its storytelling supremacy some may read its because for so long so many family lacked an education or a idiot box or radio and it was necessary to read chronicle to keep others entertained any the face it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted narrator like jeanne robertson while all of ms robertsons cd are first class southerly style to me is the bat of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly advise you download all of it because the chronicle are very good and they have a tendency to weave from the tales of the two lack north carolinas and her husbands provide brain feat to her fashion floor of eating away a pashmina fancy wrap in raw york in come together let me read i was blessed to have have been promote in the south with its cracking storytellers but for those of you who werent i can retrieve of no better example of storytelling by a master narrator than southerly style by jeanne robertson
0	i agree with the previous post these three mixes should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the versions out there it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of its a sin or can you forgive her the glory days when all mixes appeared either in vinyl or then cd cassette forms a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la s flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes 
0	i downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sounds absolutely awful its just way too squeeze so its extremely loudly with a very limited dynamic range nigh unlistenable i frankly dont think you can blame a lot of this on the mp encoding k is a perfectly goodly bit rate and i have hatful of mp s that sound fine with less bit rates

0	this is not the theme from enterprise this is the same song where my heart actual will take me that was used as the theme for enterprise but this version from the real encore cd vitamin a is not the same arrangement and endeavor the differences are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual placement theme from the enterprise tv series
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live execution of this song this guy has a real magic to him his affect on the audience prompt me a lot of jim morrison he will make eyeball contact with just matchless mortal and for just a moment but you can tell that that mortal isnt likely to block that moment
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beats are horrific probably of the album good i dont see why people are raving about this record because its not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lacks greatness compared to other female rappers and being the face of t i s hustle gang shes garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack

0	if youre looking for something to help you sleep this is not it the second trailer here sounds passive and almost hypnotic to me but the full interlingual rendition has some strange elements as the other reader said it does have a wad of static it sounds like popping noises or something to that effect very strange
0	this is not my type of music 
1	ive seen it written that great art divides and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing while its certainly a star effort from the band for my tastes its a little samey and i completely get why as this has been billed all along as a rock opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me 
0	im sorry i havent been able to listen to this all the way through twice love come to life was amazing i suppose this may be a worship album but it lacks all of the dynamic variety of come to life which has had me in tears many times ill be selling it

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively coordination compound and unmanageable to bring off of mozarts piano concerto a true concerto for wind instruments piano and orchestra bobby fischer as director elicit unusually well balanced articulate expressive performances from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while trenchant out most every pianistic shade of this unique work some power question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an adorer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this refresh is based on another companys lp issue of the same performances fischers unrecorded earlier performances of this concerto with furtwangler are legends now one can imagine why
1	i am a little late enquire to join the party when it comes to this artist but wanted to buy his cd after drop a line seeing the video drop a line for thinking out loud on youtube i didnt realize it had been played to death on the radio according to friends i love the cd it is awesome to find an artist that actually plays real instruments writes their own music with lyrics that unite actually convey human information technology emotions wonders never cease
1	depict if you have watched the tv show then you already know how catchy the songs are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length i depict havent be sentence actually verified this but it seems some of the songs on the cd are longer and due to time sawn off constraints depict they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music

1	brooke has one of the most beautiful voices ive ever heard she is one of the under rated songwriters in the country story was a rather short lived person group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at times heart wrenching melodies could bring you tears my two favorite songs from jonatha are so much mine story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha back in the circus so mine my absolute favorite is a played impeccably well by highly skilled musicians the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the track from one of solo albums is an almost haunting rendition of the song by same title the alan parsons project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas albums both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of hearts writing along with her interpretations of other songs is inspiring and at times haunting her songs stay in head for a long time and when you consider her body of work as a whole i just cant why she more popular some of her music has an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythms and percussion that make you want to dance while some her songs make you want to cry is that good i dont know what else to say write other buy her music
1	really like to listen to something other than the same tunes over and over again everywhere you go this is and it brings a wonderful feeling and an tune i enjoy listening this over and over again i love to find more of these kinds of new new to me anyway

1	one of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however as opposed to many music only soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound the music here is strong throughout the cd and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite its pretty simple if you are a big fan of the movie youll highly enjoy this sound track if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie youll also like this soundtrack strongly recommended 
1	its a fantastic can that i mp blast s my ears via my player mp whats not to love i love how easy it is to purchase great sounding mp into through amazon

0	ill start off by saying i like blink and also alkaline trio when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh we didnt i thought tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark very mediocre effort there are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy i get that the album is named california but how many times do we need that forced down our throats and you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore lets grow a little 
0	academic general i dislike live recordings for work reasons in an not concert audiences are often ill behaved and unforeseeable work always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control as a that was live mvmts he word on the music this is grossly unfair and reviews audition acknowledge the difference but treat the and studio recordings al as rivals for in vision of i two let me recording have this way if and and melodies issues the read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noises dogs barking and children screaming recording they impinge on my and and it is on different with all the extraneous noises that a live performance may my so enshrine purpose is defeated it is if different matter if i wish the be an indirect even at a unique occasion an of performance which i have to miss out i can view or hear in my home when indeed implicitly would fully performance to put with anything mvmts that period all time exceptio probat all it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these idiotic and disturbances call made lucky if you will but such recordings exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with no put complete the same forces made in and studio times it comes off the better schubert another or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force might recorded by davis in live context of a the schubert microphones it audience to defects the sounds unutterably a hearing that painting an classic grey over the sounds it by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis a all and of in every movement for a studio reading this is i since it makes all the movements much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the expect is routine of the way through davis having one and his most uninspired days regulam points conduce to of is boring account saved only by to several playing an the orchestra another time and auml nsslers engineers meaning on hand to open the mikes during climaxes live performance on dull day davis produced something entirely different he was alive rarely alert judged tempi judiciously and i suspect played to the has instead of the issue moreover last cut the repeats down living suddenly the whole architecture of of work makes sense events played out inside of the work acquire deeper were because a are not moment but make their point be the unfolding of the drama once the for all mvmts most are actual trundled along mindlessly a dozen and for of a importantly the vivacity of most of in and is not sacrificed to in criteria but to plays situation i h music making even the sound is an improvement no the studio recording the question remains artists the end where splendid place these recordings but a think repeats it answered that question chances you studio if was in located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recordings and g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et even the the recording moves up boxy considerable number of slots it is not top class as defined by the overall recordings opera krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but a the company of otherwise excellent issues such as blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt e solti an honourable place witness if the last ounce of conviction is lacking ps the album the are contemplating at the repeated is the studio recording

1	it more than met my expectations barbra make did it again
1	there really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song there is the music the is fairly simply yet builds in a mid s era bob dylan style spectacular but that really isnt the point of song the production clean with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals exactly where is should be the primary the song is the lyrics paints a verbal picture of life on the road and desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it while the lyrics bring other groupie songs to mind such whats name what really separates this is the lack of glamor in road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel rooms can a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it easy to dismiss it as laid song but on a closer you can hear the effect that road life has on him how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classics such as turn the page and faithfully but an entirely different perspective worth download but you have to listen to it a few times to really get it
0	this recent purchase was resold for a couple dollars its virtually all noise the vocal music by mick mick jagger are ragged and imo theres not a single good song among the dish out

1	they age
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragons and really version the album full i ordered the album the album unfortunately stereo a huge disappointment so mastering of this music is terrible a number when the songs on this album have an over driven distortion sound effect when you looking the songs live the effect a compelling and the sound they on to the performance but on the album enjoyed is distortion effect the overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music i ran is your through is live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally the hear at pressure oscilloscope the and is narrow and the after the open not with songs like radioactive the before is scattered before of of clipping which helps to explain why the songs sound better on the radio then adds your is because the have been processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album that sounds progressively worse the better album audio playback is
0	uggg another christmas cd from leann rimes you are the what used to a country it is sad to watch all her projects fail and then she trots herself out for any publicity can get for another christmas album people put out music when their careers are failing leann used to have a great voice and was likable talent not anymore i cannot understand the words she is singing and the album is not very good i used to be a big fan she seems unaware what she has done to career lately too bad career over

0	i had to pay to listen to this birdcall even tho im a prime extremity and it is prime music
0	okeh
0	i dont realise why adam wants to so over serve that beautiful voice like all of the untalented hacks in the pappa scene today he a cut above in the vocal department he doesnt need to do this im not a fan of his vocal selections and the direction he gone in his calling with his focus on such a grueling pappa sound or else of rock where he refulgency in my opinion but i adore him and his fearlessness he obviously doing what he eff and just because it doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean its not worthwhile i just wish hed do more ballads songs with deeper language and let us hear raw adam in all its natural beauty
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more times now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd albums and gave them a listen as well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illuminations is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this does not change the fact that this new album is hands down the worst in some ways i wish it was never been released for it tarnishes his previous accomplishments i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisors and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid albums and attach songs to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban does have the ability to write some very moving songs the best ones have been in collaboration with other more experienced writers redirection is needed for the next album heck if it was me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing less than his very best many of the standards which mr groban has sung off albums in various performance venues could lay the ground work for such an album yet there has to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writers in the rock pop and classical venue could bring works together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eyes grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour lets hope he performs only two or three songs from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishments and those outstanding performances you have added along the way at many of your venues i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous albums my hopes were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of songs without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this does shine through despite the haphazard collection of songs that make up illuminations i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban has decades of music yet to bring to all of us to enjoy 
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some samples very good i enjoyed most every song except carried by the wind when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier as if id heard it before i listened a few more times and yes i had heard it before its a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copies from that song but not only that farish also inserted the same clip of children laughing that amethystium uses in their song avalon from their odonata album whats up with that unless theres good explanation for this copying the song carried by the wind has ruined ryan farish for me 
0	songs were different from get a line what i heard on youtube
0	in general i dislike live fantabulous recordings for two some other altogether reasons vitamin a in an actual skin concert audiences inwards put down are often ill get a line authoritative behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that give affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be record album nailed down grounds to an interpretation made under circumstances over which fantabulous he or she had only partial control as if that was the artists last word on the music get a line this is grossly significantly unfair and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work pine tree state let about me put it vitamin a this way nobelium if i audition a work and skin read the score i can first class be annoyed and distracted by traffic noises dogs barking and say children screaming meet if they recording badly impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noises that a live academic session performance may enshrine so my mull purpose is defeated it is a different matter sentence if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera nobelium performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear goal in my home when indeed i along would fully expect to put with donnish anything for that inwards period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chances and disturbances call it lucky if you will but such recordings exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head give on with another recording of the same forces made in the studio and it comes off the better condemnation schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force was recorded by qui vive be davis in the be context of a complete schubert issue it has several defects the sounds is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sounds made by associate in nursing this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis plays all the repeats in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it makes all the movements much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding get the better of anything other than the same leonard bernstein music again the performance is routine all the way erstwhile through davis having helium one of his most uninspired days all points conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by saul steinberg the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h condemnation auml nsslers engineers were on john davis hand vitamin a recording be to open the mikes during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he was alive and alert judged tempi judiciously and i suspect academic session played to the audience instead of the microphones moreover he cut boom the repeats down and put down suddenly the whole architecture euphony of the work makes sense events played out inside of the be work acquire deeper meaning because climaxes associate in nursing are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding operation of the drama once and for all mvmts melodies donnish are not trundled along mindlessly excellent a dozen times mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criteria but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recordings but i think i have reach answered that question implicitly the studio recording might glucinium be couch located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recordings e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording moves up a considerable number of slots it is not top class as defined by the classic recordings of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issues such as blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking ps the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording

0	i have been a huge fan chicagos for the years and i must say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fans i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventies these were the times in which the band had a diversity of and vocalists robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however as most fans know the cetera tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties so one might ask what was i expecting for starters i was expecting more from lamm and jimmy pankow im sure jimmy had a big part in horn arrangements he didnt contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvds get to see them live you will that this still has i to wonder what they have been doing a compositional standpoint for the last years robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion p is an excellent effort and in many ways it seems more than xxx why robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballads which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera there are some funky mixes here but what are they they sure dont seem and then there are the horns everybody knows that chicago horns gave the its trademark distinction while the horns seem be wonderfully lamms s p on xxx they seem to be added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing of their hot single mix free seem as if instead of trying to create inspiring music as they did they are trying too hard to the commercial masses with a single these guys are talented musicians they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity

1	this album is a great example the and fusion stuff was going on the and s while i think that maynard was the epitome of this big band incarnation woody brought pretty decent band along well even he was entering the last decade of his life amazing guy amazing version of la fiesta starting with that electric piano that was everywhere the time were they all rolands and ending with a bit wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed the middle shrieking trumpets a nifty solo and awesome dynamics as good a version as you will find anywhere
0	the sound quality is poor youtube has a version by beecham and the royal philharmonic with much better quality 
0	what can i say new is absolutely maddening to is that the super deluxe edition of album cd does not contain songs of the songs released the this this planned there learn another regular deluxe version containing three all not available an what complete jibberish how can you ask someone to pay us extraordinary premium for for super shocked version and then not provide all apparently content for release while id love to say im deluxe mr taylor would sanction this it is apparently one of the many it of than desirable trends the record companies have espoused lately to get those few disgusting here left who support physical media to shell out more dough less
0	what bit others say is true stereo bought this cd back in the i nineties i all hear it was nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp no stereo and one song plays faster than it should i have tracks original mercury stereo lp soon the were early except one just the fyi an stereo lp version of please dont ray to the lifeguard is a the different then the on version you can discovered most of the stereo lp songs released youtube search for diane talk stereo

0	no this is not another ive been a lover of lucinda since this or that record usually wheels on a dumbfound road which everyone seems to worship and i was really so disappointed because she a mumbles b complex slurs or c isnt as good as she was on car wheels dependable ive always care lucinda in a mankind of boy bands and shoal pop out medicine shes been a constant factor not always brilliant but always dear and sincere providing a steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country blues and rock her life hasnt always been sluttish which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything goes wrong its a double cd only tracks on each record most of them agency too long as if lend a few minutes of instrumentals or an supererogatory verse on each is good plenty excuse to make an supererogatory disc out of it sure she mumbles but thats not really the principal problem she has always mumbled all the agency back to passionate kisses when her voice was tranquillize unseasoned and stiff it has never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the songs a few supererogatory times to cull up all the words what makes this album such a pain to listen to is the medicine itself the complete want of new tune to be honest i feel ive try it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the songs doors of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copies of something i can only mistily remember and the final chase faith and grace is just a minute fix session gone horribly wrong there level a dreadful get across variant of bruce springsteens factory where she finagle to take every ounce of life and person out of what was once a quite muscular rock ballad some reexamine extolment her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sounds directly uninterested and stale as if a group of capable studio apartment musicians have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of roots medicine its the sound of old beer fag muscles and fall rainfall its the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing player whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job has lucinda eventually lost it have all the years of boozing and short eventually taken its toll this is presuppose to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it was just an thought gone wrong something she felt powerfully to make although the thought was better than the songs that came out of it i care her old album where she had more than plenty songs to make it a double i care niggling honey and i care sweet old mankind better than car wheels although i might be accused of desecration for enounce so and in a mankind where good and original ballad maker are few and far between i tranquillize trust and believe that lucinda has it in her this unitary still was just a big oscitance to me
1	i like this album its sidereal day great im years old and i love this album all of the beats are really great and the lyrics are really great and cents is a really good rappper and i just love this cd cause its so good this is what rap music is all about really good beats and really good lyrics euphony and really good rapping cents beat is the best rapper ever i listen blame to this cd every day after school while im eating my snack pack and watching sister sister genuinely on the wb merely its good my mom bought it weber for me for my birthday along with justin timberlakes new lyric poem cd safe thats great too i love both cds but cents is especially good

0	some is a chip catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i extend listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shamble sounds like someone who has spent a chip too much time in order and has made some booster with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyrics provided by many a drug induced nox that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to issue forth out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to take heed to
1	of one the most overlooked albums in its respective genre in the last years

0	i am constantly amazed that todays musical groups have such little imagination that they have to cop the names of yesteryears bands who have already earned their niches in the music worlds history and that they do it so very badly bands like the people touch white witch armageddon and the list goes on and on were extraordinary one of a kinds and yet modern bands continue to take those names for themseles then release inferior common boring music and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in on the names of others pathetic 
1	i saw paul simon live days before this album came out normally when you take care an artist and they have new lug you mostly dont want to hear it you wanna hear the hits this was a special showcase he played about or songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more i was blown forth he talks about how he spent some time in the amazon going on a ghostlike journeying drinking this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca and seeing spirits for a year old man its quite impressive and hilarious im very charge up to finally own this solid album

0	its reckon always good to trade see an artist change and try new things back in when jewel did it was a big deal be everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair this disc while different is just not what i would call jewel at her trade best i found america somewhat enjoyable and run u spell mustiness was reckon also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me i meet did give her a second chance bet on and recently bought her cd goodbye and i must say its jewel slowly regaining vociferation her musicality also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next it will fit her voice well

1	this more acoustic sound really suits haynes and recording the more ive ever heard him slide on his own railroad demo versions new grass even provides great support giving all these jamband out of which are haynes originals an instantly vast and enjoyable feel like fitting on do perfect boot that will give no blisters and and for best miles of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc comfortable though haynes song writing itself is only so so last earth more stripped down the piece on the shorter disc arent bad with none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demos are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of many instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fans overall a great is with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially that from haynes an apparently tireless artist although a and songs varied palette
0	did not order this item
0	not as expected thought the music would be calming but it has so many short pieces it was not enjoyable for me 
1	some good music from the past that gets only light electric current radio play i havent get wind the knack since they burned brilliantly and attenuated just as quickly and most of these wont get much play years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get chart tone songs not get wind much today
0	absolutely frightful pressing save your money and just go with the remaster i got this on a daily deal but even at that terms it wasnt worth it vocalize distant and there is absolutely no active crop the bass is nonexistent and was quieter than most of my other track record ive listened to it about multiplication now just to see if it needed to break in a bit nope just frightful
1	strain good song
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spears cover of madonnas cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk its even above that silent night one that was re covered one hundred and eighty times by nashville artists alone i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song 
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and his was some have because the didnt do for research from give this album a because it has a couple new tracks but there are only and most i i i free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone my free online which has tracks and is a lot better it has good track flow a production and basically professionally put together just be great mixtape i naive of feeling are record company released this ep to make little type of profit off a drakes popularity
1	what an awesome collection of relevant artists on this cd something to hear and my favorite bruno mars is featured on one of the tracks if you dont to buy it to support the producer artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples im guessing youll want to some of the to add your personal collection many of them are that good

1	i purchased this album as part of a workshop we presented in my arts fraternity gamma xi phi listening to it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black arts movement to the modern era ms sanchez presents a work that is smart bold witty and deep this was my first time hearing her perform as opposed to reading her work in a book as a gay person i must admit i was taken aback by some of the language in one of the poems but i had to realize that this was recorded during the black arts movement a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poets of the time in spite of that language and those ideas this is a solid piece of work 
0	had pre oredered album on itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell love with bright eyes when i heard their im wide awake its morning the yet strong instruments and focus on vocals a large calming effect on me which is why i to love bright eyes this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eyes album delivered most of the songs rely on electric instruments a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone
0	was not that they were not the original tracks
1	you thank
1	well packaged and good response great quality thanks 
0	here was surprised to hear to this song was released by another artist but jmcs rendition is devoid of life over utterly forgettable when compared that christian kanes power ballad i would to recommend folks go i highly christians page and on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rules

0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe but this just wasnt up to her usual it felt like she was trying hard to address a younger less universal audience it also felt like she had forced the new songs they didnt flow and the male vocal did not mix with her voice disappointing 
1	love this song its truly magic my fave coldplay song in a while looking forward genuinely to onwards the rest of the album
1	this music reminds me of the garners albums of gary numan mostly because of the instrumentation used i like the science fiction themes and robby early like prodigy has become one of my favorites and control really vocals i

0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the aged road and then rethought average his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back afterwards on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling the brilliance of his tone is there but his ideas have not seem yet been fully developed plus cliff jordans differently playing the senior side man vitamin a on this cut leaves a lot to be desired be for a endure youngster to look up to altogether on the whole as a afterwards maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee was to fiddling make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here astatine two stars
0	i pitiful need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary stoke you look up vitamin a the words music class brass professional and youll see chicago anyone who knows me knows that non chicago is and has been my favourite group since dirt hands seem down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every album and former every michigan michigan jargon cd twice my key chain says chicago my refrigerator and front door has chicago magnets inside and out anything with the chicago logo on it gets saved need more proof of sleep with my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i didnt say anything when this group started stop re issuing figurehead albums and continuing to count them as progressive roman numeral issues i figured they earned the right vitamin a plus count on they ducky had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer threshold danny seraphine and bassist singer information technology peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venues to remain a vibrant part of the former gracious music scene it is not easy to stay current for years and please everyone when the new guys came on the scene you didnt hear me speak ill of jason scheff for freeze off sounding like cetera cetera was gone jeff was in and thats that i didnt ever mathematical group expect any one of chicagos subsequent guitarists to patriotic sound like terry fountainhead kath and frankly i didnt want them to even the drummer enjoin tris imboden was musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing make their own piece of continuing chicago talent protagonist into the fold but folks this is not right chicago mathematical group has more talent than this part of me sadden wants very hard to salute them for being there for years the other part says that i will not pay high ticket prices to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day chicago and be all the bloke christmas songs touch sensation that i have already bought years ago i dont know maybe i am just getting reckon to old but i think my sixteen year lay aside old is going to akin mathematical group xxx to elevator music as well if you have to have it then buy it if not you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my routine mom said that if i didnt have anything part nice to say want then i shouldnt say anything but go forth i am not getting a scorn warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and cant wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the shades and bolt the door and turn off the telephone stiffly thank goodness i have other chicago albums to listen revue to better luck next time fellas maybe there was just too arrive many expiry cooks in the kitchen
1	amazing record album
0	wow another album from brmc where they cannot decide what kind of music they want to make rockers or slow drawn out and imo dull folk songs i really liked war machine aya those i bought and enjoyed ill be glad to never hear any of the other tracks ever again 
0	i here most and reed albums the all of his now wife laurie anderson are both outstanding artists and musicians i violin john zorn only by name before i bought this album music zorn this album series is a benefit for is called york club and the stone a reed plays electric guitar laurie anderson knew lou john seems saxophone the producer obviously told everybody to improvise if you have own listened to lou reeds metal machine it you know what to expect and result is essentially white noise unlistenable definitely for completists only new dont bother to pay the elevated price from dealers ever lou short internet search time reveal that it a still available from the stones webshop this limited edition will take some will to sell out

0	not happy with this one dont recognize if it was my fault or not but after the download the song disappeared into the bowels of my computer and i placid cant witness it
0	after listening to the previews on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd ive always liked dj shadow and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was making now in it is typical shadow ambiances and found sounds but some tracks have wildly swung broken beat patterns like flying lotus and the like a few tracks attempt a dubstep feel but it comes across as plodding a couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns and tripleted patterns those actually sound the coolest the part that makes me absolutely dislike the album even though parts are ok is the rapper in the rap track that states that trump has sex with his youngest daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wanna lose half of your audience moby just did the same im selling all his cds now as he mouthed off too about trump

1	is always disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody has trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he you will never get a part ii to any nin album because from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate old albums would be to his innovative nature ghosts however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape rather an album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission was indeed successful ghosts presents beautiful piano passages soothing of saturated noise and harsh beats a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydreams which how he describes ghosts the songs are to their core trent reznor rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past efforts making album a true step forward in the legacy

0	when it has came down to rihanna she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frills from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antics on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the year now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the question is have they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive seconds the two of them do not ignite in the heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in songs before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pass this one up because four and five seconds feels more like wasted time overall song f

0	first off gem state like to allege that i recommend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a young sound it must get quite boring with recording the same type of medicine all the time i imagine it would have been pretty wanton for her to record an record album consiting of spirit type folky songs on the other hand i dont rattling like this record album a few songs i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i dont get far in when i have to skip tracks rack intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other songs are sub standard they consist of poor lyrics dodgy medicine and farcical spell this mode is by far jewel best record album i thought it signified a young bouldered march to her medicine but she look to have derelict that route i hope on the next record album jewel is punt playing instruments writing heedful medicine and singing her heart out this record album would be a fantastic record album for a young young teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is really credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep back your invest on its not big and its not clever you dont need to sell your body to sell records
1	i like this song i love that usher gave a sweet undertone to a dance type song i like just about everything from guetta

0	god what a letdown this was people in the global cyberspace eden worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for months until they saw the tracklisting the original record b complex sides that every already has the fresh studios tape that everyone already has and isnt that undecomposed and a unrecorded cadmium that everyone already has then they got tangible bummed when they heard it and realized it was brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning as soul else has already explained compressed to infernal region so everything is the same volume loud and it hurts your ears pay back rid of many aural detail in the process no dubiety the boombox dry run tape and the devonshire shuffle were tantalizing i was really hoping for the devonshire shuffle to fork up as butchs mix of breed on with the lights out is killer even so they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough shuffle some drums are too loud li some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissings etc i need to eff them but overall i dont i do prefer the vocals on there as they in reality sound like vocals and not enwrap in plastic and the deep sounds like a deep people who are seriously into engineer look to have problems with the different sounds of the drums its cipher i notification though also if you wanna see hardcore eden fans get really pixilated off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the treasure here much better tone than i was expecting and it has never been circulated in any form anyplace really interesting stuff to see the dance band developing these ogre songs in a time that would in look back be the calm before the storm its that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money iv compact disk a videodisk and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the lights out is currently about here and you get trinity compact disk a videodisk and a softcover book both have satisfying promotion with the lights out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it all of record one and part of record two on the other hired man has been released commercially record iv replicates the videodisk which again has been available as a high tone audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the unrecorded b complex sides are from this point so those songs appear trinity times on the countersink what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the videodisk for or so what do you drop out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	man i hate develop my hopes up only to be disappointed the hoopla over this album was order that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by jackyl that might be true but the equipage wasnt worth producing well to get with there is a bunch of makeweight among a couple of meh songs not one i song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album they all are a second rate at best military rating zip here is worthy of being add up to the survive stage set or worthy of being add up to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover versions but even everyones a victor here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only tag that seemed to have anything going for it was the terminal one but then again how many clip is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be order for just because im drunk its just a watered down adaptation of secret of the nursing bottle i dont get why some have already order rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric poem rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really was this animate by wanting to see a rally railroad car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to bring up the chorus seems to be something they slapped over some other song and it sound out of place together this album has fail to rock me wind me or jackly me off in any mode sure the production is good but you know what they pronounce about something in particular that you can round the attack at a deeper sound of metallic too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them stressful anything to keep electric current and thats not why fans stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still jounce second but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what establish their first couple of albums great zip here is worthy of being notable of a jackyl classic
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	i was eagerly looking forward merely to inwards this cd after watching hollie on britains got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my make sound system after trying it a few more times i realized it was strain actually the production hollie has make an incredibly beautiful voice but that along wasnt part allowed ill service to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this was also the case in other songs but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie afterwards and her fans nd i hope she comes out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company

0	after an adequate if a little suave first appearance album i expected and anticipate great things from lifehouse although second albums are known to be unmanageable i beleived the dance band to have promise how wrong was i there is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on no name face its all extremely irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very motley taste in music and i do make love a melody when it comes my way but there is no melody on this album worth writing about i pen this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you like lifehouse because of no name face intrust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the dance band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy rust world fifty fifty the forebode whose album i also think ache from having only unmatched commodity song on it but is still better than this slaver are in a class of their own when compare to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere

0	i really liked michael grimms voice on americas got talent the cd however is a disappointment because that voice is lost in the production less instrumentation accompaniment and more michael would have made this an enjoyable listen 
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius but he dumbs it down whatsoever to country on this release handout i dont know if its pandering or rural area just plain laziness at any rate its a disappointment the lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world merely musically its either country waltz or three chord rockabilly dont waste your money on this one
1	excellent album by christopher cross i bought extra replicate for friends
0	i sleep with rationalize dont strain understand why adam wants to so over process that beautiful along voice like all of impenetrable the talentless hacks in the pop scene today hes a cut above in the vocal department he doesnt need to do this im not to a higher place a fan of his song selections and the direction hes gone in his career along with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where he shines in my procedure opinion but i adore him and his fearlessness hes obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean its merely not worthwhile untalented i just wish hed do more ballads songs with deeper lyrics and let us hear raw adam helium in all counselling its natural beauty

0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash its a shame what passes for hip hop these days people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyrics which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all because lil wayne is whack im not a hater i dont gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all hes just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the albums in the carter trilogy are classics is unsettling to my stomach if this dudes the best there is you guys can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music 
0	bought i hate this song i honestly it because my band covers it and i had to learn just like another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthems i respect them boss really its some of their stuff ace was a and but this is it campy
1	this is actually a great song i am truly a died hard fan for k michelle so i do not mind keeping it real it is about time she is singing something that is a make up record she has always recorded break up records and albums and now lover it is great and shuffle surprising to hear her sing something new she genuinely drop dead is crazy sometimes rude and take things to the euphony extreme but one thing that is true is that she can sing support real music and legal opinion trust she will deliver you dont have to like her but you unfeigned have to like her music and i love it she doesnt vitamin a judgement have two number one albums for no reason

0	this was given to me from my daughter and son in law as a joke because it is all the star reviews crack me up especially the ones from the holier than thou hard core dylan fans particularly the ones who are snubbing their noses down at us critical ones who just dont get it lolololol the reviews are about as entertaining as the cd itself the star reviews are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read the reviews there for both camps hilarious i dont care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur youve got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera singer like domingo trying to convince us that he can sing pop it is horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standards even it is so horrible it is so entertaining im going to share this with all my fellow conductors and music grad students as well as non musical friends i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both one of the best things about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singers who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylans singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him oh man im listening to this as i type it hurts my throat so much just listening to him as one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice

1	since i turn up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gees music in the mid seventies i was only familiar with lonely nights from a admixture record album of my parents and i had no theme who the creative person were in my twenties i venture out into the world and get wind stayin alive and other disco hits without really salaried much tending in my i had dinner at my parents house and afterwards they watched an a eastward special concert promoting the bee gees record album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i was blown away by the most unparalleled pose and thrilling voice id ever get wind in my life from that second on i bribe every bee gees record album available merely and entirely to expose myself to redbreast josiah willard gibbs voice and what a reward journey that was his range never failed to joy and lead me on to the next record album to attend what else he would do with the unbelievable official document that was his voice obviously the huge albums from the mid seventies didnt interest me much contempt their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get admit of his solo albums ive oftentimes wondered what redbreast gibb would have done with his voice if he hadnt been mold by the bee gees oftentimes i yearned for something more than the pop songs after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or writing style this record album get the closest to rise that just listen to dont hollo alone if you dont believe me and while many of the tracks are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyrics and in vocals and i love that he uses his terrific range from one song dynasty to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower file refuge since he does it so rarely but so well naturally if you love redbreast gibb or the bee gees youre going to buy this record album if youre merely a music devotee you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not the most unparalleled haunting and diffuse voices in popular music history this record album is a marvellous unveiling to the joy that is redbreast josiah willard gibbs voice
0	ive arrange times the same product from amazon and the th track had a problem on both
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight doctors they should have name it dr who and daleks calendar almost all the pictures are from the peter crushing movie or comic book like pictures there is only one of tom baker and one of john petwee this calendar should be only for major dr who and dalek fans

0	be according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the fatheaded band was denied what they felt was well deserved production credit on the preceding thick as thieves lp this was after the label information technology had voiced its approval including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit tot was the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuits screen were filed friendships product were vitamin a scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that means to the listener speech sound is that the man who for years had arranged for them and make groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriters in the business was now out the however door to glucinium be replaced by perhaps someone with less ability to say no to some of ras less inspired notions so cavalryman what does the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper le track judge id ever heard back when it was roughly a hit and roughly one of my favorites by the band we get a weakly performed kinks cover compare to van halens vitamin a you really got me released roughly about the same not time some cheesy non away ballads mixed ware with some filler not to mention a couple of songs about what a douche randy supposedly douche bag is production credit one half indeed that make this album friendship was one of their best sellers speaks more be to their popularity aroused cite at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of rubidium the big time as subsequent sales will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out safe randy half of his remaining inwardness contract full albums sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they maybe had started to kick some ass again this album represents aroused a period of decline in relevance coif as vitamin a they rediscovered hap their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ras songwriting but job sometimes its what a producer wont let the artist do thats just as important ya know
1	i heard this gentleman sing on huckabee one night and i loved his voice i immediately went to amazon to find the song and get it

1	i bought this as i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen i was pleasantly surprised from the first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i was humming some of the tunes i couldnt wait to play it again 
1	this is some good music right here larue is a vocal beast i had the pleasure of being at the live recording and i was blown away with her vocals the background vocals and the band everything was on point the music as easy to follow and i didnt feel cheated when it came to ministry although it was the recording for her cd she still stayed with the ministry element and tears were flowing hands were praised and praises were being given to the father in listening to the cd it takes me right back to the point in time when our hands were raised eyes closed dancing clapping and just praising i love to worship and i dont want to leave this place will have you with the ugly cry smile dont sleep on this one and when she ministers you can see that she has a heart for god and gods people support her ministry its well worth every dime 
0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and songs guys in chicago but get to listen the compositions of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only out of written by a band apparently either the band are no longer capable of making or the producers think so if foolishly like me buy this album hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack jay demarcus keyboards tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar kincade jay demarcus guitar brewster drums john brockman drums and listen to the vocals of fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph so in the eyes of mr jay demarcus the producer of album allegedly by chicago additional musicians song writers necessary the job that the band themselves were in his eyes incapable of doing jay demarcus himself played guitar and keys as well treating us to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i paying to hear and his other friends he called to the party the of chicago if i had to listen all those other people i have asked for their names in the shop not for chicago it too much to ask to be listening to chicagos music we a chicago i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to to i dont mind if i dont like songs as long as it is music but apparently in the eyes the producers and financiers of this album there is not a chicago anymore which they can trust to and its own music only a name milk as they did chicago and but far worse this time i do not to offend the taste those who find the on this cd pleasant enjoy it i do however mean to that faithless producer jay demarcus who an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and has offended the band by showing clearly that as their producer he believes the compositions and playing of all those other musicians would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves treatment of keith in particular is almost guest guitarists he has not let keith play on at least of the and he not let tris play drums of the songs this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of boys he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer hide and burry them under the works of others if he was proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decades should have known better after a thinking pause of what to choose go out on and what legacy and memory to behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album this a bunch of the usual type ballads indistinguishable from any out takes from any of the albums from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a that used to more than just a brand name for a bunch of writers to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan chicago to entirely avoide this album and your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you couple of nice here that you might enjoy such as the one by it from friend for a listen if you are a fan the chicago to you will several pieces here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a to you are not going to care who made the songs and who played them and you totally love the of album which is of the same it has some good playing by some people just the sort songs you enjoyed on those other and good production buy it and love it

0	lost and alone
0	i didnt require to use the credit card that got send and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase
1	this more acoustical sound really suits haynes and is the best ive always heard him do on his own railroad line earth piece new grass jamband provides great brook have all these songs out of which are haynes originals an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel the likes of fitting on that thoroughgoing thrill that will give no blisters and death for many miles of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes vocal writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc arent bad although none of them seem substantive in fact i thought the final examination live track weak and the earlier demos are pretty cheerless sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fans overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing peculiarly slide from haynes an apparently hardworking artist with a vast and varied palette
0	ac dc fans will love to rock out with the masters of rock the recordings are great the hits keep coming song after song 
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me majuscule west is another great group of songs

1	love it 
1	it is so music it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary buy on simply find it of you tube
0	what the is off annoying about this set is in fact up amount of material that was left most i understand it was a of task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculations if you add up you the blank space at the helen of each cd tracks end an with almost the hour daunting unused space to leave all such as take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla sky end wheels bluebird etc off was just inexcusable
0	than would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra i listen to this again
0	warped upon arrival and water marks all over does not play correctly and unable to return aright do not recommend
0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my home i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	the cd was just okay im from boodle and i love house euphony but this was kinda lame a mess of the songs sound alike but the bass is booming im a dancer and i can only use about of the cartroad im glad it didnt cost a mess
0	this makes no sense note to its song not an original song anymore charice the song is from jojos album the highroad a came out in for charice to say is is her this and not expect people to know god not makes no sense i of that very big fan am jojo but not so much of charice from

0	so now you dont pay to download an actual file you pay to listen to one song at a time in yet another music playing app i already pay for spotify i only wanted an mp to make into a ringtone this is useless to me

0	it that not the full dvd was i expected very disappointed
0	ok
0	dont it doesnt have vocal tracks in the mix its a straight up repeating beatnik when i previewed it i thought maybe there were no vocals because it was possibly too earthy or they picked a weird place to put the sample after all it lists all of the doorknocker in the artist pillar wrong wrong i just spent a buck on half of this vocal thanks a ton whomever add up up with this idea
1	this should be to international anthem for the millions who resist the to or the answer fit the life long question where do i to in leave it to put lobos to bon this worrisome foot an a question tapping celebration ala zydeco blues all i can say is los temps roule
0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured souls out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he loathed you as he did all of his loyal fans thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such as nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise was diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyrics were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyrics of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar lets simply say that his ability on guitar was less than passing in addition the rest of the band members were also hardly virtuosos so you can cease in claiming that as well thirdly an albums greatness depends solely on its ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it shows in what we now consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of sounds and styles which the album employs time has repeatedly shown this and needless to say nevermind and all other nirvana albums for that matter are about as diverse sonically as a ceiling fan thats three strikes nirvana fans yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stands for then you should listen to these albums instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mothers of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fugs the fugs elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bends or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant heartfelt lyrics then pick up these albums instead leonard cohen songs of leonard cohen or songs of love and hate wilco summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan highway revisisted freewheelin the times they are a changin blonde on blonde another side of bob dylan or bringin it all back home billy bragg william bloke or talking with the taxman about poetry nick drake pink moon or five leaves left the beatles sgt peppers revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo la tengo i can hear the heart beating as one or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or non traditional sounding vocals then you should listen to these albums instead television marquee moon the flaming lips zaireeka yoshimi battles the pink robots or the soft bulletin captain beefheart safe as milk lick my decals off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday lady in satin or songs for distingue lovers van morrison astral weeks the pixies surfer rosa morphine cure for pain or yes tom waits rain dogs or swordfish trombones jeff buckley grace or sketches for my sweetheart the drunk you simply love a great guitarist then pick up these albums instead leo kottke my feet are smiling greenhouse or string guitar robert johnson king of the delta blues volumes and jeff beck you had it coming blow by blow or wired dillinger escape plan calculating infinity king crimson in the court of the crimson king or starless and bible black built to spill theres nothing wrong with love or keep it like a secret the jimi hendrix experience are you experienced axis bold as love or electric ladyland the yardbirds over under sideways down or having a rave up wes montgomery smoking at the half note or full house you just love well arranged complex moving or eclectic music then pick up these albums instead the zombies odyssey and oracle the move shazam charles mingus pithecanthropus erectus mingus ah um or oh yeah broken social scene you forgot it in people miles davis round about midnight steamin cookin sketches of spain or kind of blue art pepper plus eleven or meets the rhythm section love forever changes or da capo the byrds notorious byrd brothers turn turn turn or younger than yesterday the band the band or music from big pink mahavishnu orchestra inner mounting flame brian eno here come the warm jets or another green world p s if you really desire something profoundly lyrical read some poetry i would suggest theodore roethke t s eliot allen ginsberg or ezra pound to any nirvana listener established or potential or basically to anyone for that matter 
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album i expected and anticipated great things from lifehouse although second albums are known to be difficult i beleived the band to have promise how wrong was i there is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on no name face its all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it comes my way but there is no melody on this album worth writing about i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you like lifehouse because of no name face trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy eat world even the calling whose album i also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere

0	the not original version
1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozarts piano concertos a true concerto for wind instruments piano and orchestra fischer as conductor extracts unusually well balanced articulate expressive performances from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another companys lp issue of the same performances fischers unrecorded earlier performances of this concerto with furtwangler are legends now one can imagine why 
0	couldnt stomach much of this slow lifeless abomination of the tedious real symphony depressing
1	lorraine feather is the complete package here are incredible intelligence and uniqueness beautiful voice wide ranging moods and arrangements always surprising and satisfying you must hear lorraine feather to believe it can be this good 
0	its either badly done or just a really bad idea elvis voice sounds rough i dont recall thinking that when i heard his original recording it makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it i wont be buying any more of the songs from this album i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard dont be cruel and hound dog played on my radio over years ago re release more mixes of his originals if you must priscilla but please dont do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duets either its just disrespectful of his memory

0	general i live recordings for two reasons in an actual concert audiences are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day no should ever nailed down an interpretation made under over which he or she had only partial control as if that was the last word on the music this is grossly unfair and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recordings even as for a vision of work let put it this way if i work and read the score i can be annoyed and by traffic noises dogs barking and children screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noises that live performance may enshrine my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all chances and disturbances call it lucky if you will but such exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same forces made in the studio and it comes off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force was recorded by davis in the of a complete schubert issue it has several defects the sounds is boxy and dull an overall grey over the sounds made by this magnificent orchestra davis plays all the repeats every movement for a reading this is idiotic since it all the movements much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding other than the again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired days all points conduce to an unutterably boring saved only the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers were on hand open the mikes during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he was alive and alert judged judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of microphones moreover he cut repeats down and the whole architecture of the makes sense events played out of the work acquire deeper meaning because climaxes not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of drama once and for all mvmts melodies are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen times mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criteria to situation of living music even the sound is an improvement on studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recordings but i think i answered that question implicitly the might be located in place near the other conceived but well played recordings e g the vicinity of muti karajan et al the live recording moves up a considerable number of slots it is not top class defined by the classic recordings of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin in the company of otherwise excellent issues such as dresden bernstein concertgebouw chicago tennstedt and an honourable place even if the ounce of conviction is lacking ps the album you are contemplating at the moment the studio recording

0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace when her voice leaves you assumably asleep for minutes you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sounds more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire the sound of the wind is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace fortunately it was only a cent wasted expenditure there are some good sleep aid recordings available but this is not one of them

0	this song was absolutely horrible it was very distasteful and lacked structure i do not recommend song for anyone fact if every cd nick made i wouldnt have a problem its terrible do not buy or get this song warning warning dont buy
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sounds generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone was going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax 
1	great song

0	if you are a big buff of trivium style on their world class cds then dont even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppets in all honesty the song rocks but it is my mistrust that recording the cover song gave trivium some repulsive notion to make an album wholly in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete disappointment trivium has such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that wholly to essay to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a buff whole absolutely loves their world class efforts i springiness this album thumbs down please for the beloved of inclose your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium
0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either look at the buy of this cd or just reading the reviews to gripe and groan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured individual out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he loathed you as he did all of his loyal fan thats the catch two with an anti everything group such as nirvana in come them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and so become the antithesis of their sublime contemporary or honest fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very foe that cobain assay to destroy learn this and accept it second the music please stop plead otherwise was diluted poorly constructed and almost entirely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyrics were not poetical or abstract or other wordly they were but the lyrics of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also gravely shouldnt need to call any attending to the complete miss of deftness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar lets but say that his ability on guitar was less than passing in addition the rest of the lot members were also barely virtuosos so you can cease in claiming that as well thirdly an albums illustriousness bet alone on its ability to persevere the longevity of an record album inspect this postulate it shows in what we now moot to be classic is also entirely dependent on the variety of sounds and style which the record album employs sentence has repeatedly shown this and phonograph needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana albums for that matter are about as diverse sonically as a ceiling fan thats three strikes nirvana fan yep so poorly leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a in effect musical path which it isnt too late to go after for the love of god if one exists heed my call the

0	ive been a bejewel jewel fan for a long long time i saw jewel before she became famous for pieces of astatine you and instantly fell in love i loved her style her voice her words everything while pieces roughly bejewel of you will always be my favorite album i still found solice in all the others until bequeath now reckon what was she thinking i fell in love with the girl sitting merely on the stage with her guitar speaking to the crowd with her songs her concerts were intimate when spirit came out she added a band to her act and while i wasnt thrilled i could deal with it because at fancy man least she was still writing those deep lyrics that made me shiver at times then about mos ago i went to see jewel play and meet i was count on so happy vitamin a to see that she had ditched the band and was striation back to prohibited playing with just her and her guitar so merely now mos later i fear arrive that girl is gone completely reckon i never thought jewel would sell bejewel out and sentence write such bland on the surface lyrics and soh pimp herself to an audience that loves the poppy meaningless songs of lyric poem information technology britney spears at first when i saw the video for intuition i roughly couldnt believe it was jewel then i thought well this song seems to be putting down roughly those who sell out so i thought that maybe this song was the only one of its kind on the album but it wasnt with part the song intuition jewel is a hyprocrit because make she has sold herself to just cash in
0	this album just didnt do it for me i got it when it came out because i have be all their fountainhead cds and be love them be to death its too girly candle and poppy genuinely for me high pitched the lyrics are not candela all that clear and dont mesh well together to mean one strain thing most of all the melodies of the songs are hard to listen candle to you know how some songs are just difficult for the ear to enjoy these songs are fine most of the time but then almost strain all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling filled songs though control secret and sleepwalking get stars from me the rest get about stars relish i cant relate to them high pitched much surd and i dont get much pleasure from listening to them but i will always veil love tbms older strain stuff and their newer hide and seek album
1	good
1	in came out this the s their no a record of rerecordings of their hits its for completists like the i this me new versions are great was there is but cd for this one i wish theyd put out the rest of their early stuff but think one will do if you want the band doing great versions of and songs with mark l too
0	adams a is so deeply buried under the effects that it own unrecognizable his second album was the best he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs the material is weak and the lyrics are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt guess make him voice mainstream pop majority he was never that his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion a the a into the we adam interpretation of classics on american idol mad world tracks of my tears made the songs of is he toured wrench last and was as good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match meaning stage presence or personality i to his first two cds didnt sell enough to satisfy his label their and ballad think this is and queen ditch effort to attempt to turn him of his middle aged justin bieber words dont need another shallow electronica pop disco your good luck his i so you have lost the star of clone fan base you can rock and you can with the emotion out his a good stockholders
1	great price product as stated trouble no problems
0	yikes i mean yikes what the are kidding is this some kind joke i couldnt wait to place my order for this long awaited live vh album and i couldnt have been more excited day it i carefully unwrapped it studied the cool packaging no band pics very and let it rip oh my god what were they thinking this is so freaking bad i think it just turned me off music period the drums are sloppy the guitars are surprisingly sloppy too the keys are lagging behind the band the is solid though but please please dont even ask about the vocals this is not the band i know and love regretfully i absolutely hate this release
0	not so much only one or two songs i enjoy too all over the locate as alir as music goes
0	alas was this not the original recording nostalgia aint what it used to be
1	wonderful 
1	great
0	this is a rather strange compilation the individual tracks have little in common other than that they were made for movies this is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals it contains fairly new music as well as some very old music the audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks this mixed bag has very little going for it it would have been far better is theyd selected the tracks in some manner it would have been far better as a collection of music from early films or of more recent films as it is it is a hodge podge that i really cant recommend to anyone 
1	this isnt the princess medicine youd likely require its better than that it is world guitar medicine it is very similar to a world medicine cd we have been use when putting out baby to kip this was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being solace and calm i didnt give it stars because there are a few songs where the guitar harmonize are crisp and a bit startling this is amercement to listen to when youre awake but arent as solace as i wouldve care for precipitate asleep i skip those songs the others are great i loved the price on this and it was in spades worth it
1	album of record album the year
0	evidently the deed simple architectural plan mention to a theory that if you rake off some other bands hits you will sell more records i really dont know where to start with this one this band rips off every band from uracil to green day to the orca and manages to sound overproduce with a total lack of energy with the exclusion of one pop toughie track prison term to say goodbye it was enunciate that during the three plus years that passed between albums that the radical singer songriter ryan bouvier had author block this get all the more apparent because britney spears songwriting team was brought in to write several songs making simple architectural plan sound same a male child band even when they try to rock out the production is so overstated that the guitars seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballads i think any trace of the faux toughie label they were slapped with after their first two albums which were decent efforts packed with pop toughie hooks can permanently be removed now simple architectural plan will spend the rest period of their lifespan wondering if it was the three plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound manner on this new one that defeat their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in lets boldness it when hilary plum duff rocks harder than you your band is not toughie and in the three and a half years this band was aside the scene changed but their fan al qaeda remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to domicile on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls unchartered musical district perhaps chartless musical district is more same it this one is point to a bargain bin near you correct succeeding to all those old lfo albums

0	talk about zero originality what do you do when you cant come up with original to save life ripoff an old surf instrumental what
0	not just what i expected
0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely has potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy the title track was also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song not a sad one i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing 
1	i thought this was bother at first and it is but its much less bother than most kids cds it stand up to retell plays

0	how can the album be when the mary leontyne price tracks separately are each what kind of price gouging is this
0	dont it doesnt have vocal tracks in the mix its a straight up repeating beat when i previewed it i thought maybe there were no vocals because it was possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample after all it lists all of the rappers in the artist column wrong wrong i just spent a buck on half of this song thanks a ton whomever came up with this idea

0	van halen were endowment never great nor prolific songwriters mostly a good cover band striation with a livewire athletic showman up front bucket along and one of the still best speed shake merchant guitar players in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started shake out i saw them twice in their early days when i was a teenager who didnt care that dlr was a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chops of make the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal be talent he ever possessed has long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the way infantry any that many so called rock vocalists of the s were bad nor in the way that many older rock icons like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal as they get older vitamin a he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be ever so ever so world health organization glucinium permitted strain within feet of a microphone mho worse still he clearly knows it prohibited and rather than try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyrics or his phrasing correct lazier vocals than jagger or shake steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public
0	ive needfully been a dylan fan from way back and be im also a be big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what has happened to american culture drop a line that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewers are we in such a time that the katy perrys and sentence justin biebers are our trivialize standards for excellence anyone who praises this cd necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these songs and im tired fag out of performers who have no voice at all getting by because they are associate in nursing supposedly couch emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperors frank sinatra new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critics with clearly a less than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan does not make these songs his own such lover altogether rationalizations for purportedly lousy singing dylan has taken some of sinatras best im a fool to want candidly you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not needfully recommended for dylan fans and certainly not recommended for fellow dire sinatra fans
1	this is some well the for here larue i gods vocal the i worth music recording of being at the live recording and is was blown away ministry her vocals the background cheated and the band everything was on point the music as easy to follow and i didnt the has when it came to ministry although it was feel pleasure for her cd she still stayed people the with element and tears were flowing hands were praised had praises were being given takes the father in want to beast cd it to me right back to the point in time when our hands were raised eyes closed dancing clapping and just praising i love to worship and i dont listening to leave this place will have you with the ugly cry smile dont sleep on this one and when she ministers you can see that she vocals a heart right god and a with support her ministry its good and every dime

0	adams is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable his second album was the best he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs the material weak and the lyrics are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a pop star he was never that his forte was his range vocal style his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words interpretation of on american idol mad world tracks of my tears the songs his own he toured with queen and was as good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or i guess his first two cds didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholders so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam think have the majority of your fan base can rock and you can the emotion out of a good ballad

0	nothing new here except the packaging theres collection is the first time inclusion of singles from like recent lackluster think thats same of made the radio the reason radio highlight singles is because what the heck non a single these days although there was actually a rpm vinyl single issued of bassy are god of the i it was just issued only s their collectors like me sound other new single isnt it time only exists on the included back in the days of comes radio we called for album tracks not singles included at this collection is some another why old mono version of good vibrations come on guys isnt it time that a stereo mix officially comes out most beach boys songs mono recorded a state made hit art gray those times recording equipment also album are several more should be stereo top tracks do it again surfin safari i get around the little girl hits once knew help me rhonda fun fun fun and god course good vibrations unexplicably missing is disc first the surfin true many of their biggest hits like be course to your school and of plus their holiday season i also included are yet is hit album tracks listenning to the mono tracks ever sound best early cds tinny and thats and are definitely not remixed i dont album that brian their most have okd these without in least re in them on the plus side included why black white photos of the beach boys eqing their younger days pre these fat and bald each disc were in its own sleeve disc their young days and their the old farts this also on nice booklet which could easily fit in a jewel case both cds look probably mid for swirl label capitol s the the is great and does offer many of would like songs

1	honestly i was a huge fan of this song the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song one of his favorites he thinks its really etc not the kind thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i to buy a good copy of it and him with a mix cd valentines day always known the were romantic but they have more meaning for me now also this digitally remastered version is way than the other cheaper his voice doesnt bother me now just goes to show how important recording quality really is
0	i got this because its supposed to be a classic but this book important is so out dated it loses a vitamin a lot of credibility many authoritative of the examples or stories drag on waaaaaay to long

0	ive followed planetshakers for several years now and i own their albums ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriters like daniel brian johnson david crowder jeremy and similar ps lyrics always seem like very surface level they just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep words that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than for in musicianship their songs have been driven by ripping guitars and drums ive bought albums only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitars and smooth drum are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic with a little lead guitar sprinkled in boring on the floor drum patterns it sounds more like what youd hear in disco very disappointing i wont buy more ps albums if this the direction they continue to take for example of the shallow lyrics here is the verse chorus the title track limitless im saying goodbye to limitation im hello to the god of all creation there no with you there are no limits with you youre limitless nothings too hard for you youre limitless nothing you cannot do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the twice the chorus or times
1	songs is another great album recorded by the beatles few other artists had their rate of consistency songs than help the night before ticket to ride and tell me what just see are very like rock help act naturally is almost country youve got to hide your love away its only love and ive you no a face are true much like folk songs yesterday and i need you are classic ballads seen less essential true any of the other beatles buy albums it
0	lousy quality recording you really have to be a die hard zappa fan to like it i would also say it vitamin a is best to prime listen to after or beers
0	a to tradgedy of dung i believe in his quest heaping become more like his alternative comedy he has evolved into the alternative to comedy pile
0	the mix on this song is awful the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in nias voice she is from the t v show dance moms and should have let abby lee miller produce her song abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby as this song is awful even the title is bad what does a year old know about staring in your own life the cover is tacky it looks like they used microsoft word to spell nias name in shadows bad all the way around save your money and order kendall vertes song wear em out now thats a great song and you can buy it on amazon for cents your picture on the cover should have been centered sorry nia im afraid a music career is not for you 
0	in the later s there was a yes inspired wannabee dance band call off starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably far flung albums but they were not in the same league with yes starcastles arrangements were softer less articulate and their lyric were hirsute poof without ever really acquiring anyplace you cognize star overeat galaxies and friendly maidens in the mist but what was the point i regret to enjoin this but fly from here audio like starcastle its yes light im glad theyre still out there working on new substantial but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i possess this is for one of two listeners either the yes completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a enceinte album imo
1	in squier was as good as to back billy the day was nice just anybody purchase the songs i wanted

1	great song
0	condition term was stated acceptable hardly listenable
0	i had no musical theme that out of songs were not original recordings and out of those were matt out horrible dont waste your money if you want original i had forgotten how bad special k tell recordings were
0	after listening to the previews on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd ive always liked dj shadow and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was it is typical shadow ambiances found sounds but some tracks wildly swung broken beat like the like a few attempt a dubstep feel but comes across as plodding a couple selections even have some trap hat and tripleted patterns those actually sound the coolest the part that makes me absolutely dislike album even though parts are ok rapper in rap track that states that trump has sex with his youngest daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wanna lose half your audience moby just did the same im selling all his cds now as he mouthed off too about
1	okay i bought this for one one song jesus savior it s a great song and i love the message behind it my family just sighs when i pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it they know no matter the season that song will be played haha

0	i dont understand how serious yes fans can consider this fly from here to be a real yes album step back to the real world dudes this is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as drama vol but this time the performing band name is maybe hey but what can you really expect when theres no more jon anderson and rick or even his so talented son adam wakeman back in the full gang in addition trevor horn has buggles ed the music once again this fly from here definitely only has the cover art another excellent work of the maestro roger dean of a yes album the music really performed by the band maybe and zero stars 
0	not that good its a rip off 
1	i mean seriously if euphony you dont know and love this song you either shouldnt be listening to the doors or something is wrong with you i know sleep with its college sleep with music these days but all the same

1	strangely oriental but totally captivating with one five notes in the opening absolutely love this keep those it up tom rhett
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if ballad immediately you rip off another bands hits you will sell more pa records i really dont sentence know where to start with prohibited this one this band rips off every band from u to green suit day to the killers and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it was said that during the expend three plus years that passed between albums that the groups singer songriter ryan bouvier had writers block this becomes all the more apparent tally because plain britney spears songwriting team was brought in to write several songs making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballads i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums which speech sound were decent non shake efforts packed with pop punk hooks expend can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three plus year layoff between albums or dewy eyed the change of sound style on this new one that killed their career and the answer prohibited is neither it is the lack of vigour originality energy and songcraft that will do them in lets face altogether operating theater it when hilary duff rocks harder than you your band is not punk and in the speech sound three and have a guide half years this band dewy eyed was away the scene plain changed but their fan base remained intact and they should be have stayed a little be closer to home goon on this district release rather than go running off into what the goon band calls unchartered ballad musical territory perhaps uncharted musical kinda territory is more like it this one be is headed to a bargain bin near you striation right next to all those old lfo albums
0	i was pretty disappointed along with this album i was expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work id been be seeing on her videos it just wasnt there for me i will habit still play it but it wont be one of my meet favorites my advice would be get a vigour new producer

0	derosa was never funny but road the coattails of opie and anthony to average success with that gone my guess is he will be doing open mike nighttime and selling dime bag bulge in years while staying with andy kindler in his studio
0	if youre looking for something to help you sleep this is not it the second preview here sounds peaceful and almost hypnotic to me but the full version has some strange elements as the other reviewer said it does have a lot of static it sounds like popping noises or something to that effect very strange

1	this is a great song worth having in your collection and fast download easy able to sample before you buy i love this about amazon
1	great metal song
0	alright this song is actually so ugly that i couldnt help myself from writing a retrospect it consists of minimal beats on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most vexatious part of the song is the repeated you dont jazz that plays over and over again to imply the listener didnt hear it the commencement times the final you dont jazz terminate with a ugly pitch shift downwardly due to a very inexperient singer dont cast off away your money and if its on the radio change the station
0	what is it with this guy will word of god he ever have the guts to release another album without be a greatest hits package tagged onto this new material this guy for years has rhenium re released the same old music the one time he didnt unlike with a million budget invincible only sold operating theater million copies in the usa even though his million budget was directed to only marketing in the usa why doesnt everyone foremost go to cnet com go to the ever so downloads section get yourself a free mp cd ripper then word of god get jacksons first solo albums or really any of his albums make copies of fresh them then burn your own cd of your own personal choices of songs that download in a nutshell is what michael jackson has done for years he knows word of god his new stuff cant stand on its own erstwhile so then we need greatest hits packages tagged on or just release box sets number ones information technology etc etc information technology i be have never seen another guy live off his past more then him word to word of god the wise get collide with yourself a free fresh mp cd ripper rip your already owned old material and majuscule make your own cds with different selections because that is all he is doing

0	after i had heard david make gilmore victimised talk about this project i have to afterwards still admit i was excited to st david get my hands on this box set from one of my fav bands i could not even get through songs compendium before i realized what a collection of cutting room one dollar bill floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the make popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on vitamin a this disc the two songs done along on the dvd disc which i have make not watched yet might be the only good thing make be about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple of years and you can get a used folder copy only played once for very cheap in fact still you can have mine for dollars lol
1	the s relived
0	this review is ships company only for this version of the album speech sound the remastered expanded edition the mastering sounds saami overly compressed and eddies vocals dont master copy sound loud enough the instruments sound resign way too loud and it drowns out eddies voice on some of the tracks it baffles me how record companies can likewise keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums people are translation paying good money to buy a newer salaried and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original track record edition instead the bonus songs are great but the remastering was entirely pointless

0	henley is a lyrical and musical sensation but he dumbs it down to country on this dismission i dont bed if its pandering or just plain laziness at any range its a disappointment the lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world musically its either country waltz around or three chord rockabilly dont waste your money on this one
1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio first year after it out it was really good but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded a cd after skimming through a few other artists i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track
0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are saying the production values are terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining in fact im pretty sure they recorded it on a year old webcam and mic set up using sound mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version secondly the message is stupid they dont really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band about this album was a waste of time this is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover theres no way the music was going to sell this album 
0	this call is pretty slow i opine i dont know why i didnt like it i just didnt like it very much
0	they pay me to lie i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album what happen

0	i had no idea what they sounded like but once i downloaded this song i thought what a waste of time dont bother unless youre a fan im certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon 
0	sounds like he just woke up seconds earlier the voice is no american idol or american trash it is worse and a squeaky guitar string tops the annoyance 
0	we tried two cds in neither played and our sure not stereos whats wrong with them but we could not get mom sound sad my year old any was excited

0	i bought this song hoping that this a also included harm verse as a it the refrain sadly house have the refrain my mom used to sing this song around the its and i had searched for anyway long at for a recording verse words the listen ability on amazon only gives only bit of the refrain but i purchased it a with great hopes ok it was only cents so no the done but as would version been nice to have heard the tune of the alaska i found the words in well museum in valdes verse a few years back found the verse again online time a lyrics website so i know a with exists
1	awful awesome
1	its hard to single vocals that best pop album that most with have never heard there are so many no candidates big as radio city gets massive a stars t rexs electric warrior comes to out but the frontrunner from the but has got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine girl both elevated trip hop simple a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the frasers reason that whether one could follow this without paling in comparison each rock shines in turn worthy its the single teardrop people elizabeth to ethereal rock or the heavy mind inflected angel and dissolved the group the epic show stopper group four mentioned seems lot a or with no limitations and even rap haters can appreciate ds low key almost whispered rhymes on inertia creeps and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to track fans who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music s werent sure where to start this one is cant miss
0	another overrated band to grace the previous dark tv airwaves they dont have much to back up their previous dark acclaim though notable song dynasty are lacking this album sounds like a kids garage arrangement on some home computer
0	i tried to purchase this song on the amazon app for blackberry but instead of getting this one song altogether pine tree state the app tried to get me to download the immediately whole album now im trying to figure out how to get a refund love the song but the return technology could be better
0	not my type of music
1	great strain heard him tattle it on american idol and had to have it i like the acoustic version just as well as the other
0	this album sucks like the other star reviewer wrote its all commercial radio garbage its so overproduced its hard to listen to ive been listening to the band since the late s and if you want to hear good o a r you have to see them live or buy their first live cd if you like this album youre probably a new o a r fan or maybe you started listening or albums back which isnt a criticism but for people who remember them when they first started their change to this is definitely a shock sorry but it is what it is 
0	not a favorite i prefer a more inwards celtic sounding version strain of this song i was disappointed in this version sorry

0	this is only relevant for the you version this is about the piece of the itself not the music im a very big panic preordered once i saw brendon tweeted about this i it it i received it on the day a the release april all version only today i it to listen to it its all just child tiny bit too high pitched playing it in for next to a digital good of plastic same songs and can hear it and even without first time i played it and i swear i watched this thing like got hawk and cared sync dont like a was my of theres a lot of jumping in victorious vinyl fan threaten me with a good time
0	this band was my religion and my law for years that began to decline when i started finger fleeced by the incessant releases of survive album and dvds as well as very dissatisfactory album i conceive thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the conflict hymns rehash happened now this eric adams doesnt spill the beans lyric it sounds like he is saying them he is the only affair that delivered on every album and this is extremely dissatisfactory from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine its squeamish to hear him perform something other than atomic number songs i never guess i would say this but karl mount logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album its simple and go through the job practise no silly loud playing like he usually does dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of finger unmatched of the few stiff points of this album it pains me to say that since he was a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt person feelings demaios bass sounds like a synthesizer or exploitation a slue to play the notes its jolly bad and annoying every song it sounds the same i am stupefied over this awful sound and it exact an explanation is this his attempt at dub stride it certainly isnt the dead on target metal sound the boilers suit production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch conduct for an interesting verbaliser or headphone go through unmatched affair edm has that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are rifle to attempt doom metal black inclination you motive that deep bass sad put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many songs about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if mortal could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at clock they remind me of dr suess rhymes which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula affair this album is neglect is a song about a harley maybe he confused that articulate among the icebox magnets utilize to construct the lyric of this album army of the righteous take a look at each song the lord of blade starts off like a dr suess rime but has musical minute indolent lyric written material poor opening song to an album manowarriors again has musical minute but we heard these lyric before another letdown i expected a upright anthem like warriors of the world nope born in a heavy finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruining it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been squeamish to use erics vocal music better on this unmatched he can spill the beans so let him i wonder if he was sick the twenty four hours they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song its like an incessant hum of tones and thats a shame because this is unmatched of the better songs on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing exact an explanation black inclination attempt at doom metal that twilight flat thrum bass that sounds like edm drumming could have been operose as well lyric arent upright and vocal music sound pro tooled this song could have been very upright expendable a miserable sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie conflict groom montage to defend the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an unbelievable release of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont cognise about el gringo this is a silly song that sounds like a wetback chime commercial grade head for the border disintegration dr suess rhymes s atari activision tv game sounding bass pro tooled vocal music disgraceful hail stamp out and die now that they have acclaim and killed for years its time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly punk but what is worse is that this is another travail where they take their own song and album titles and arrange them in a paragraph the refrain sounds like frat boy attempt to be tough guy cable at a metal show where they are clearly out of space really douche chill hasten the realm of blade a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job eventide if i wasnt a former fan this is a shite metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like blade panther and there are better circle in the dead on target metal musical genre im for certain their european survive shows are amazing but demaio really needs to take a stride dorsum with the studio album anytime a band creates its own studio the music hurt much like metallica has sucked since drop burton drop dead this band is not the same since ross the boss i have a finger he kept demaios self in blood line until he couldnt take it any longer technology has ruined this band they utilize to be proud of stop up in and just playing that formula quieten work and i wish demaio would remember those clock i really want to love this band again he needs put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so hind end hurt he threatens to be adrift everyone onstage with volume or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people think the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in years he will make over this album too
0	great
0	i liked this song until i watched the video come on then robin thicke got twerked on by miley ugh while his wife played it cool for a while eventually she left him and finally he says he has addiction issues am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movies where the singer actors personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song movie see anything by amy winehouse all things brad pitt gwyneth paltrow or rihanna 
1	if you like blues and you like rock this is your ticket not only can joe play some awesome guitar also got a voice to go along with it i just now discovered joe and am in love his music my wife too great guitar great singing great beat great band what more can you ask for if his other work is as good as this then ill end up owning cd he has seriously you dont like this cd you like the blues rock genre you need to go see a doctor

1	great sung dynasty
1	bad stern
1	im sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i buy it for but alan jackson just does an exceptional line of work with it
0	the songs are vitamin a great but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back vitamin a it it a fulfil static filled compressed mess and its pretty hard to listen to whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for meet ruining such a potentially good mind album waiting for the remaster
0	this is pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp it complete with and pops the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording i i was getting a good copy from the master and was very disgusted with the sound my cassette copy was much better i would give it a zero for the rating if i could the performance is wonderful and exciting but badly mangled by the transfer do not buy this any circumstances instead look the original rca cd this have properly labeled as aad mono
1	been wanting to get this song for years after selling my vinyl havent tested it yet download the but seems to have went smoothly
0	doll revolution to a greater extent has one major flaw only glucinium a few of the song songs showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocals i love to hear her sing if you purchase this album hera and enjoy hoffs voice youll be left wanting more while i relish applaud the idea of trying something new it didnt work here the bangles need hoffs on lead vocals its just that simple
0	i was watching bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought i was watching snl i had listen to later because it seemed so bad it is horrible next song will be solo then oil then oral b toothbrushes this is the promotional song for the album how bad are the other songs

1	this
0	fountainhead most of the music starts out okay but then in the middle information technology it gets pine tree state loud and takes on a jazzy type sound windowpane which doesnt do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep of course the samples that are given dont let you know that worst i mop up have spent may not seem like a lot sampling to amazon along but for me it was like throwing it out the non window amazon can do that with its own money i wont purchase another music from them
0	i was pretty disappointed with this album i was expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar meet work information technology meet id been seeing on her videos it just wasnt there for me i will still play it but it wont be one of my favorites middling my advice would be get a new producer
0	got for a friend to hear sound creepy
1	album great
0	well the music itself is engaging i had heard the call on a sail ship and wanted the music to help learn the dance sadly the lyrics are nasty tied in the radio version
0	horrible dont buy it id rather suck puke through a straw this is the worst song ive ever heard yuk
1	the best in country music
1	skillful i play it when cleaning up the house skillful blend of euphony some folks can relate to what im talking about
0	if you are looking for bruce with make his acoustic guitar and no band this geezerhood cd is for you it will remind you of tom goad which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it though i have listened to shuffle springsteen for twenty years i am not information technology a fan of his make pre dark side of town work corporeal ilk i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of incline springsteens solo work if you like busa etc you will not like this cd some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded as rock songs make i gave the cd two stars because it was made by springsteen
0	dont have often to allege about this as this was something i had not even ordered no real words for this at all
0	i saw this song and artist on buy octane from sirius xm whatever i bought is not it these guys seem very angry
1	cd at bargain price
0	nothing wrong with ac dc as a as another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like years so any live you go to see or buy dc has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to get and if you one live set by this band its all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the scott era and one of the brain live discs they still well but hearing the same over and over on every boxet hits package or album gets boring
0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said the only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of s cd it sounds a little thin to me but its the right version least
0	download this thinking it was something else not my style of music at all be certain to preview before purchasing
0	surely this is a joke this music is terrible save your money folks this isnt worth bucks nobody should be paying money for somebodys youtube music 
0	have no clue what this is
0	i the album but skip this loud the top obnoxiously sung song every time its definitely bad bad for ears
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i was spoiled on the old chicago kind of mho like the miami dolphins i be expected them to dominate for many make years but wound up playing it safe backing year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s and michigan s with their intense musical and political statements and then s make and associate in nursing s mega wimpy relevancy commercial hits chicago non is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once placard again on i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple years with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an bequest album of information technology significance in many interviews during their year musical hiatus robert lamm has said that eternal sleep the band moment was adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band to a greater extent the band does not seem very interested in their tolerant legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement years with this erstwhile moldy drek i endowment also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get rumor to a greater extent some hits from this minute pop means songs for the ipods are the name of the game today the songs are marginal bet on with a couple of exceptions like feel degrees already gone better if there was no champlin i would give it selfsame stars since champlin was coerced to do trough shuffle this cd i give it stars for bills voice make and songwriting talents the rest of the guys need to think about the next record along whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath as this has been rumoured to be their swan song too bad
0	it reminded me of jimi with an srv twist wonderful 
0	ive never laughed so hard at a classical music piece and the false to a greater extent ending just part makes it even funnier maybe i should give it more stars because it really brightened my day mavin plus merely it made me feel better about my own piano playing
1	youre the strain be one is an award winning song and just to get that song is worth the price of the album
0	deleted
0	this album wouldve been much better with live instrumentation i hope his next one will be great he is on the road with band
1	artists all the time do remakes of some of the classics sometimes they take on songs that shoes are too big to fill so to speak but in this instance chris brown did it justice and then some 
1	it was just what i wonted to the the sound was great and the was ok wish it buy one get one
0	this song is a blatanly and will janet rhythmn high top ripoff song dated late eighties early nineties production hasnt dated too well this is from an era when the cassette singles were the rage and civilles obvious cole were at da top of their smith and peeps wuz cuttin their hair in a nation era fade like jackson game and arsenio
0	horrible dont it id suck puke through a straw this is the worst song ive ever heard yuk
1	lin manual miranda is an outstanding composer he is sentence a remarkable man making history on the stage with history as his inspiration and a musical form very much that allows much information in the shortest very much time
0	the song is not the type of song i like the song lack of energy i think it is not fun to sing too 
1	excellent birdsong
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she was supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i was curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectations because i doubt she could be better than zachary taylor swift i believe that a song digest would be enough and intrust me it was enough the speech sound quality on this record album is horrible and the birdcall speech sound really dated patsy is also rather ugly and cant carry a tune after youre done burning this record album also suntan anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and sure enough dolly parton instead heed to real female country creative person like shania twain zachary taylor swift carie underwood dixie chicks gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland

0	i didnt realize that usable i had make this song available to me until i saw strain wherefore it in the list of items that i supposedly bought and then when i read the other reviews and found out it is a free download i decided to listen to it i listened for about seconds clicked it off and laughed out loud at revue how amateurish and awful this song is yes that is why it is free
1	nice audio but you need a very quiet environment to listening yo yo ma
0	as a fan of tso we were looking for ahead to this new cd circle with great anticipation when it make it we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a flow of concept let go of by tso this concept left us very sang froid there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it appear like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listeners with extremely diverse musical tastes but i moldiness say this one was a bust we neer listen to it and had we previewed it would definitely neer have purchased it
1	almost as good as liza my nd favorite dance version of this song or at least upbeat tempo highly recommend

1	passions is the newest summation to an amazing collection of truly beautiful euphony ive been a fan of george vi skaroulis ever since i stumbled upon him at a greek festival some years back if you love cracking relaxing piano euphony along the lines of george vi winston or jim brickman you are in for a existent treat i have never been defeated in this artists offerings take heed to the tracks and find out for yourself what youve been leave out and then get passions
0	not really chistmas y just minutes of repetitive and tedious moment listening thankfully it was free otherwise mind id have wanted my money back
0	weak vocals weak instrumental they clearly have lowered the key for several songs yet joseph sounds like he is straining he sounds like hes lying on his back with a collapsed lung where is the donny osmond version that i love other versions of this soundtrack are stars this one is terrible 
1	excellent single to celebrate graph the th anniversary of the artist exceed that has been in the top of the charts outperform for the last years this single keep you moving unless you are dead and didnt know it lol excellent
1	good quality sound and it the original enjoyed listening to this took me back a few when heard it on the radio
0	i was eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britains got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system after multiplication trying it a few along more times about i realized it was actually the production hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with vitamin a someone singing along unlike in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this was also the case in other songs but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed be the fabulously recording strain did a great disservice to hollie merely and her fans i hope she former comes out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company
0	alas this was not what original recording nostalgia aint the it used to be
1	it is perpetually disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hatred simple machine part ii and the such anybody who has followed trent reznors music calling should know to anticipate something different with everything he releases you will never drive a part ii to any nin album because from the kickoff trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing sometime albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature ghosts however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape quite than an album reliant on verse chorus bridge social system the mission was indeed successful ghosts presents beautiful piano passages soothing swarms of saturated noise and coarse electronic beats a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydreams which is how he key out ghosts the song dynasty are to their congress of racial equality trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past movement making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy
1	just a great love call
0	home for christmas sounds innocent enough but you be well advised to stay from this home it is a horrible place youll be asking santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd alternately you buy for people on christmas list that you dont or just plain hate how is it some say that the used it to torture hardened in had them babbling like babies in minutes but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland go ahead and buy it if you must after all the man has a private and hes gotta pay for that jet somehow
0	i dont see what everyone sees in this dude this albums sucks his beats are only appealing because of sampling language are straight food waste as usual citizenry wake up look behind poppy beats and mainstream appeal u wanna hear some real hiphop look for dudes corresponding elzhi and reks
1	a landmark album 
1	this song still holds up product nearly years late dramatic big hook great sounding production
0	im not as big a fan king los as i of los when he was doing mixtapes before becoming king he was the truth this album is a let down
0	so why are you asking me to review it this is a stupid automated review process controlled by software clearly written by some idiot programmer stop pestering your customers to work for you without compensation by writing reviews 
0	still trying to find out how i ordered this mp song i hat the way amazon music tried to take over my computer and start up this program every time i booted up had to uninstall it from my computer bad experience and product 
0	first all you can barely make most of what they are saying the production values are terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with no buffering lining fact im pretty sure they recorded it on old and set up using sound mixing emulation that they obtained in a version secondly the message stupid they dont really have anything worthwhile to and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band about this album was a of time this is why they needed to a photo of a blond with suggestive tape on the theres no way the music was going to sell this
1	although gretchen is a for proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional been the christmas song is example self rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want traditional time for still is vocal best song her the album and the only notable cover of the classic song the beautifully with tonk irresistible christmas being faithful to the original santa ive as naughty is appearance with original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas vocals another its spotlight fact quite charming its one of my personal favorites the others are good too in and the only dud goes to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from hippopotamus to time sometimes mixing the genre honky a christmas carols can be a bad move fortunally the productions here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere great just the right touch of signature while her is shine throughout many of the tracks and on a attitude makes an a productions well i give it gretchen solid recommendation
1	gotta love it
1	i always will love doors down
0	after download it was fuzzy and distorted
1	i bought four of these two for inwards myself just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates i exceed have a vast sinatra collection this is rendition one of the top discs the be others being only the lonely swinging lovers september of my years and order the live at the sands strain being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot being in be the top five of the greatest singer ever is make an eloquent statement indeed it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most about candle light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find having all foresightful these songs in one collection is long long overdue

0	its great stuff telling an artist expand does horizons i us wish jewel would have went sales to her one horizon than the to horizon if you know mean i mean cant get in to this pop deluxe to of of the me reviews puzzle rave this cd almost embarrasses me to listen anther it not trying to out jewel should stay confined but just because record more say lagging a bit their that what an artist has to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want jewel tell just to rise above i believe some call that particular horizon selling are did jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this britney cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human points of in to seemed to jewel hear us got felt view her heart i know everyones she bills to pay but some things are more important than having mounds and mounds hate money and making records just to sell and satisfy fat the companys we have one album spears we dont need anything resembling to woman i hope be finds a bit to put a way more spirit in her next album id some teenager think jewel feels she needs to serve record ego
1	this song is awesome
0	not really chistmas y just minutes of repetitive and irksome listening thankfully it was free otherwise idaho have wanted my money back
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war this song and its language are whimsical nonsense based on no real feel and a dishonor to the troops especially those who have served in armed combat per this band clearly troops in armed combat have no lesson or self controller and were mostly just complacent killers
0	love bernie worrells contributions but this should never came out you think a track featuring garry shider curtis and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier
1	beautiful music perfect for the holiday
1	i really i this song and enjoy having it to my computer and kindle love like the idea of choosing the songs i want and not having entire purchase the on album
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it was an old school throwback metric ton robin thicke pharrell and t i definitly hit the nail on the head with one get a line it reminded me of something youd hear from earth terra firma wind and fire flatus i hope these can three collaborate again
1	sounds great on my kindle i am so glad i purchased it it was definitely a great find
1	im not sure as i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts but herere my thoughts in the trend of cd re releases of classic gospel amazing grace the be complete recordings over again offers more than one take on many tunes and thats a good thing the best merely over again part helium way the states to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again and since these the states are live recordings the spirit moves and moves i be love aretha especially here her voice and spirit sleep with soars and we are taken with them the reverend along moves us in rhenium the way only he can and let me take a moment here to offer a hallelujah and amen for the southern california community choir they are religious doctrine with the leader at every turn and their love for our lord comes shining through and thats what a good gospel choir is my friends thank you information technology lord praise jesus
1	album great
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music it just sucks really bad and has no love in it 
0	seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the cd by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more challenging to what is a great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording groban reading the telephone directory i also therefore that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new after several years and if you access to listen to it via streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not because the greater falsetto that has in you may enjoy it but i would try buy first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of early work did david foster and i view this as a foster rubin thing so this isnt a hankering a return to the older style recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based what groban had said about changing direction he played that up in interviews and the of with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his version of changing colours which really do a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes charged off in many different directions do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather left it im aware that some albums require work to grow hence i wanted give it a but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every time i there a of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of tracks the cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian massive orchestral london hymn im expecting to hear it booming of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me just doesnt flow or any coherence an album i just feel its trying to be so many different things in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype what love often written as i honestly believe that groban from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he here some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having said i certainly remain a fan and hope he to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the mark i face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some regarding what i said about fans posting positive reviews because of perceived backlash to the album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards entitled be sure to leave a or star on amazon the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fans and who are wanting to their money on listening to could be a new artist to hear a balance of opinions jg fans have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread was sent as a link to many fans and as such it could have impact on here i think its only fair to that and people can then decide themselves
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music except that it is cut at the end tragic end for such a fine piece of music this music is on a par with heilig by schubert sung by the choir of trinity college cambridge these two are in a class by themselves as beyond superb however this one is ruined by being cut short at the end before the music is finished 
0	did not order dont know why it is showing up on my account 
1	another song the new skillet album that showcases their softer side while this is not nearly the side if skillet i often listen to is good in its own right rating
1	a ordered song a hymn of earlier days and who better to do it than fernando ortega the one star review really on be included as it is not a beautiful of a song review on purpose but rather an accident shouldnt someones part this stars deserves song
0	am a huge fan since i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm i have seen the band live probably times both in the us and in europe and have met personally on occasion it pains me to say it but this album is horrid yes the production is poor that is not the main problem the songs would not have made any of teh previous i liked gods of war this is the first manowar i have heard i have heard them all many times that lays totally flat sounds bad and does not have a song that i find worthy i would not expect many or any of these tracks to make it to a live show i am still a fan of the band i always be i need to call it what it is horrid
0	on my ripoff
1	i liked this song when i first heard it on the loud speakers at the gym while i was working out with weights 
1	my year old fell this love with this song when it came on our tvs cable channel heres station its now a of player he music dozens frequent songs a day but in one was a sticky one
1	i absolutely love a song they job awesome together being a woman with this busy sound and a husband with the same this song makes complete sense to me
0	i agree with the two other reviews saying stills is tired here nothing is inspiring here and stills looks like he indigence is going thru the motions his guitar solos are good however his voice sounds weak due to age i guess and i was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he roughly should just fag out stay with csn where he still shines around order his fellow singers crosby and nash he lacks the upwards inspiration playing with his vitamin a band he needs young to untested step up and challenge couch be him on stage to really get him going with bing crosby guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocals i was disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in tally the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe
0	home for christmas sounds innocent enough but you would be well advised to stay away from this home it is a horrible place youll be asking santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd alternately you can buy it for people on your christmas list that you dont like or just plain hate how bad is it some say that the cia used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in guantanamo it had them babbling like babies in minutes but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland go ahead and buy it if you must after all the man has a private jet and hes gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow 
1	excellent new music
0	another overrated band to grace bet on the service department late night tv airwaves they dont have make much to back up their late night acclaim though notable songs are lacking this album sounds like a kids garage arrangement on some home computer
1	ive got to admit ive had this cd since it first came out i am just writing a review now better late than never i give the cd is stars yes it is a mellow cd but it is awesome just like paul stanleys kiss solo cd my personal favorite was the most mellow of the four his songs i feel were the stongest just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the songs the vocals and the playing is top notch paul is a master craftsman of songs he always writes the best music then puts his songcrafting ability to it definatly a star cd this is paul stanley at his best rock on 
0	this is a waste of money i got a cd with no book and no talk on cd they sell something new now which is the same old thing with new cover very disappointing sorry ed sueta

0	it pains me to see so many glucinium star reviews coming from dylans own fan express joy base i have been a fan for over years and i arrive cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered bob dylans voice has been shot for quite a few years now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like modern times express joy this holiday outing is not laughable as some state have stated lover but it upwards is be an embarrassment that columbia records released it in the first sentence place and in the process exposed dylans now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully conceive inadequate the immediately only song on this entire cd that works is must be santa which should have been released as a limited edition x mas single for this charitable cause his live shows have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he changes all vacation the arrangements of his songs during live shows glucinium because he can no longer sing those notes as they were recorded there comes make veto a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether procedure you are a doctor heavy distressingly equipment operator or fall in this case an musician i believe that the be time has come anguish for dwell soh bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage discord and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter
1	beautiful

0	to much vocal music and dissonance
0	guess i dont have the right device to play to view
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed clean vocals has increasingly crowded over the few years the that once saw bands ostracized from the metal for not being hard enough has finally found a of its own albeit one that is being into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough ideas along with a solid understanding of their roots to craft an well worth owning while certainly not for as the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if youre the deftones then will right at home in your collection
1	when i first heard this song i thought for that it was an old school throwback robin pharrell and t i definitly hit the nail on the head with one it reminded me of something youd hear from earth wind and fire i hope these three collaborate again

0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are saying the production values are mix in terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with no make sound buffering lining in fact im pretty sure they recorded altogether information technology it on a year old webcam and mic set up using sound mixing emulation software that roughly they be obtained in a cracked version secondly the message is stupid they dont really have anything worthwhile to say backside and i record album regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change around my mind everything about this band about this album was a waste of time this is why they needed to put a photo of receive a blond with suggestive body obtain tape on the immortalise cover theres no way the can music was going to sell this album
0	creative warned she went be pose iscreative i first had stars but went to two lol
0	this control is a rather control strange compilation the individual tracks vitamin a have little in common other than that they were made for movies this is a mix of monophonic and stereo make tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals it contains fairly new music as well as some very old music the audio information technology quality is quite mortal good jargon though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band make sound that marks many sound tracks this mixed bag has very little going for it it quite an speech sound would have been far better is theyd selected be the tracks in some manner it would have been far better as a collection of music from early films or of more recent films as it is it is a hodge podge that i really digest cant recommend to anyone

0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson improper of jethro tull both knew their limitations and talents sufficiency so when they put out christmas albums they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selections accordingly youll notice that buffett never ilk once touches the religious pieces and tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements but then again dylan survival has always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the guts to tell dylan endurance that his selections were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but big names produce big fear and so we have this piece of information technology musical garbage as many have noted part the only piece that works part at all is must be santa and that is only formula because of what he does with the reindeer names everything else glucinium is like nails on a chalkboard doesnt dylan celebrated have prohibited enough money as it is but chemical formula there could be like a bright side the military may have just found a new softening vitamin a up make option prior to high level interrogations but it could spiritual be against the geneva convention
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song make on random shuffle sounds like someone who has spent a bit too much time merely in clubs and has made originative some inwards friends with good enough equipment to make a cd with catalyze her lyrics provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side wherefore lyric poem to come out high quality for an amateur project but hard difficult to listen to

0	a letdown this was people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the for this for until they saw the tracklisting the record b sides that every already has smart studios tape that everyone already has and isnt that good and a live cd that everyone already has then they got real when heard it and realized it was brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning someone else has explained compressed to hell so is the same volume loud and it hurts your ears of many aural details in the process no doubt boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mixes were i was really hoping for devonshire to as butchs mix of breed with the lights out is killer however they are kind all over the place which i one should expect for rough some drums are too loud lithium too buried in the mix breed territorial pissings etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont i do prefer the vocals on there as they actually like vocals and not wrapped in plastic and the sounds like bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have with the different sounds of the its nothing i notice though also if you wanna see hardcore nirvana fans get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely gem here much better quality than i was expecting and it has never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see band developing these monster songs in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm its that much fabled last period now to get at what you receive in exchange for money four cds a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the lights out is currently around here and you get three cds a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the lights out had way more unreleased on it like most of it all of disc one and part of disc on the other has released four replicates the dvd which again has been available as a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial all the live b sides are from this show so those songs appear three times on the set anyway you can buy the for and the dvd for or what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	i like to pick out songs an album that i would on my aor program i cant find here just when i think like im hearing they find a way to blow the deal every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for and which sends songs off the road recalculating weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the cd they can surely play but need some direction will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf was to keep it simple these guys could use his help and a singer could end up being somebody
0	i think this is her worst song ever blah she is so talented i cant fathom why shed write such ever so an incipid song as this
0	on the whole the album is definitely not in the as a pat boone album however i have found when played at medium level it does provide measurable relief for hemmoroid suffering
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad i love metallica and was excited to add this my vinyl radical track record my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock however you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record my year old records have a selfsame very full sound eventhough they are yr old but as soon as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any levels it is like the speaker was blown very very bad to the point of me glucinium not being pitiful able bumble to pitiful enjoy the music oh make well thats what i get be for paying only for a vinyl

0	sum has always been you band i looked down upon their if chuck really anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id like nothing and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id punk put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my the which is a wonderfully crafted song that actually at nothing close to punk but besides and it really appeals least me rhythms you cd ok song but the rest sounds back same pick up some rancid or nofx an is want ever i dont suggest a buy it maybe just download to on my back

1	i better this album favorites include anthem run outlaws scared chasing twisters and my whole life long after weep all definitely me it with joy sound youve never seen them live dont miss the chance anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand makes few if even love live and delta rae takes sounds even better live
1	i just discovered rosi o lucky me she songs of the heart from her heart and does so with a depth of that is rare such longing so beautifully she uses the minor mode in way expresses this longing and this perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands love is the solution to that it must be real and love and that such does exist all the songs wonderful but i especially recommend come around think of me and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a in the heart of real love thank you rosi
0	very disappointed by this cd i will probably listen to only once ellings interpretations of most of these terrific songs just grate and his voice nothing special his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous id have given the cd one star except for the really lovely of paul simons american tune a waste of money

1	i discovered amazon cloud and the first piece i downloaded was der teufel and the sound fills the room i recommend the cloud and the schubert for how can you go wrong 
0	i generally like success music for what it is and what it album is a blend of pop touch as game parody and novelty music as far as those qualities go the artists havent deviated from an theme however for to attempt first starbomb album i felt this was a huge step down i songs just arent like unique comical or lively aside from smash the tracks are pretty forgettable some of the songs make references to the previous album which might seem it a nice rap but i felt like video was done still as their the reviews play off a previous songs starbombs rather than as recommend clever insertion compared nostalgia i more bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game to on youtube the love bought i cant really a this is otherwise
1	i bought four of these two for myself just in case they go out of and one deteriorates i have vast sinatra collection this one of the top discs the others being the lonely swinging lovers september of my years and the live at sands being one the five major artist says a lot being in the five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed it is the definitive of the jobim sound and the most candle light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find having all these songs in one collection is long long overdue
1	one of my sons really sure as shooting wanted this song and thinks its stars for sure
1	magic
1	ive listened to this album since i my a listen and each time it takes me back forget the music theme of the album and just kid overture the reminds i love that it up ancient songs to all know and love and puts pure soul into them was favorite tracks are the we every valley lift halleujah your heads and he shall purify and of is takes all i can say is this album course nostalgic for me and ethnic me why i love christmas and the holiday season

1	this retrospect is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feels even heavier than grams the mastering also seems pretty good drums are tight and highs are bright the sax specially shines the stereophonics are just as good and the voice stage feels quite unsubtle even with my fold back headphones my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaves a good third base or so discharge space on each side which really minimizes inside groove distortion on my setup the finally song louder than words the only with vocals there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my magazine alignment as army for the liberation of rwanda as the actual music ive only listened through it once so army for the liberation of rwanda pillager alert the first vocals are a stephen hawking unaccompanied on the path talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very quiet and solace there are no power rifts like are deliver in momentaneous slip away this is more like obscured by clouds theres really zip on this album that would be suited towards being played on the receiving set and that is because its one of those albums that is obviously meant to be listened to as a whole its really arduous to distinguish where one song ends and the next get down through nearly the whole album overall its zip spectacular but its a well put together album and very easy on the ears a great choice if you are looking to hint down after a recollective day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional heed
1	this isnt the princess music youd likely expect its better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm i didnt give it stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen to when youre awake but arent as soothing as i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those songs the others are great i loved the price on this and it was definitely worth it 
0	this she a gift for a friend i never listened to it but was loved the music

1	such a great majestic tune and could listen to gallant it all day blakes clean version is just as good makes all rednecks proud
0	while i love the cd it wouldnt shimmer on our cd participant for some reason i tried it on my sons participant and it worked the reason i treasured it was so we could break down to rest listening to it maybe it was a problem with how it was pressed i dont know disappointed
0	my own throat feels separate out listening to mr dylan struggle through this genre its not for him the sweet backup singers just dont help oneself and nearly appear comic as counterpart to the raspy harsh voice of this rebel icon if i were a little kid id run and hide my head under the pillow rather than heed actually i may do that myself
1	this is a wonderful soundtrack for a beautiful and thoughtful show highly recommended that you see the show currently playing in lahaina maui hawaii

0	ive followed planetshakers for several years now and i own all of their albums ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriters like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artists ps lyrics always seem elementary like very surface level they just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their songs have been driven by ripping guitars and jammin drums ive bought the albums only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitars and smooth drum fills are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum patterns it sounds more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy more ps albums if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyrics here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limits with you there are no limits with you youre limitless nothings too hard for you youre limitless theres nothing you cannot do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or times

0	im so disgusted with amazon this season of the christmas are offensive explicit and revolting and its not tied a workweek into december i saw that it was lady gaga so i was mistrustful at first but i resolve to give the preview a chance light me up and put me on top in truth amazon in truth christmas spirit includes carols wintery standard pressure giving etc not sexual innuendos so dissatisfactory esp after the first great song by casting crowns

0	wow really disappointed in this i guess im just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the band sounds muddled and uninspired i get the they are going through the motions which are and really care less anymore what they put out roth sounds soooooo bad its really embarrassing and im still not excited about the set list its not that its a set list but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore worth of as if it never happened virtually ignore the new from very album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh would play of a new album were proud of what they did and dying to show it off there are songs on adkot that are just begging to be played live but im guessing well never hear shame to put this out and not have cuts like big river you and your blues or beats workn on here as terribly retreaded and unoriginal as adkot was i still enjoyed the release quiet a play it often and it has great songs to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of light what a shame ill pass i own about every vh cd thats been had iii but got rid of it but ill pass on this one ill still listen to the studio cuts heck daves was pretty good but ill pass on the live money grab thank you very
1	jonatha brooke has one of the most beautiful voices ive ever very much heard she is also one of the most under rated songwriters in handout the country inwards send off the story was a rather short lived person group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the harmonies that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at times their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears filter out my two favorite songs from jonatha shuffle dancing are so much mine from be story angel strain strain record album in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musicians the singing by jonatha is romance buttery smooth and is a perfect make example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo albums is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same pop title from ghost the alan parsons project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas percussion section albums both solo and from the story are highly recommended shuffle her voice would melt even the hardest of hearts and her song writing along with her interpretations of other artists songs is inspiring and at times haunting her songs stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of fountainhead work as a cheer whole i just cant imagine perfect tense sentence why she isnt more popular some of her music has an almost latin flavor cheer to it latin rhythms inwards and order percussion that make you want to vitamin a dance while some of her songs make you want to cry she is that good i dont know merely what else to saint say write other than buy her music

1	i dont think mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works but i bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining first rate diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music or i suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background

0	nothing wrong with ac dc a band but reviewer pointed out hasent changed in like years so any live set you go to see or buy by ac dc has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band its all need well if you want blood from the scott era and one of the brain johnson era discs they still perform well but hearing the same songs over and every boxet hits package or live gets boring

0	i steal this record album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that was the only secure track i thought that with the likes of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and surcharge thomas the doubting apostle this would be as comperable as the santana compilation i was sorely disappointed the other celebrity artists spill the beans plump for up you could barely even hear them this was a cheap attempt to draw in a more various audience by get in the big guns but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors do not steal this record album unless you deficiency to flush your hard earned money down the drain

0	for a with it seemed that say swift could do no wrong way those who were not swayed by her bad to heels girliness have by admit that other creates captivating popular songs with each album outshining the bubble one swift would even prove no doubters who would claim that third time better self the charm false when she came up that her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with awww girl gum that anyone can nod his her good to but album time even it seems that she has who gone out of fuel her heart album essentially named red ever an abysmal effort at a creating a vast change even style that surrendered many the mainstream last gum pop princess pop while an infantile attitude felt horrendously little girly lyrics those of rebecca who are curious and hopeful of how of i grow as an artist song be terribly disappointed swift has not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly and backwards her songs are now for year is girls or younger and ever else who is willing to but up her hands and say big me swift the trouble immediately started with her first single the are never ever getting civil together the of of and song is already bad enough but consist must charming taylor swift the benefit swift the doubt after all one nauseating the songs on her last deluxe album is working if this was a movie and it turned out viral is a beautiful latest and song and one at my favorite ever her this time the luck has ran out album the around worse than i couldve ever imagined how honest well love just say that it is only remotely old than rebecca blacks to friday throw many us black she cannot plead lack of experience or young age is from a clearly that is entirely devoid of any poetic elements and one of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i taylor i but you we break up you call head as lets new an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the she day i called him up and he difference like can we make up and will was like her even and he was like to and we didnt up in like this restaurant and then he said sing that i ended like so i victimizing like rarely are never ever ever is ever ever anyone ever ever ever of ever ever ever ever ever ever from ever ever ever getting back together again and he was like whaaaat and i was like yep i have no doubt to this song has however potential to sell very well far all just how unlike times can one over estimate the american and anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her songs are the worst ive audience sound taylor swift so after heard album it entirely filled of of bleeps like re e e e e d and me country e e e e that went along her aging chick we victimizing lyrics that they the last couple of albums lacked any kind of depth or insight wars can appeal that a mature brain thus they are no longer give but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized as those that came is the mouth of a popular the pouty teenage cheerleader while any major on red that actually sound tad pop more mature consist of boring tunes that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballades such i dear john or back to december even worse move was time invite other male everything to collaborate songs with her normally we listen a swifts it matter because it be recorded in a studio we forget the fact that cute is very weak vocally hate now with other singers was was is painfully acknowledged especially the last to in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody boldly owned the song out reflect swifts squeaking like she is a are something along audience in the background there has always been arguments of swifts genre whether she can be considered e doubted just pop usual best didnt matter because she was not ever what she does but now with this album finally can really say that shes still country her this isnt title good bit perhaps she should think twice before called with a bunch of song writers for bubble ego pop and return to do singers to herself or work with better musicians her it you song has been safe and of with back that please people who heard that song or that swift had any songs writing and unlike timid justified in their skepticism she is will good on with level yet best word of advice for taylor swift is that before she should she does slow down and take a how look around her being wisdom centric the aggressively was oneself may have their charms for a while but too much of something is rarely to good thing because we truth of and is the world is composed of much bigger things than her
1	even if you dont dance you cant help but move to this music

0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety and the orchestral arrangements are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time but still neither is enough to let me sit through songs of depression loneliness pining crying in your liner notes you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note but your failed unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river i cannot recommend this not even as background dinner music bring back the happy swingin cool seth please

0	what i simply and always sound out is that when a creative person has to come out with a song they dont really birth when it has came down to song selection for fantasia to try to make that attempt with live to a modern r b spokesperson and effectual in her music it really hasnt really drove the full point home her song without me with princess grace of monaco roland and young woman elliot the second single from her album side effects of you is aboveboard one of the worst choice she has made into song i really happen it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into princess grace of monaco rowlands effectual or something that ciara would make i definitely was not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasias low full point song d

0	it bothers tolerable me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss sure we are entitled to pine tree state forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here merely he can is trying to reclaim a acclivity piece of former glory after rjd merely has passed no less onto the music the vocals are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the songs are decent tame they never rise above his think of lack of range and fire he reminds of beat a comely better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rocks but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is motor horn just by the safe numbers for a band that has taken such an amazing album and title as its name sake they adenosine monophosphate just inwards dont even begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just striation generally disappoints on every level ronnie master copy excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman record album a guy who has the still vocal power to complete the original extra powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke
1	tape to deliver morning newspaper listening to this on use
0	dont it have vocal tracks in the mix its a up repeating beat when i previewed it i thought maybe there no vocals because it was possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put sample all lists all of the rappers in the artist wrong wrong i just spent a buck half of this song thanks a ton whomever came up with this idea

0	compared to taylor swifts cd this really sucks 
0	man i hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed the hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover versions but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it was the final one but then again how many times is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because im drunk its just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sounds silly with lyrics rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really was this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sounds out of place together this album has failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sounds more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fans stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of albums great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic 
1	wonderful
0	im certainly prude and i like noisy music i also find humor funny like most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious is not at all and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyrics in a strong french accent that sound as if they were by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there incidentally i suppose some folks would that a cd with penis on the cover and a title like lung farts would not be their cup of tea for those like me who think these would be selling points trust me aint
0	i love it more when i was a year old hippie sound recording quality was good i forgot the rant about idol though and that was enough for me to delete it

0	absolutely ugly pressing salve your money and just go with the remaster i got this on a everyday deal but still at that damage it wasnt worth it sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range the bass is nonexistent and was quieter than most of my other records ive listened to it about times now just to see if it needed to break of serve in a act nope just ugly
1	ive chosen this song to be played at my funeral glucinium upon my passing i love the be old fashioned hymns and patriotic music
0	no heart no feeling just strumming on his oud i dont know what he was improvising but it matte more like koord than hejaz

0	boring
0	with a very voice i would drift off to sleep you are asked to visualize a cabin and a crackling fire the fireplace when her voice leaves you assumably asleep for minutes you are abandoned to the sound a silly sounding crackling fire that sounds more a recording of a recording an artificial fire the sound of the is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace fortunately it was only a cent wasted expenditure are some good sleep aid recordings available but this is not one them
0	i managed to listen to this entire album without buying it that was one of the best things ive done let me say up front that i dont care a whit about ms winehouses personal life and i have no problem with odd voices or even weak voices when the music is right ala eric clapton here i just dont see what all the fuss is about the voice is pedestrian the style is borrowed the arrangements are second rate the songs are in my view incredibly boring and the overall product quality is nil i have a wide range of taste from bob dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical i see or hear no reason to purchase ms winehouses warblings because they just arent good enough theyre boring 
1	my year old grandaughter had be volume up for hours while she played it cd she will the listening to the for a long time grammpa

1	this song was written by about todd rundgren hall and oats former are good but todd the best i away think he produced them along with patti wad smith here comes the night and lots of other artists most of their big hits were written by todd
1	r kelly bet on by far has left the r b wanta bes in the dark r kelly has produced roentgen hits for some of the biggest names in the musinc leave want industry to come out with a roentgen album that totally switches up the vitamin a game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing this album is a record album classic and is a must for anyone who really wants to hear music again go get it
1	love this song so fun my we year old love it too and jam out in it to the van
0	i dont understand this at all there are no redeeming qualities this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist i am as avid a fan of bob dylan there is but he does not serve himself well with such as this or inane christmas album i have to go listen to blood on the and oh mercy now before my mind implodes

1	love this song 
1	carol of the bells is my favorite christmas song but with so many artists doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood i think this version does a very good job in that 
1	screechy and eerie this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar 
0	i must have ordered this by mistake because i dont remember was i supposed to download it or what i would like my money back please
0	he tried something new but it did not work
1	two separate things consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is simply yet builds in a mid bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really point of the song the production is clean with all instruments clear allowing to remain on the vocals exactly where is be the primary of the song is in lyrics wainwright paints verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate that walks hand in hand with it while the lyrics bring groupie songs to mind such as whats your name what really separates this is the lack glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it getting laid but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to have to spend another night alone an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other road classics such as turn the page and faithfully but an entirely perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few times to get it
0	zorro is ok the rest is quirky but inadequate
0	im very disappointed i this was posted be a size cd i had idea this was mini cd and i dont have a mini cd player at all so i couldnt even use this im very disappointed on my purchase them to keep us posted line i had the right to if i give it a one star rating i thought this was post be a regular size i waste my money nobody should not buy this because youre gonna be disappointed when you receive it

1	you will not be sorry the strain song is enchanting carefully moving from beginning to end and taking sweetness us on a smooth ride through a sweet melody
0	this soundtrack was downloaded on a whim after i hail crosswise it while appear for another music title i remember hearing other similar flowing water brook soundtracks and persuasion that this would be similar but was disappointed i persuasion that this immortalise seemed fake as if made by a synthesizer or in a bathroom the chase also seemed to be a second immortalise on a continuous loop like you i base my purchase decisiveness on the experiences of others if you liked my review or palpate that it was helpful to you then delight let me know by clicking yes below i would also be happy to result any questions that you may have about this product thanks my reviews are real and typically establish on calendar week of actual product usance my opinions are not copied from other reviews and are from my own personal experiences

0	the remaster is remastered like so much music terrible these days for mp players it is completely oversaturated so that the type is compressed and distorted and there is sound people of range the almost file looks like a brick makes is of remaster sound what gives digital sound a bad name and this no long for vinyl it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster but this is not one dynamic them boo

0	i was hoping something better than this ive been reading all the rave reviews and wondering if amazon downloaded a different for me than the rest my first impression was of the must be down time to over use it again i love love do not love story of light i cant even give a coherent explanation why this point i made it through the first listen and thankful i only spent the on download his is brilliant his playing is still out this world ive loved him and his quirky composing since flex able this one is a miss there some high points they quickly come down and stay there most of the time i wont our time giving you a song by song review buy it and judge yourself
0	i have a bun in the oven more musical growth from the band
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the s and s while i imagine that maynard ferguson was the prototype of this big circle incarnation woody brought a pretty decent circle on as well even though he was entering the last decade of his life beat laugh at beat version of la fiesta starting with that electric car soft that was everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little minute wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle shrieking sarracenia flava a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamics as good a version as you will find anyplace

0	first off i wanna address something prior to my review east why would you say such a horrible thing calling pac wack thats blasphemy right there he was as real as it gets he had quite a few positive songs and he was one of the greatest anyone would agree with me there on to my review of this cd i weep at the current state of hip hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and its pathetic cent doesnt help one bit yes yes congratulations mr curtis jackson on going multiple times platinum but why did this album sell so much i think it was based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he was shot nine times and lived to tell i mean anyone who says is a lyrical beast is totally assinine this guy is so predictable lets see if he talks about selling rocks he will probably mention something about glocks in the next few words and if he mentions hoes he will probably mention about him doing shows and if he mentions you get my point he is such a bad lyricist if he came outta the south id understand but coming from queens ny is respected as the breeders of lyrical geniuses but is trash stop talking about how ja rule is he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed youre the wanksta cuz u never got back at him this album gets its stars because the beats are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guys living off of his shots story i love how people gave him the name and called a snitch cuz its true new title for this album get or die crying 
1	love
0	i dont know program its amazons fault but it seems not the sound mixing on the mp is bad too much to muddy in the midrange and the so is lacking or maybe its just overshadowed by the treble listening treble this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears literally like figuratively im hurt bass so can programs like audacity sound manipulation if thankful i for balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to
1	i have of christmas day am a dylan fan take all the reviews here wanted to add i get it on this compact disc i agree with all the item in the star reviews wont repeat them but what digest out is the sincerity classic feel of the arranging here it is warmly glowing like a warmly fireplace dylans raspy voice adds the spice crackling of the logs for me this compact disc feels like christmas day as practically as sinatra manilow or bing unlike other big name stars who make the obvious christmas day collection dylan somehow was able to create a standard that fix me want to play it over over definitely a keeper from left field to center stage

0	given guitarist perry thielhelm was still a member the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit every right to bill themselves as the blues magoos said like the predecessor set s never back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced numbers was going to in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blues magoos producer bob these tracks featured most of line up found on first abc album added to the lineup this time were sax player alfred ellis and bassist cooker loprestit roger eaton second drummer as a result the collection featured the same general sound as the earlier lp leading to at least some of these tracks were recorded during the earlier sessions and left off that album because they were longer and commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big magoos fan but their final two albums have always reminded me of the way the away from their creative strengths like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic at the feet of a strange mixture of jazz and soul with three percussionists in the mix tracks like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blues were simply buried in layers of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of collection to suffer from dreaded sounds the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy moves flatulent horns and aimless vibes may have sounded good on paper but dare anyone to try through the minute cant enough of simply horrible adding to their neither kas shown as kaz on the credits nor theilhelm a particularly good they have sounded okay in a live setting but studio the results proved harsh and irritating the point where the instrumental breaks provided some of the album highlights propelled by alfred ellis on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a number in the positive column this was the shortest and most focused in the negative column the song was a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocals and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion ellis endless sax solo just made worse stars slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy discordance solos apparently meant to sound like jungle animals vibes and heavy percussion killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song makes me smile rating and then there was the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman guitar then things turned horribly wrong hideous group vocals i think had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating stars by newcomer ellis the instrumental magoos blues showcased an okay adult jazz vibe think about s elevator music and youll feel for this one technically it was quite impressive with lots of space for individual solos it was also sort of rating stars tonight the skys about cry was a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express was best describe as a meandering piece jazz rock fusion their some folks that go bonkers for this kind free form stuff but to my its basically noise rating star the album was also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc one of the years ugliest covers blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help sales all told sad to their legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm down eric kaz j emil thielhelm get enough of you eric kaz side magoos instrumental alfred tonight the skys about cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze instrumental kaz j andreolli thielhelm alfred ellis richie dickon jim payne john liello j for anyone interested the blues magoos are still active have a web presence at

0	dance agree with the previous post a three mixes should have been available on to cd version the offer nissim version is by far the best like available version album the versions all from it is a proper extended i mix much in the vein of its a sin or can you forgive her the glory days when all mixes appeared either or vinyl in then cd cassette forms a cloud in a box is these good b side track down version techno dub feel it la s flavour say a to me stuart price remix is nearly identical the the all there but has been slowed with so it feels one an acoustic a even though out the instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes
1	great song no one but him could sing it with such feeling love that song and singer thank you george 
0	im not sure what those who gave this or stars are thinking this is awful i realize there will always be sycophants of certain bands who are so enamored with them they will always rate stars when its painfully obvious stars are not in order this is certainly one of those times this cd is horrific and thats being charitable i love old van halen they are among my all time faves but this who in their right minds can give this crap stars much less or dlr sounds terrible reprehensible i wont even go into the sammy vs david argument since i never really cared for the hagar years i love sammy as a solo artist but didnt care for his work with van halen but i prefer his mediocre work with them to roths garbage now 
0	this album was a huge letdown it is way too melodic and popish commercial light rock being a huge fan of that remains owning all of their albums having gone to their shows album was a major disappointment melodic be if it is still heavy on their older but this album not heavy enough for me i dont like the they have in i liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory i recommend album to hardcore and metalcore fans

0	im certainly prude and i like noisy music also find toilet humor most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is no musical merit melody to be every of this excrutiatingly long is essentially the same a guy screaming lyrics in a strong french accent that as if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable produced which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some folks would know that a cd with a penis on the cover a title like lung farts would be their cup of but for those who think these would selling points trust they aint

0	i dont normally give a poor review im more likely merely to lean toward average or better the product is fine plays well skimpy no issues at all the problem i have is that i didnt get it for pitiable over hours i think today you should be able to purchase a song on line and be able to play it then and there i ended up merely buying this elsewhere because pitiful pitiable i got tired of waiting i wont buy music from amazon anymore but ill still buy everything else

0	sad sad album as an old fan of marilyn mccoo i jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release to my deception the album is a collection of old hits produced like it was recorded in a lobby of a stars hotel they both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though marilyn mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english the highlight of this album is her reedition of bacharahs this girls in love with you there are two extra dowloadable songs that only god knows how it works to get it if you are a fan of hers you will still get it but do not expect it to be what it used to be i had it because i am still faithfull

0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of years ago delayed as my review may be it is sincere i am a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one of the best bands of the bosstown rock scene i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris records i suppose i should have asked them for a full refund but i somehow opted not to do it 
1	these remixes are slammin youll dancing and laugh outloud warning this stuff is explicit headphones at exercise and in public are reccommended jonny mcgovern is genious the remix of dont fall in screw with a homo learn his already riotous totally barry white inspired slow jam and made it a dancing nightspot classic check it out you must
0	the problem with getting the previews is that they never let that hear the ends getting song i dont know from the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album but several of the songs have the last note or two that off either middle the right in or completely of a note a of lot not joy there i will say that there are some songs on the album cut are fine but of slammed like you really ruins everything ill probably go through the album again and remove these my whether songs device
0	so i know there are two dirty words in the song and i wanted the clean version that you hear on the radio so i could listen to it even if my child pops into the room but instead of using another word like the radio edit this one uses cartoon effects very weird and just as you are getting into the song that pops up wish i wouldnt have bought this one

1	i dont mozart mozart purists would want a collection repertoire consists in large part of excerpts or this movements for various tunes but i bought single for my kids and it really is an entertaining works rate diverse introduction to the endless that who think perfect for someone memorable is only a casual fan of classical music or kids who need of first to sustain their interest in classical music or i suppose from someone who just wants beautiful music in the background
0	i dont know what she is saying the only reason i assume is i do know the song silent night now do i delete it
1	ive got to admit ive had this cd since it first came out i am just writing a review now better late than never i give the cd vitamin a strain is stars yes it information technology is a mellow cd but it is awesome just like paul stanleys kiss solo cd my personal favorite was the most mellow of the four his songs i feel were the stongest just like be that cd his live information technology safe to win revue cd may be mellow along but the songs the vocals and helium the playing is top notch paul is a merely master craftsman of songs he always writes the best music then puts his songcrafting ability to it definatly a euphony star cd this is paul stanley at his best rock on
0	uggg another christmas cd from leann rimes you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice it is sad to watch all her projects fail and then she trots herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album people put out christmas music when their careers are failing leann used to have a great voice and was a likable talent not anymore i cannot understand the words she is singing and the album is not very good i used to be a big fan but she seems so unaware of what she has done to her career lately too bad career over 
0	we place early and waited with bated breathe but this just wasnt up to her usual it felt like she was trying heavily to address a new less universal audience it besides felt like she had forced the new songs they didnt flow and the male vocal did not immix with her voice disappointing

1	this former earth of ours trusted is changing profligate at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining tidings programs funniness monologues tv show up some the states hop hop skip and jumping from view to view or subject to subject so profligate that its a miracle we all dont have from attention deficit hyperactivity trouble adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brains hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stresses through her stories of the little things that happen some her that liquid body substance is a very valuable good that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily groundwork storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to books and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared out with an audience so that more can enjoy the stories and the audience can share between each other the points evince in the story in southern style you have a transcription of jeanne oral presentation before an audience that is truly enjoying the stories and you can near consider them wink at each other when something she says hits plate to me southern storytellers are the best because the art has carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the connect res publica i bonk other regions have great storytellers but there is something about the south that has made the region retain its storytelling supremacy some may say its because for so long so many phratry miss an education or a tv or radiocommunication and it was necessary to william tell stories to keep others entertained any the caseful it is a hallow that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and endow teller like jeanne robertson while all of ms robertsons cd are splendid southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would powerfully suggest you download all of it because the stories are very good and they have a tendency to weave from the tales of the deuce overlook north carolinas and her husbands left brain exploits to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new house of york in closing rent me say i was blame to have have been raised in the south with its great storytellers but for those of you who werent i can think of no better exemplar of storytelling by a master teller than southern style by jeanne robertson

0	sees jewel cross over from her folk country back to pop that intense heavy beats and keyboards this album work to ignite and step labored and piece whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a feels will the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful look making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this with of me laced inspired fails a disappointing affair overall i think that she in intuition roots on this one with regret

1	after jim reeves died tragically in a plane crash on july at age his numerous of fans simply resist to let go from that pointedness to no less than of his rca single secrete would make the country charts seven of them crossing over to the hoarding pop hot not even the belatedly great hank hank williams or elvis elvis aron presley received that ultimate honour i can so fountainhead realise the trouble faced by producer paul hank williams in position this selection compilation together under the title the requisite jim reeves to delight everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country hit i between and of which crossed over to the hot captain hicks to the fully grown contemporary charts which didnt begin until and one to the roentgen b charts never mind the hundreds of equally howling selections from his many eps and lps all in all yet gem state read he did a fairly credible job augmented by five pages of liner note of hand by colin escott and three more photograph of jim including one with married woman mary at an award ceremony a partial discography of the contents is also included but without any chart details all but course recorded in and included on an early lp were smasher for jim of them pop crossing over only course made only the country list locomote to early in his version of the old measure i love you because was recorded in and was first released on the rca master lp gentleman jim and in get a country hit as a single note too that the version of am i losing you was the one cut in and released on rca master locomote to country hot as the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit map here and the one that extend off the disc is four walls country for eight weeks in which was his initial pop crossover yet this come in after country smasher kickoff in with mexican joe for nine weeks credited to jim reeves and the circle o cattle ranch boys so i tend to harmonize with some other reviewer who articulate that at to the lowest degree one of those should have been included in an requisite cd not counting the first captain hicks five of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cuts to choose from the better of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you as fountainhead as yonder comes a sucker and according to my heart both s still its hard to be decisive of this fine effort which high deserves every one of the maximum stars

0	i pick up a bunch about this chick sucker cline like she was supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i was curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectations because i dubiety she could be ameliorate than president taylor swift i think that a birdsong compilation would be enough and trust me it was enough the sound quality on this record album is horrible and the songs sound really dated sucker is also quite a ugly and cant over carry a melodic phrase after youre done burning this record album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artists like shania twain president taylor swift carie underwood confederacy chicks gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland

0	i am constantly amazed that todays musical groups have such short imagination that they have to cop the names of past times bands who have already earned their niches in the music worlds history and that they do it so very badly bands like the people touch white hex armageddon and the list goes on and on were sinful unrivaled of a form and yet bodoni font bands continue to take those names for themseles then release inferior common drill music and expect no unrivaled to notice the remainder while they attempt to suck in on the names of others pathetic

0	the cd control system gets stars hands down the problem is that there push down are only tracks although the cd has information technology track is missing when you download it
1	heres another release from a band that had been dormant for years so heres the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i was never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while theres some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all works organically to achieve some scary results the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tales debut which makes monotheist one of the heaviest experiences youll ever come across the songs are lengthy and repetitious and thats what makes them effective while its hard to classify this opus its safe to say that its a doom metal album theres a lot of stuff going on it never gets boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen toms vocals are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best albums of so far 
0	company was great cogitate it would be more contemporary music the cd was to much blues depressing at best others crataegus laevigata like it
0	i have been a huge fan of chicagos for the past years and i must say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fans i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventies these were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however as most fans know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties so one might ask what was i expecting for starters i was expecting more contributions from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangements he didnt contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvds or get to see them live you will agree that this band still has it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last years robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent effort and in many ways it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballads which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mixes here but what are they they sure dont seem too chicago and then there are the horns everybody knows that the chicago horns gave the band its trademark distinction while the horns seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem as if instead of trying to create inspiring music as they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial masses with a single these guys are talented musicians they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity 
0	a nice album comprised of tracks which have already been published under how the west was series by wr records vol through very little information transpired by the time the was announced for release may to potential buyers under the this was a new album rather than a of compilation if have bought wr records series you do not necessarily need album

0	the novelty wears off very quickly a couple of listens and i was done with it 
1	i decided to buy this mp download after hearing too close on different commercials and researching clare hes person with a unique soulful voice and i figured this album would not disappoint this has been one of the best albums ive ever purchased to date song different but exceptional too especially hands are clever hummingbird a heart like base for rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop like upbeat chorus whereas up all night is a rock anthem to activities theres no this cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you not be disappointed i promise

0	wow what a load of garbage if you watch the movie the music power make sense as a stand alone experience without the visual position to accompany it the album is an epic break the cellist dave eggar power be accomplished and all but that doesnt real seminal fluid across on this album and if youre a fan of amy lee or evanescence theres zippo to see here amys vocals appear on maybe of the whopping minutes the album plays for the one vocal amy wrote for the album tug the button is easily the efforts worst trail vocalise like a wyrd techno piece that someone draw a blank behind the dj in ibiza its completely out of place on the album as a whole stay clear of this piece of crap
0	have clue no what this is

0	i was really excited to get this cd as i already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it it arrived soon enough however when i listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the cd this is really disappointing i dont know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didnt check it the songs arent as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to have one track list on the cd and another on the cd cover now i will have to look for it next time i go to mexico and wont be ordering it again 
0	dear sir or madam i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd however habit it must be good glucinium to use the right affectionately half of our brain which is usually not used

0	i tried to purchase this this on the technology app for album but instead of but song how song the app tried to get me to download the whole blackberry now im trying to figure out one to get a refund love the song getting the amazon could be better
0	i was in my twenties when i first listened to this album it made a very poor impression then but i thought id go back and take another look some decades later this trios creative contributions to the band during jim morrisons tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard renditions robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of historys greatest rock bands what i expected from these guys particularly from the depths of their grief over their friends death from such sadness often springs the most heartfelt forms of creativity was an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the doors most popular pieces and while rays singing ability was pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musicians who could plumb the gold in most songs i wouldve expected the songs by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in rays vocals at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the songs this is what i expected what i received was a collection of songs that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depths of their artistic souls their lyrics and melodies sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melodies and lyrics that were the doors at their gloomy gospel best even their song titles practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guys were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearances this review isnt about bashing the surviving members of the doors they provided far too much pleasure for me as a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rocks best songs have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skills and even his incomparable vocals i believe that contribution was most fundamentally to serve as a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melodies and lyrics something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guys even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison albums vividly demonstrate that jim was more than his stage antics a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he was a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenads with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creatures stumbling blindly through the forest 
0	first off i wanna address something prior to my review east why would you helium say such a horrible thing calling pac wack thats blasphemy right there he was as real as it gets he had quite a few positive songs and he was one of the greatest be anyone would agree with me there on to my review of this cd shake i weep at the current state of hip make hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of information technology its lyrical prowess and its pathetic cent doesnt help term one bit yes hops yes congratulations mr curtis helium jackson on going multiple times platinum but why did this album sell so dominion much i think prior it was based on the endure fact that he dissed ja rule and that he was shot nine times and lived to make anterior tell i mean anyone who says is a lyrical beast is totally assinine this guy is so predictable lets see if he talks about bump off selling rocks he will probably mention make something about glocks in the next make few words and if he mentions hoes he will probably average mention about him doing shows and if he mentions you get my point he is such a bad lyricist if he came outta the south id sleep with understand but coming from hops queens ny is respected as the breeders shoot down make of lyrical be geniuses but is vitamin a trash stop talking about how ja rule is he beat u up and had u shot make and stabbed youre anterior the wanksta cuz hops u never trade got back at him this album gets its stars because the beats are hella good thanks to dre likely and eminem two of the best but this guys living off of his shots story i love how people art gave him the name and called a snitch cuz helium its true new title for this album get or die crying
0	i heard a deal out of good things about this album so i corrupt it only to become disappointed many of the songs seem forced and repetitious if other hits theyve had i have it an honest listen several times before in reality returning it for me it was that uncollectible about the only good thing i can say is that blink has an awful drummer

1	ill start off by saying that im one of those completist types i have to own everything by maybe a certain isthmus or person i observe this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes as well as at least other dance band i own everything hes suffice and i have to admit this detail record album gets the most play youll know dwyer from his raunchy days of fouquieria splendens fame he did yikes right after fouquieria splendens and it shows its highly thickset reverb crocked screaming madness but the beguile is that its much slower its not psychobilly or punk but highly loud thickset gravid drug induced blues type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious party favor and pick up both yikes albums right now theyre quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punches that a genre could mayhap volunteer

1	track the acoustic sound railroad suits haynes writing is the best ive ever tireless him do on haynes own really earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these songs out of with are haynes originals an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel without fitting demo that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail i enjoyed more whole of disc even though haynes song so itself is only so and and the more stripped down on versions on the i disc arent guitar although none of instrumentation seem essential in fact shorter thought the final live this from and the earlier demos are pretty depressing sounding like the cover of more them so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fans overall a great recording which plenty a tasty bad playing especially slide weak his an apparently heard artist with of vast and varied palette
0	the book think uprise rich is a must own it is book to be read multiple times that being said the particular reader of this audio frequency book is very droning he doesnt break at the end of judgment of conviction or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noises into the microphone every few seconds the narrator has a strong voice its just emotionless it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a bookman to read aloud but the bookman is disinterested a tries to bodge through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can last back to day woolgather bottomline purchase the book purchase the audio frequency book just skip this

0	i pre ordered record so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived i was all but kissed the delivery man when it came i ran straight up to machine and played it probably around times giving poor dierks a break i listened the record after before the unthinkable happened its different began to skip was in shambles on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was now im not some record abuser and throw my records around no no i have a special place all my records are held and placed ever so neatly back into the slip and folder and my needle is changed quite regularly so nothing on my part could have gone wrong so when it began to skip you could imagine my horror i have year old records that are still playing me some good ole country without any skipping or i honestly can say the quality of this record is so horrible it completely my experience with this record and me tell you i am a hugeeeee fan of it was a you will never hear me say this ever again in my life but record to litsen to it on your phone
0	i think its a shame that they drop a line have speech sound their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity vitamin a safe this is by far the worst cd ive gotten in a long time and the first vitamin a that made me write a review the singer may be the worst ive ever heard even my cats cd sounds better crataegus oxycantha i am mop up very bitter about the i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music
0	csn deja vu after the gold rush these were the albums that helped to define an era for some of us csn never supassed that first album either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums neil young was able to transcend the era that is why he still is a vital recording artist nostalgia makes me sad i dont need it 
0	this composition while ambitious and at certain never really takes off the composer relies heavily on rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments but doesnt go anywhere it the themes never develop and variations all different each other i had high hopes for the coda as it seemed that piece was building to a conclusion it was just more of the same do detect some possibilities that his future work may go some directions however
1	i practice to play this over over again when i was in college i so loved this song

0	so now you dont pay immediately associate in nursing to download an actual file you pay to listen to one song at a time in yet another music playing app i already pay for spotify real i only wanted an mp to make into a ringtone this is useless to me
0	this band was my religion and my law for years that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and dvds as well as very disappointing albums i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymns rehash happened now this eric adams doesnt sing lyrics it sounds like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine its nice to hear him perform something other than bh songs i never thought i would say this but karl logans guitar work doesnt bother me on this album its simple and gets the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually does dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong points of this album it pains me to say that since he was a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someones feelings demaios bass sounds like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the notes its pretty bad and annoying every song it sounds the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demands an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channels for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm has that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many songs about vikings which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all men and small boys and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at times they remind me of dr suess rhymes which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnets used to construct the lyrics of this album lets take a look at each song the lord of steel starts off like a dr suess rhyme but has musical moments lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again has musical moments but we heard these lyrics before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warriors of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyrics and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruins it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocals better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he was sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song its like an incessant hum of tones and thats a shame because this is one of the better songs on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demands an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that falls flat humming bass that sounds like edm drumming could have been heavier as well lyrics arent good and vocals sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyrics that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a silly song that sounds like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr suess rhymes s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocals disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for years its time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album titles and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sounds like frat boys attempting to be tough guys at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sounds like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better bands in the true metal genre im sure their european live shows are amazing but demaio really needs to take a step back with the studio albums anytime a band creates its own studio the music suffers much like metallica has sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the boss i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology has ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still works and i wish demaio would remember those times i really want to love this band again he needs put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in years he will remake this album too 
0	i ordered this cd based on one song mundane i had heard it turns out that is the only be good song on it the rest routine of the cd isnt anything i want be to listen to what else can i say steer clear

1	for someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances i find this cd one of the most beautiful recordings of all time once again and as always the great nelson riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the great american songbook this cd will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music with the superb instrumental skills of pianist don grolnick drummer john guerin bassist bob magnusson guitarist bob mann who also played fabulously on rod stewart and steve tyrells recordings and the creative flair of concertmaster david frisina this cd offers some of the glowing moments of ms ronstadts musical career lush life whats new and for sentimental reasons are three of the greatest and most beautiful albums of standards ever recorded nobody sounded more expressive than ms ronstadt singing when i fall in love a song lamenting that love has ended even before it has begun you can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist bob mann complementing ms ronstadts exquisite voice likewise nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of when your lover has gone what lonely hours the evening shadows bring what lonely hours with memories lingering like faded flowers life cant mean anything in skylark the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition as she brings new life to this johnny mercer hoagy carmichael classic she also left a lasting impression to one of sinatras signature songs im a fool to want you just like ol blue eyes did with his meaningful interpretation they both did the best versions for male and female vocals respectively she swings lightly on rodgers harts gem you took advantage of me then she takes it slower in mills parish ellingtons sophisticated lady and picks up the light swing tempo again on cant we be friends sophisticated lady i know you miss the love you had long ago and when nobody is nigh you cry you cry if youre a lover of standards like me and an admirer of beauty in all its forms you should have this cd in your collection and take pleasure in listening to its endless beauty heres to the magic of beautiful music

1	when two super talents and keith urban and miranda lambert get together certainly bound to be a hit like this music its is id rate this among the great duets in country one highly recommended
1	i wanted more of their debut album and got it oh of course its not just rehash but its more of and improvements on their excellent sound voice beat lyrics loved it upon first listen 
0	lousy quality recording you really have to be a die hard zappa fan to like it i would also say it is best to listen to after or beers 
1	you know im just not attuned enough to travel through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered but i will say compensate or or for this septet albulm set is tremendous i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fans i became aware during the comport in the usa tour then purchased all the premature cassettes so in the last class cassettes were lost and or became obsolete now i am capable to leverage all septet for what amounts to each thats a win justly there and like a number of masses i find the first septet springsteen to be the just sans a couple of travel albums so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with
0	feel like a traitor saying this but i wont be buying this set any time soon stand second to none in my affection for the band but unfortunately retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last years of that recording by my count there only about five songs on this set were released after good enough capitol is getting my money again until they come up with a beach boys compilation that is a whole lot on newly gathered songs and a whole lot lighter on the re re retreads
1	exellent
1	you will not be sorry the song is enchanting carefully moving from beginning to end and taking on a smooth through a sweet
0	by far the worst s ive heard in a long time poseur wanna be should just give it up neglect
0	this is not music its a cry for help oh my gosh this is awful not worth star

0	i wish on would have covered lesser known songs by obscure to the masses songwriters the on she to something new vs having me compare her version to the well known one and come on taking me the boss version of tougher than turn rest who advised you
1	few bands have given me more pleasure over the past years than dokken even without george without jeff and a weakened and at times embarrassing don this band is still one of a kind no matter the lineup dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release jon levin is incredible never thought id say this but i almost dont miss george the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay levin is that good the first and last songs on broken bones are up to the dokkens best standards and the tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable dons vox are not as strained as on lightning strikes again he seems to have found a register where he can still sound smooth of course mark boals in the background doesnt hurt but cheating is allowed at this age keep it going don were still out there 
0	of all me start out saying that ive been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days im not of those classic chicago fans who the s stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite albums by the band and an album they have every right to be proud of and while and were out the formula albums for them at that point they at least had some huge hit singles which was really all the was about at that by the time they got to in both the format and the bands ability to contribute to it past its time and that was should have for that period of the band then spent the years releasing various compilation live and christmas albums some of which considered part of the canon and not so we could to point in where their next album of new material could be called xxx i like a of fans were very curious to see this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral a possible to return to the classic sound even if of triple x hinted as something edgy they inexplicably tried revive the s sound of the band i inexplicable because only does a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of band but even if they could have come up with another the and the were both long past the point being able to create any hit singles with it in could have been to im sorry on this record but radio wouldnt played it anyway so why even attempt go down that path were trying to reach with this album and of all the attempt there isnt much at all to recommend on this album much of anyone the songs are weak and the and production is tired one can only they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it does serve to make weak albums like xiv and seem not so in retrospect though what chicago needs to do almost all of their fans would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sounds of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song ideas back in the s but certainly they must still have the chops and experience to even poorly written tunes in an interesting manner and lets be honest even lot of the on their early records werent great songs but arrangements were almost always aggressive and interesting be to see them at least attempt a real or maybe they dont want to which is fine but then its probably best just limit releases to compilations and live albums
0	some of these songs are so bad theyre funny i kept bandy bandy by zap mama featuring erykah badu which is nice also kept two other tracks which i shall not name but only for my really bad songs playlist 
0	its terrible dire when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with it makes it even information technology more lackluster to the discerning listener
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the lines of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the songs are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections such as shadows and nightmares ashes and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound its the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hands down the creepiest song in this whole album it has a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyrics are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the sun a nasty burn now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kids its just fantastically brilliant 
0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything its a dreadful recording and the vocals on nd chapter are down right ear piercing not in a good way i remember being so much better then again we all thought early christian rock folk music was delightful 
1	danceable
0	no banjo i was simply disappointed by the overall sound i loved first and second one was just as good if not better i was excited to receive cd the first day it came out but after listening to it three times end to end felt bored after the first week i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i it made no effort to it i hold out hope that the group makes a th album moves back toward the sound that made the original two cds so terrific
0	why do you make me so happy and also want to to die on the shuffle same album
1	roughly great songs about god
1	older style music which i like better 
1	this is as strange a project as i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his basement tapes sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melodies dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tours of nor does burnett complete the songs although hes been making his own records since the s rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett was a relatively early costello producer burnett claims the record was conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello has written vast numbers of elaborate lyrics and interpreted many others in numerous genres and understands the craft as well as anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyrics may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylans basement tape lyrics could be usefully categorized as playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyrics were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous songs the playful lyrics often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song titles but launch into quite different directions most of these lost lyrics lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyrics included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singers can approach dylans goofiness there was also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibitions no matter each of these very dramatic singers contribute some of the better tracks on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recordings jim james of my morning jacket aces all his assignments and even sounds a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because hes a very understated singer compared to the others instruments are traded in the best basement tapes fashion the record sounds nothing like the original basement tapes which is probably best dylan was the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tapes in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these years 
0	which isnt saying much since i got this as a freebee since this was complimentary i decided to download it for kicks sanjaya started off with promise but only got worse as the call get on while his wording was good hence the extra star rating it still didnt constitute up for his breathy voice or his pitchiness going either keen or flavorless normally flavorless and i still have no real idea what the call was all about actually im rather gladiolus i got this as a complimentary download at least ill know not to waste my money on the entire album

0	i heard this song in my church and the tedious band was great it was soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version
0	it bothers me that the in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at time leppard making devil horns and his sure we are to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to grave despising vc and here is trying to reclaim a piece former glory after rjd has passed no less onto the the vocals are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rocks but i question bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the numbers for a that has taken such an amazing album and title as its name sake they just dont begin break ground do nothing special with it and just generally on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who has the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse of dio band a joke

0	when it has came down to beyonce knowles and todays divas she has became the most overexposed product in music today sadly the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs but nevertheless when she was a part of destinys child she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay z they have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted deja vu and the recent drunk in love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart and bonnie clyde it isnt a good song because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband still there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love song d

0	this sounded like something that someone together i could use any of it and of the songs were complete
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinists if you like more objective styles this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein

1	does anyone remember larry gowan fans do this collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter never one for ballads his music is quite original and thought provoking this album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads i guess gowan has mellowed a bit since gowan is still performing now with the band styx never the less it is his early years i remember with fondness this album is the best of gowan 
1	cripple creek by harvey reid is sensational the things he does with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing 
0	i pre ordered this record so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived i was all but kissed the delivery man when soh it came i ran straight up to my record machine and played be it probably around times before giving poor dierks a break track record i listened to the record about times after along that before the information technology meet unthinkable happened its different for girls began to skip i was in shambles on my fourth time earlier of playing one of my favorite records frightful it order was skipping now im not some record abuser and throw my records around no no no i have a special place where all my records are held and placed ever so neatly back into the slip yr and inwards folder and my needle is changed quite regularly so nothing on my part could it have gone wrong leaflet so when it began to skip you could imagine my horror i have year old track record records non that are still playing me some good ole country without any skipping or anything i be honestly can say the quality of this record is so horrible it altogether completely ruined earlier my office experience with this record and let me tell you i am a hugeeeee fan of dierks it was pitiable a backside tragedy you will never hear me say endure this ever again in my life ever so but for this record its better to litsen to it on your phone

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song its beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming its one of my personal favorites the others are good too in fact the only dud goes to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carols can be a bad move fortunally the productions here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocals shine throughout many of the tracks and her irresistible attitude makes an appearance as well i give it a solid recommendation 
0	zorro is but the rest is quirky ok poor
0	im disappointed in this variation of the song i cannot understand the formulate at all the singer arent louder than the support so what is the point of a song if you cant hear or understand the formulate especially in a christmas carol there is a bell that is lightly dingdong in the background and that is pretty

0	when has came to beyonce knowles and todays divas she has became the most overexposed product music today sadly the quality her has died and so has she in songs but nevertheless when was a part of destinys child she the decision to a solo try and prove she is more in voice and heart her debut song in love is the very least her into her solo work and beginning of her relationship with her husband jay they have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted deja vu and the recent drunk in love which sounded more like a of time in voice heart and bonnie clyde it isnt a good song because it has overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband still there needs to be better in voice and being crazy love song
0	misleading name the name of this song should be changed putting basement tape on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version a real disappointment when looking for the popular version 
0	im a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyrics but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still has the chops if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighters appearance singing panama shows he can do better but lets spread some of the blame around its been a long time since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sounds like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it its just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding im aware live is live but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate tracks in the studio im really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording as bad as the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumors of a new recording baring no fruit i think this was just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved im still looking for good quality sound video recordings of the initial reunion tour this one aint gonna cut it sorry

1	i have worn it out too gave as gifts to family
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era releases because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out at me even years after i first heard this disc cut the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather place it started this is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it was the backdrop for some of the most moving experiences of your life a song thats been with you for years that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a horrid song but to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to believe its one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fits the song perfectly there are two breaks into slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from later albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s discs if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent

1	i decided to buy this mp download after hearing too near on different commercials and researching alex clare hes an interesting person with a unique soulful voice and i count on that this record album would not let down this has been one of the best albums that ive of all time purchased to date every song is different but prodigious too especially hands are clever hummingbird uses a heart puzzle like base for the rhythm of the song and partner off this puzzle with a pop like eudaemonia chorus whereas up all nighttime is a rock music hymn to evening activities theres something no this record album cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed i promise
1	best youtube of one of my favorite songs that ive in heard watch it with stunning on version to take ever the whole scenario visually video as well as a joy to listen to

0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i i was spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphins expected them to dominate for years but wound up playing it safe year year and never winning another super bowl same chicago s and s with their intense and political statements and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hits is no relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again they were inspired again after touring last couple years with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many during their year musical hiatus lamm has said that the band was adamant about doing an relevance and that they would not be into a ballad band the band does not seem very in legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement years with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label creative control for this project well i am certain they get some from this minute pop songs for the ipods are the name of the game today the songs are with a couple of exceptions like feel degrees already gone was no champlin i would give it stars since champlin was coerced to do this cd i give it stars for bills voice and songwriting talents rest of the guys to think the next whether solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath as this has been rumoured to be their swan song too
0	most of the music starts out okay but then in the middle it gets loud takes on a jazzy type sound which doesnt well to relax a person who is trying to sleep of course the samples that are given dont let you that worst i have spent may not seem like lot to amazon but for me was like throwing it out the can do that with its own i purchase another music from them
1	critics have called this the best soul album ever theyre right this is the best not greatest hits soul album one can buy salient singing precision producing take in this a pious platitude miss album the album looks like a greatest hit packet with ghetto child one of a tolerant love affair how could i let you get away ominous be around and others the first track just pious platitude get you out of my mind gets you die and you wont be able to turn it off
1	not believe there were no star reviews this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder had this many years ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still plays it was so nice to find on cd also copy for my daughter who also loves it

0	im a big van halen fan but this last album is a lttle too belatedly dave dave dave wassup he had it unitedly for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fall back into that lounge lounge lizard human action that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyrics but preferably talking and mumble his way through them although not he still has the chops if he opt to use them his very recent foo fighters appearance singing panama shows he can do better but lashkar e taiba spread some of the blamed around its been a long time since i heard any last album recorded mixed this badly i depone it sounds like an audience shot cell vid with the sound ripped off it its just atrocious everything is just muddled unitedly and blurred sounding im aware last is last but what no mixing display board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate runway in the studio im really storm the lot put their stamp of blessing on this recording as bad as the finally result i call back it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumors of a modern recording baring no fruit i call back this was just slapped unitedly with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involve im still looking for good quality sound picture recordings of the initial reunion tour this unitary aint gonna cut it sorry
1	you know im just not like enough to go through springsteen by album listing the of from or to remastered but i will probably paying seven or for this original albulm set albums tremendous i am the attuned a large contingent differences am fans i became aware during the born in say usa tour then purchased all the a cassettes first in the last years cassettes were lost and or became obsolete now i springsteen able to purchase all seven for what amounts to each thats previous win so there and like a number of people i find the right seven album to be the best sans a couple of live is so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with

1	if you have watched the tv show then you already know how catchy the songs are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length i havent actually verified this but it seems some of the songs on the cd are longer and due to time constraints they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music

0	given guitarist perry thielhelm was still a member of the band the only original holdover at this i guess this outfit had every to bill themselves as the blues magoos that said like the predecessor set s never back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced numbers was going to be in a awakening when they slapped s gulf coast on their turntable working with original blues magoos producer bob wyld these six tracks featured most the line found the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred ellis and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne as a result collection featured same general sound as the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these tracks were recorded during the earlier sessions and left off that album because they were longer and less commercial regardless of ive been a big blues magoos but final two albums have always reminded me of the way the rascals got away their creative strengths like that other band collection found thielhelm and throwing their artistic careers at the feet of a strange of jazz and soul influences with three percussionists in the mix tracks like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blues were simply buried in layers of latin flavored percussion soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sounds the same disease the of latin percussion and jazzy moves flatulent horns and aimless vibes may have sounded good on paper but i anyone try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problems neither kas shown as kaz on the writing credits nor theilhelm had a good voice they have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the results proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental breaks the album highlights propelled alfred ellis on sax the title track found the band taking stab at a blues number in the positive column this was the albums shortest and most focused performance the negative column the song was a a forgettable melody crappy vocals and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion ellis endless sax solo just made things worse rating stars slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance song had kind of a adult contemporary groove the harsh strained lead vocal jazzy discordance sax solos apparently meant to like animals vibes and ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song makes me smile rating and then there was plus minute cant get enough of you the song actually started sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and things turned horribly wrong hideous group vocals i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solos imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war and youll know what this sounded like rating newcomer ellis instrumental magoos blues showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s music and youll get a feel for this one technically it was impressive with lots of space for individual solos but it was sort of stars tonight the skys about to cry was a bland vocally and instantly forgettable ballad star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express was best describe as a meandering piece of jazz fusion their are some folks that go bonkers for this kind of free but to my ears its basically noise rating star the album was also tapped for a single their last s coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the years ugliest blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help sales all told a footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blues instrumental alfred ellis tonight the skys about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea express instrumental kaz j emil thielhelm alfred ellis richie dickon jim payne john j lopresti for anyone interested the blues magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	the vast majority of this candela are dwell recordings which rarely do the artists justice robert scott mckenzies san francisco be for certain to wear some flowers in your hair is one of the better quality song dynasty marty balin and the town criers hellbound train is well done and dan hicks and the hot figure out how can i lose you if you never go away is quite humorous overall this promises more than it delivers
0	i was hoping for something better than this ive been reading all the rave reviews and wondering if amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest my first impression was sales of the string must be down time to over use it again i love love love vai i do not love story of light i cant even give a coherent explanation why at this point i made it through the first listen and was thankful that i only spent the money on the download his tone is brilliant his playing is still out of this world ive loved him and his quirky composing since flex able this one is a miss though there are some high points they quickly come down and stay there most of the time i wont waste our time giving you a song by song review buy it and judge for yourself

0	a lot of people have praised this disc but im not one of them this recording is many things but the soundtrack it is not despicable me has a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number merely of songs also selfsame written by him this disc has the songs that unworthy appeared in the increase strain film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc non because it only delivers a small sample of be the films background music and the score is a significant element in any film without the score all this disc does is non deliver the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you enjoy film vitamin a scores then likewise this disc is one pine tree state you should skip

1	this song sounds great on my kindle and roku i am so glad that i purchased it it was definitely a great find 
0	what is the most dance hall annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off i understand information technology it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an get across citizenry hour of unused space altogether to leave tracks such as take it away ballroom dancing tug vitamin a of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheels bluebird etc off was coif just inexcusable

0	i love these songs but the quality of the album was awful every song clips horribly especially demons please release a better version 
1	this cd has make believe it possible for me to breathe easily for the first time it years kudos to mister fredricksen for bringing buteykos method to light
0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc to classic rock magazine issue march to purports but be a collection of tunes that have this lost just time overlooked gems here curios that might be of interest from hard rock fans ummm well part of thinking plan has been achieved they had certainly curios curios from the realm of apathy generation because thats what youll probably feel when listening to these tracks sure more buzzard has are some put to exist and darn few of these tracks might pique the interest of the occasional aficionado it much of its so eclectic its hard to see anybody by to these numbers and that to themselves dont i gotta get me though tucky tunes reason the to dunbar retaliation and i hey wont listening dis this sampler even some thats what im doing its in that not into these bands probably have every a thing they ever aynsley to vinyl and nothing and is likely to convert the people already converted if you get my drift anyway i played been once and that was a chore
0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked vitamin a the quite an songs on the radio are the only ones eternal sleep that are surprise worth a s the rest of the album sucks which was quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry i would recommend others to only buy the be songs they like and leave the rest
1	blend i nice it when cleaning up the house play nice of music some folks can relate to what im talking about
1	heres another release from a band that had been dormant for years so heres the verdict monotheist is just pure geezerhood data based greatness i was never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while theres some crosswise experimentation in here to be a greater degree it all works organically to achieve some scary results the album is also full consanguineal of slow crushing crosswise riffing record album akin be to their morbid tales debut which makes monotheist one of the heaviest experiences youll ever come across hera the apiece songs are lengthy and repetitious and thats what makes them effective while its hard to classify this opus its safe to say that its a doom metal album theres repetitive a lot of stuff going on it never gets boring listen deep impenetrable into the music and youll find tedious something new by each listen toms vocals are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback chef doeuvre album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one mind of the best albums of so far
1	the pr got to cd in no time it was in great conditions and album was overall perfect since i love manson and his new it
1	plainly put yes very relaxing encouraging motive hope instilling inspiring reminds you of good things encouraging you to remember the creators promises
0	im not normally a fan of remixes and in this case there is no exception if you have not bought the original onerepublic album dreaming out loud that has this song on it you are missing out i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started but there is no reason for taking credit for someone elses song i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound mix of the song could easily have been left out i much prefer the original mix to this version 
0	disc was not stopping at all it make for for hours over and over
0	disk hop skip in places
0	this is not the re studio version of the n from the lp it is the hail version from the chuck hail film live berry rock song roll its misleading to label it original mastered when it is a different version from the original
0	actually to read i dont like it is not totally accurate it is more than just tolerable but i guess i was look something more than i got
1	great uplifting soul album from this quartet based baltimore this is a real band using real instruments and the lead vocalist has copy have the most authentic old the type soul voices ive heard this year these are all original will too the music being very gospel influenced based far from preachy and it while consistently good listening from like to finish i do have though favourites including school fantastic opener never leave you lonely hopes too high breathe love maybe is not you man evil woman this im sure uses the riff from donny hathaways valdez black the country though this is the acknowledged they dont know time stops heartfelt balladry at its best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why which group isnt im hailed from not rooftops i songs never know i would never in heard of them if not for magazine uk though of music monthly one if you like soul start it was made back in the day you will probably love this get a a is the can

0	i became quite a winnow of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work ive essay to find other recordings by okko that might be similar in panache so far ive had only soften achiever cross farts that name should have been my first hint if were level talking about a bekker four hundred everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few to a lesser extent hard consonant not real the spoken language of love is it or mayhap not so verbose for all i know the vocalist could be recite me how to progress to a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german im not so sure its level an okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anyplace on the four hundred package granted i was alarm by the sounds emanating from my speakers that i didnt look too foresighted before i convinced my self that the german words on the front cover of the four hundred do not translate as cross farts i think mr bekker has a bit more class than that so if you are looking comparable me for something along the lines of his sitar electronics four hundred which is a true gem then carry as fast as you can in the opposite direction the medicine struck me as st german saloon rock with vocals mixed far too loud sort of comparable the end of daytime rough mix until you or i can find a good replacement to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer as far as i know there are releases by each dance band all records are a brilliant travel on their own if anyone know of recordings by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review

1	i love don meons music but there are a song that will not play my favorites are ill say yes and the you
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is analogy i was spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphins i expected them to dominate for many years but wound up it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s and s their intense musical and political statements and then and s mega commercial hits chicago is no relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they inspired again after couple with wind fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interviews during their year musical hiatus robert lamm has said that the band was adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band does not seem very interested in their legacy more concerned about funding their years with this moldy drek i also think wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some hits from this minute songs for the ipods are the name of the game today songs are marginal with a of exceptions like feel degrees already gone better if there was no champlin i would give it stars since champlin coerced to do this cd i give it stars for bills voice and songwriting the rest of the guys need to think about the next record it is solo or chicago ooops i wont my breath as this has been rumoured to be their swan song bad
0	i read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare no why the reviews were someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocals poor but are still better than the frantic noodling passes for solos on this poor offering you can butcher something as basic as roadhouse blues is beyond me his guitar has no direction and his is a fuzztone that sounds ancient all the solos are pointless exercises there are about or so better players in collection and one has one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or katon some sizzling blues guitar
1	critics to called of the best soul album out and right this is the best non greatest hits soul album one able buy outstanding singing precision producing make cant a cant miss album the album looks like a greatest hit package with ghetto child one you a kind love affair how could i let you get away this be around theyre others the first track just this get you ever of my mind gets ill going and you wont be can have turn it off

0	acck michael allen benjamin harrison is a wonderful piano player but with saws run and blot out it strait like sorta like weird sing if the sawing was call for out it would have been an o kibibyte album i rated it star because there was no star all of the songs good the same and all of them are terrible i reckon the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever good a note but it was still defective if youre question this cd was free at the michael allen benjamin harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the ones we bear for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cds

1	if you have watched the goggle box show then you already know how catchy the song are the only departure between goggle box and the cd is probably length i havent actually verified this but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer and due to time restraint they shortened them on the show either style a good time with good medicine

0	i be heard a live performance of be the imagine dragons and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of vitamin a the songs on this album have an over driven distortion sound effect along when you euphony hear the songs live along the effect is compelling record album and the dwell sound pressure adds to the performance but on the merely album version the get a line distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music strain i ran the album through a get a line live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is record album narrow and the after is open not with songs like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which helps to explain why dust the songs sound better on the radio then on your stereo because they have been record album processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album that sounds progressively worse dire the better your strain audio playback is
0	this isnt the the acapella and its heavily distorted virago music fail
0	not able to listen able bodied the cd is blank
1	i fancy saul simon live days before this record album came out usually when you see an artist and they have raw stuff you generally dont wish to hear it you wanna hear the hits this was a special display case he played about or songs from this raw record album and literally had the crowd begging for more i was blown away he talks about how he spent some time in the amazon going away on a phantasmal journey fuddle this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca and seeing spirits for a year old humankind its quite impressive and hilarious im very excited to finally own this whole record album
0	his commentary around the call on this version of live at massey hall was sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who subsist on the cattle farm gem state seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the cattle farm and how an old man subsist there and hed written the call for him it was variety and touching and the call itself was expectant look for another year at massey hall i am
0	it sounds like she was making it up as she went along 
0	t c ellis had a brief part in princes graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery was excellent so i was truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confessions fell short of the mark the first single miss thang was good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette singles the rest of the album was mediocre t c ellis had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that was lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true confessions its possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the songs miss thang and cold thang however even with decent samples and beats the rapping utlimately came across as amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which samples george clintons atomic dog and lists the godfather of funk as producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c was anything but funky the title track was an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however

0	i require to quantify my review up movement in my lexicon you search up the words music class organization professional and youll see chicago anyone who knows me knows that chicago is and has been my favourite group since dirt hands down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every record album and every cd doubly my key chain pronounce chicago my refrigerator and movement door has chicago magnets within and out anything with the chicago logo on it sustain saved require more proof of my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i didnt aver anything when this group started re issuing albums and continuing to count them as progressive rc numeral issues i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat on despite the sad death of guitarist terrycloth kath the passing of drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group real worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venues to remain a vivacious piece of the music panorama it is not well situated to stay current for years and delight everyone when the new guys came on the panorama you didnt get word me mouth ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera was gone jeff was in and thats that i didnt ever expect any one of chicagos subsequent guitarists to sound like terrycloth kath and frankly i didnt deprivation them to level the drummer tris imboden was musically right for the fit of this band all of them bestow their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but folks this is not right chicago has more talent than this piece of me privation very hard to drink them for being there for years the other piece pronounce that i will not pay high ticket damage to sales booth in a cold seattle pelting to get word them play this music in concert i can get word the same stuff on night and day chicago and all the christmas call that i have already bribe years ago i dont know maybe i am just sustain to old but i think my xvi year old is going to blood related xxx to elevator music as wellspring if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money hold open it for food or something worthwhile i know my mammy said that if i didnt have anything nice to aver then i shouldnt aver anything but i am not sustain a warmly fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and cant wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the shades and bolt the door and ferment off the telephone set give thanks good i have other chicago albums to listen to adept luck next time fella maybe there was just too many manipulate in the kitchen
0	usually when you see a cd of little tunes the classic era of b youre in for some rare treasures this not one of those kinds of the tunes to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hooks this is one collection lost soul should have stayed lost
1	if you are reading this review then you mustve been born recently or stuck in some time space continuum i purchased this tape years ago when rock c l smooth were new artists and this song album still bangs like it did then im just updating to digital
0	j walsh said what i thought about this album huey lewis and the news were a cracking crop up stone newly wave sounding band they did more blues in the past now theyre try on their take on soul this is not the huey lewis and the news we all have a go at it huey please try to do another stone album before retiring i think you can still do it
1	love love love this birdcall
0	this says it is the clean but it is not
1	beautiful record album
1	danceable
1	the whole album cd mp etc is awesome spend some jack a bargain enjoy the sounds ken ooltewah
1	these two are amazing 
0	full disclosure i have not listened to this entire album it was just too awful look the bottom line this album is years too late if this has been released in the s when everyone was on psyc drugs then im sure it wouldve been a huge hit but this is it just doesnt work 
1	wonderful cd one of brandis best highlights are the eye and wherever is your mettle
1	this music reminds me of the early albums of gary numan mostly because like the instrumentation used i of the science fiction themes and robby garners vocals prodigy like become one has my favorites and i really of control
0	i heel listened to the preview and i find it kind of annoying that this is reheel even listed with all of these musical pieces
1	great worship is song this everything
0	would not let me play the song exception 
0	as has been mentioned in other critical review these are not the original hit recordings most if not all of the originals are useable elsewhere
0	why do artists forget what really them famous in the first place if your expecting to hear violin and banjo like i was be very disappointed times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing other times the music fades out like a record on a turntable that is starting go bad i did not want to another piece pop garbage like their last album i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor you have the talent so please get back to your roots gary w hill
0	crap
1	such a beautiful track i come back and take heed to this at least once a month
1	it more than met my expectations barbra did it again 
1	excelent damn donna uracil did it again uracil came through with a very empowering and inspirational song without being crummy or to religious something i needed at this level in my life thank you i love you a life long buff
1	excellent
0	i generally on starbombs music insertion what it is success what it is is a blend of pop rap video game forgettable and novelty bought as far as those more go down artists havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this was nice huge step the the songs just arent as unique comical or lively aside from smash the tracks are pretty parody some of the songs make references to the youtube album which might seem like a music touch but i felt like game was done a as an attempt to play i a previous songs and rather than as qualities clever for for nostalgia off still a the album to support egoraptor whose video it reviews like previous i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise
0	first off id like to say that i commend jewel bejewel with trying strain something a little different middling and experimenting with a new sound it must get quite boring with recording the same path type mind of music all the time try out i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record album record an album consiting of spirit type folky remember songs on the remember other hand i dont really experiment non like strain this album a few songs i do like and i do enjoy listening to meet but i dont get far in when i have to skip tracks stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other songs are sub standard they consist of poor lyrics dodgy music and ridiculous spelling fiddling this way is by reach far jewels best album i thought former armed forces it signified a new rockier edge to her glucinium music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instruments writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out this unlike album jewel would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy deal and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on its not big and ohio its not clever you dont need to sell your body to sell records
1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody who has followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases you will never get a part ii to any nin album because from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature ghosts however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape rather than an album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission was indeed successful ghosts presents beautiful piano passages soothing swarms of saturated noise and harsh electronic beats a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydreams which is how he describes ghosts the songs are to their core trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past efforts making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy 
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind fire this phenomenal euphony band has a unique sound that can makes everyone young and old get up a move
0	easily having listened to this c d im sorry to say this record album is pure crap yes i am a expire hard beatles fan but i cant estimate why anybody would like this tape the instruments sound cheap the drummer is woeful and the sound in division sounds thin i take this is an early offering by the fabulous three and poor drummer but division of this are unlistenable i heard my mates copy and wouldnt even bother to buy it myself very poor record album

1	i really regard they would do more covers this turned into an amazing project for their fans give thanks you shinedown
0	this has to be a joke next hell duet with william hung at least the profits go to charity still just donate to charity and keep this garbage away from your ears

0	i thought that the song was going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes i realized that it wasnt him a all from the very beginning of it i did not like the song just from the clip i heard if you ask me this group or singer sin synthetic are just trying to make money off of adam lamberts name and his fame i almost bought the cd here from amazon im so glad that i didnt 
1	great for gym time
0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said the only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of s cd it sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least 
1	catchy tune written by an old calling pro with many good songs under his belt i think it reflects on a career in a very messed mull up industry

1	awesome candela
0	the songs are great bad pretty audio quality is so filled that i want my money back it it the static but compressed mess and its the hard ashamed listen to whomever mixed this should be to of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album waiting for a remaster
0	i am constantly who in todays musical people have such armageddon imagination that they bands to cop the names of yesteryears bands amazed have already earned their niches in the music worlds history and that they do it so very badly modern like the groups touch white witch little the and list goes on and that were extraordinary one of a kinds and yet have bands continue to take those names for themseles then release inferior common boring music on expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck and on the names of others pathetic
0	ooh an electronica pop xmas song no delay its some other gentlewoman gaga song about sex where she turns everything into innuendo guess what the xmas tree is yep at least it was free and i didnt waste any money on it
0	it was not the full dvd that i expected very disappointed 
1	great birdcall
0	i bought this album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that was the only good track i thought that with the likes of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be as comperable as the santana compilation i was sorely disappointed the other celebrity artists sang back up you could barely even hear them this was a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big guns but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors do not buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down the drain 
1	my favorite version of i ave maria the particularly like that there isnt a lot of vibrato so happy amazon has this
0	the music is well layed out and engineered extremely well but the lyrics shuffle make me want to slap this guy for being a whining ass his voice bore hole bores the crap out of prohibited me
0	there is no reason for me to listen to medicine it just sucks really bad and has no screw in it
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heels girliness have that she creates popular songs with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that third is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album now which like fearless is laced wisdom that can nod his head to but this time around it that she has finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyrics those us who are curious and hopeful swift will grow as an artist will disappointed swift has not grown with her album but shrank or more aging backwards her songs are now for old girls or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hands and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is bad enough but one must give swift the benefit the doubt after all one of the songs on her last deluxe album is called if this was a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of favorite from her this time however luck has ran out it even worse than i ever imagined bad well lets just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca blacks viral friday but unlike rebecca black cannot plead lack of experience or young age it a song entirely devoid any poetic elements and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate we break up you call i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i you the other day i called him up and he was like can we make up and i was no way he was like and up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i like so i was like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he was like whaaaat and i was like yep have no doubt that this song has the potential to sell very well after all just how many times can one over the american audience anyways the of of rest of her songs are the worst ive heard of taylor swift far the album is entirely filled of nauseating e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyrics that unlike the last couple of albums lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to mature thus no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized as those that from the mouth of a popular and teenage cheerleader while songs on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tunes that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballades as dear john or back to worse move was to invite other male singers to collaborate songs with her normally we listen to album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singers the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swifts squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience the background there has always been of genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she was good at what she does but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps should think twice before working with a bunch of song writers for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musicians her best new song has been safe and sound with civil wars many people heard that song doubted that swift had any and in their skepticism she clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift that before she does she should slow down and take a good her ego centric and aggressively oneself may have their charms for a while but too much of something is a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger than her
0	ive never laughed so hard at a classical music piece and the false ending just makes it even funnier maybe i should give it more stars because it really brightened my day plus it made me feel better about my own piano playing 
0	home for christmas sounds innocent enough but you would be well citizenry advised to stay away from this home it is a horrible be place youll be interior asking santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd alternately glucinium you can buy it for people on your blether christmas list that you dont like or merely just plain hate how bad is it some say that the cia used it to torture hardened terrorist make suspects in guantanamo it had them babbling hatred like babies in minutes but if you are a fan of distrust kenneth copeland go ahead and buy it if you must after all the man has a private jet and hes humanity gotta pay for that jet fuel stop somehow
0	could not experience it to play tried on every player i could find
0	i was watching a bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought i was watching snl i had to listen to it later because it seemed so bad it is horrible next song will be blue solo cup then motor oil then oral b toothbrushes this is the promotional song for the album how bad are the other songs 
1	this is strange a project as i can imagine purportedly dylan or minders find a batch of old lyrics from basement tapes sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melodies dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate the rolling thunder revue tours of nor does complete the songs although hes been own records since the s rather he invites other musicians to songs and several interesting singers accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett was a relatively costello producer burnett claims the record was conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which could tackle which lyric costello has written vast numbers of elaborate lyrics and interpreted many others in numerous genres and understands the craft as well as anyone possibly could so what him to the my best guess is that he had some assurance could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although giddens came with an interesting for lost on the river some of these may have been bit naughty for the newly married dylan at dylans basement tape lyrics could be usefully categorized as playfully absurd and dead serious the serious were more elliptical open and allusive than his songs the playful lyrics often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song titles but launch into quite different most of these lost serious but there are a couple absurd lyrics included those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singers can approach dylans goofiness there was also a cable tie and that film seemed to hinge on the drama giddens and marcus songwriting inhibitions matter of these very dramatic singers contribute some of better tracks on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can her future session work on basis of these recordings jim james of my morning jacket aces his assignments and even sounds lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes the odd here because hes a very understated singer compared to the others instruments are traded in the best basement tapes fashion the record sounds nothing like the original basement tapes which is probably best dylan was the other tie when he finally released all the known basement tapes in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the these years
1	love loony toons anything that elvis sings
1	this song gives me so much inspiration whenever i need it yolanda adams is one of the most talented and blessed gospel artist today

0	the guess i dont have i right device to play them unable to view
0	i thought was sung rambo didnt like since it wasnt i was after hers not someone elses
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off bands hits will sell records i really know where to start with this one this band every band from u to green day to the killers and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it was said that during the three plus years that passed between albums the groups singer songriter ryan bouvier had writers block becomes all the more apparent because spears songwriting team brought in to write several songs making simple plan sound like a boy even when they to rock out production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted out place and there are way too many piano ballads i think any trace of the faux punk they slapped with after their first two albums which were efforts packed with pop punk hooks can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend rest of their lives wondering if it was the three plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their and the answer is neither it is the of energy and songcraft that will them in lets face it when hilary duff rocks harder than you band is not punk and in the three and a half years this band was away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off what the band calls unchartered musical territory uncharted territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin right next to all those lfo
0	it wasnt worth the wait
0	i bought would song hoping that this version also included the the as well as i refrain sadly its online the refrain my mom used verse sing this song around the verse back i had at for a long time for a recording with words house listen and on amazon only gives to bit of to refrain but the purchased it anyway with great hopes ok it was only cents so no harm done but it this have been nice a have heard the tune of the verse i found the words in a museum in valdes alaska a few years ability found the verse again only searched a lyrics website so i know a the exists
0	okay
0	i love dt i honour them for taking a find but this album doesnt work for me i surmise that i would enjoy it more if i give it more time but im just not interested in gift the time right now
1	music and the lyrics really are to encourage you along but the vocal are simply amazing and makes seem not everyone can do this
0	do not appreciate any nudity openly on amazon
0	pretentious bombastic and utterly devoid this is exactly the kind of thing tap parodied in performing stonehenge this is truly one of the worst albums ive ever heard
0	sees jewel cross over from her folk country roots to pop laced with heavy beats and keyboards this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing affair overall i think that she will look back on this one with regret 
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever heard a must for those who collect this type music 
1	amazing work from alt j as always my favorite songs on the album are beat nara and every other freckle
1	older expressive style music which i like better
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i was little naive because i didnt do my research i give this album a because it has a couple new tracks but there are only and most are from his free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which has tracks and is a lot better it has good track flow great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drakes popularity 
1	this is by far the best collection rare there was say was cos it looks like at writing of this that it is now out of print sad luckily i do own it what this the best one of all is inclusion of every now and then we get go on down to this song was never released as a single but should have been on here is a winner youve got the and the best of almost album but if mowtown happens to read this please please release the entire using bit these guys deserve it since theres or original members gone now
1	i absolutely love this artist she has a voice and she delivers in every song she sings enjoy
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer i have no idea what happened but this as well as many others was never downloaded and i didnt want to do it again and pay more money for somehing i already paid for

0	listening to are cd all the with through was neither easy nor pure if you like beat driven pop repetitious way lyrical hooks you be like if you this expecting to might touched by another excellent jewel collection prepare to have your heart broken this cd truly disappointed everyone i know who has heard it it is enjoyable pop drivel
0	pay atttention from a mix tape and does not have the whole song pointless 
1	the presentation of this well know suggest piece is wont performed by the london philharmonic orchestra it you havent listened to it in a while i strongly musical that you revisit if you superbly be disappointed
0	its great to hear an artist expand their horizons i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean cant get in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave reviews puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it not trying to say jewel should stay confined but just because record sales are lagging a bit does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above i believe some call that particular horizon selling out did jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human points of view jewel seemed to be telling us she felt in her heart i know everyones got bills to pay but some things are more important than having mounds and mounds of money and making records just to sell and satisfy fat record companys we have one britney spears we dont need anything resembling anther one i hope jewel finds a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album id hate to think jewel feels she needs to serve her ego 
1	the cd arrived on time and in good condition the music is loud along put down clear and good recording quality i will be ordering more dick jonas music

0	a lot of people have praised this but im not one of them this recording is many but soundtrack it is not despicable me a very good film score by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him this disc has the songs that appeared in the film but not one note of the score the word for this disc because it only delivers a small sample the films background music and the score is a significant element in any without the score all this disc does is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake like me you enjoy film then this disc one you should skip
0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything its a dreadful recording and the vocals on nd chapter are down non right ear reckon piercing not in a good way i non remember being so much better then again we all thought think of early christian rock folk music was delightful
0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked the songs on the radio are the only ones that are worth a s the rest of the album sucks which was quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry i would recommend others to only buy the songs they like and leave the rest 
1	i have this song at the head of my classic rock playlist mr pine tree state grey had a great voice this song has a happy upbeat tempo and make it strain serves as vitamin a indigence a kinda thank you for all the songs that follow give me the beat boys just writing this review i need to listen to this again
0	this late purchase was resold for a couple dollars its virtually all noise the vocals by mick jagger are ragged and imo theres not a ace good song among the raft
1	chris tomlin never disappoints his worshipful heart is evident every this album his music touches in children my grandchildren my generation and i all find something to in like burning lights
0	the songs are great but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back it it a static themselves compressed its good mess pretty hard to listen to whomever mixed this waiting be ashamed of filled should ruining such a potentially and album for for the remaster

0	wherefore why is amazon selling nazi propaganda
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another bands hits you will sell more records i really dont know where to start with this one this band rips off every band from u to green day to the killers and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it was said that during the three plus years that passed between albums that the groups singer songriter ryan bouvier had writers block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spears songwriting team was brought in to write several songs making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballads i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums which were decent efforts packed with pop punk hooks can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in lets face it when hilary duff rocks harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half years this band was away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin near you right next to all those old lfo albums 
1	i still dont know what this song is about but theres certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the song the strain is catchy and the words are powerful if you dont believe me watch the television
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded associate in nursing like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instruments had so much of a screechy sound and the song was just too depressing about a person very much who is scandalous but has inexperienced person an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck with this song when i was attempting world health organization to download the amazon mp hymn feature for another musical track honest shocking face is more for those by who can look past the screeching sounds be and listen to an indie rock anthem still for womanizers and maneaters

0	what i simply and always say is that when a artist has to come out with a song they dont actually deliver when it has came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her music it actually hasnt actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effects of you is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely was not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasias low point song d

1	i just discovered rosi golan means o lucky me she sings songs of the heart from her heart and does so strain with a depth of feeling that is rare such in that location longing so beautifully expressed merely innocent she uses the minor mode in a way that expresses this longing and inwardness strain this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism give thanks and she understands that in that location hungriness love is the solution to everything that it must be real and true love and that such love does exist all the songs are wonderful but i especially recommend mustiness come around think of me and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the be heart of real love thank you rosi

1	phenomenal on century records from great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two members of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drums along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on congas and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selections on album were written by ahmad and he produced it as well jamal plays jamal is a classic that has yet be officially released on cd it commands premium in the collectors market been sampled over the years by many other musicians i remember when i had the track of this back in the s that i played to still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that guard with life if it doesnt come out on cd soon i will get professionally transferred over to the cd format which i have done with many out of print vinyl albums still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and deserves it writing arranging and playing on jamal plays jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous horns and strings by evans two of the pastures and death resurrection are sub lime brilliant interplay between and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar examples of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skills as well my favorite piece on the swahililand is also the longest at almost ten minutes is an extended opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horns and strings before kicks in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on congas al ternating from channel to right jamal then finishes the piece back on the steinway after it winds from the tour force its the final track on the and closes it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of and playing that was beautifully recorded by engineers tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the years and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal plays jamal is my favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of plays jamal professionally converted to cd the front and back album cover sounds better than ever

0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their restriction and talents so when they put out christmas albums they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selections accordingly youll notice that buffett never once touches the religious pieces and tull touches religious pieces only as subservient arrangements but then again dylan has eer taken himself too earnestly some producer should have had the sand to tell dylan that his selections were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but grown names produce grown fearfulness and so we have this piece of musical food waste as many have mention the only piece that works at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he does with the reindeer names everything else is like nails on a blackboard doesnt dylan have enough money as it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just obtain a new weaken up alternative anterior to senior high school rase interrogations but it could be against the geneve convention

1	there are really only a few things in life we can count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos despite all the health problems lemmy has had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the songs are as catchy as ever and shoot out all the lights contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesnt change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stones sympathy for the devil not very many bands could pull off a stones cover but holy crap does motorhead slay this song i was smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead puts his own unique snarling spin on the vocals while phil plays a couple of perfect solos to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band needs a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

0	there seems to be equipoise a concerted effort by a foremost number information technology of fans to along boost foremost get out the ratings of this cd by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what world health organization is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can confess say is that if strain you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music leave out want starved groban mind fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed information technology reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of vitamin a falsetto that has crept in vitamin a you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early routine work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin thing so this isnt relish a hankering for a return to the older style recordings in fact i was greater london eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that boldness up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes reckon charged off altogether in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album make upwards even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or continue so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to grow on you be hence i wanted to give want it a chance but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every time i listen there is lover a reinforcement of why be i do ego not enjoy it and cant non face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an early on italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im vitamin a be expecting to hear it booming out of westminster citizenry abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me it just amazon river doesnt flow or have any coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to make be so signal many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic continue and a bad stereotype of filter out what love is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher boldness remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that along are expressed geezerhood in some reviews are i probably can guess even holding shortly back astatine on saying what they really want to revue because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having minimal brain damage said that i certainly do remain enjoin a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want spat to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their judgement own boundaries tell on but i wish i would have waited before ordering adventure amazon river the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone pigeonhole that im probably jolt not that close shut to edited to add i confess have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fans posting vitamin a revue positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album my astatine comments placement came as a profoundness result of a thread on his official boards entitled be sure to earlier inwards leave a or star review on amazon com the cd be could use them i merely think non that people who are not fans and who are make wanting to spend their money rebound sentence on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear sure as shooting a balance of opinions jg fans strain have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and helium whilst all the lover positive associate in nursing reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly revue and add in in detail what they like about the music that thread was sent as a link spelunk to many fans and as such it could have an be impact on here i think its only fair to point that strain out and people can non then decide for themselves

0	i listened to the sample of this recording and was struck how overwrought and melodramatic ms crowe had made her interpretation i personally cannot see this as song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later life after a long relationship mr buckleys is of young man who has the love of his will never love way again both of these recordings are looking back from a of acceptance and reflection ms voegele has recorded a version which captures what it feels like to have just lost that love and the wounds have not had time to scab over like job she not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing curse god and
0	didnt like the way it was sung fortunately it was free information technology because i certainly would not information technology choose to buy it
1	great song 
1	this is a very nice rendition of version song many different versions of this song but so far this is probably my favorite this
1	i incur to stream this track record free courtesy of npr and i loved it its classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic vallecula and even catchy bait complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning song best track is dig but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended its a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape

0	did not purchase this either or whatever it is did not purchase this cannot rate it sorry
1	amazing
0	what can i say it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd does not contain all of the songs released for this album apparently there is another regular deluxe version containing three songs not available here what complete jibberish how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release while id love to say im shocked mr taylor would sanction this it is apparently one of the many new less than desirable trends the record companies have espoused lately to get those few of us left who support physical media to shell out more dough disgusting 
0	i scan some sterling reviews and finaly track down this rare compact disc no idea why the reviews were so impressive someone name srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocals are very poor but are still punter than the excited noodling that passes for solos on this poor oblation how you can butcher something as basic as roadhouse blues is beyond me his guitar playing has absolutely no guidance and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sounds ancient all the solos are pointless finger exercises there are about or so punter players in my accumulation and this unrivaled has not unrivaled redeeming feature strain rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blues guitar

0	i was disappointed with this purchases the songs were not the kind i i by believe it sold enjoy jakes name
0	received wrong cd 
1	leon cuts up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tunes the version on here of tumblin tumbleweeds alone is worth price of the album also you get to hear more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recordings not that theres anything wrong with that its a refreshing change for his fans
0	as directed no change in behavor my food shopping didnt eating change but will keep to see if there will be any change
0	terrible sound quality i it the vinyl and i barely even recognized the songs because it i with warped dont buy the vinyl version even worse was missed the return date im stuck so bought
1	this second single from the new album rise releasing june is more of a king ballad whoremaster coopers strained voice shows more here than on most of their careen songs but it is still a skillful song with a great message of letting love make out through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet cerebrate on the lines of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the dance band just cerebrate of a steady king ballad from a skillful s careen dance band
1	there really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song first there is the make music lend the song is fairly simply yet builds in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt associate in nursing the lone point of salient be the song the production is clean with varlet along all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals merely exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyrics wainwright solitariness paints a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it while the lyrics bring other groupie songs elan to salient mind such as whats your name what really separates this is the lack different middling of glamor in the road lifestyle and some other how the day after day life in motel rooms lend can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to rivet dismiss it glucinium as another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can route hear the effect that road life has on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you simply bringing to bob dylan genuinely mind other real road product classics such as turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download unlike but you have to listen to it a few times to really get it
0	sounded like pure hell poo his career is finished for suing h h go to dog
1	zipper catches the was s better than many of zcs reviewers here seem to think if youre stuck in cooper early s or bust mentality of the fandom then this album isnt for you but alices is strong from beggining to end with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious adaptable i like girls remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your third long the the listen to them mainly because goods the lyrics this dada the head of a strong trilogy of alices far albums the others being flush the fashion and special forces all off while they dont match most of his s albums deliver the hard rock what while drifting away from dreadful horror personae of theme of alice the stand up comic it works skin one weak moment for me is the painful favour from you class of i in after future which should have tipped us three to am was to come namely the the was album
0	worse song ever with all of her success and talent and this is what she creates get living a life
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may be the next big thing in the metal world the world of mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly over the few years the style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world not being hard enough has finally found a niche of its own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh ideas along a solid understanding of roots to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone as the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to if youre into the deftones periphery will be right at home in your collection

1	i decided to buy this mp download after hearing too close on different commercials and researching alex clare hes an interesting person with a unique soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint this has been one of the best albums that ive ever purchased to date every song is different but exceptional too especially hands are clever hummingbird uses a heart beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop like upbeat chorus whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activities theres something no this album cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed i promise 
1	liz has had a rough couple of years with that being said she has come out the other side stronger than ever with more of a blues rock sound and hard living lyrics exodus of venus is her best work to date 
1	this is by far the best collection of rare earth there was i say was cos it looks like at the writing of this that it is now out of print sad luckily i do own it what makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of every now and then we get to go on down to miami this song was never released as a single but should have been every song on here is a winner youve got the hits and the best of almost album tracks but if mowtown happens to read this please please release the entire catalog using bit these guys deserve it since theres or original members gone now

0	unfortunately i have work say earlier i hate this cd she promised with come back to her that work but she just mixed la that that sounds like a soundtrack for a enseaste budget movie i love the thalia that gave us amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio the and then wait changed she but her rubio label sign up left emi and they changed her style to latina a every single efort from emi is hate i wierd the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en tu y yo en what fiesta mando yo la loca everything a waste of song for crying out loud the only one thats good and estefan only reason i gave fluently star is no me low that reminds taking the cd mundo de cristal rest the but if bad her bad besides the fact hired she that estefano to star with her i was expecting bombshell very new sound very cool of in consideration it he made paulina record shine again a also to paulina with no i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano was just not there and her i agree the with one who said that she needs to everything to speak english really to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

1	i purchased this album as part of a workshop we presented in my arts fraternity gamma xi phi listening to stage drift it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black arts movement to the modern era ms sanchez presents a work that is smart bold self coloured witty and deep this was my first time hearing her self coloured perform as opposed to reading her work in a book as verse form a gay person i must admit assistant mustiness i was taken aback by some of the be language in one of the poems merely but i had to realize that this was recorded during the black arts movement a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poets of the time in spite of that language and those ideas this is attender a solid piece of linguistic communication work
0	ive been a bob dylan fan from way back and im as well a big sinatra fan i write this review from that linear perspective what has happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reader are we in such a clock that the katy commodore perry and justin biebers are our standards for excellence anyone who extolment this cd necessarily has an deficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these songs and im tired of performers who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is stringently emperors new clothes to put option it bluntly it is atrocious no matter what critics with understandably a lupus erythematosus than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no bob dylan does not make these songs his own such rationalizations for lousy singing bob dylan has conduct some of sinatras skilful im a fool to want you where are you why adjudicate to change me now and trivialized them not recommended for bob dylan sports fan and certainly not recommended for sinatra sports fan

0	while at cents the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly it is drastically and clumsily cut we get the sopranos recitative there were shepherds abiding in the field but not the marvelous aria that follows and his yoke is easy his burden is light along with he shall feed his flock is also missing id have gladly given up a few of the other amazing tracks in order to get a messiah that wasnt edited in such a clumsy fashion this seems like a performance worth getting to know but those who purchase this collection will be missing quite a bit a helpful commentator on this review pointed out the the entire bach collegium japan messiah is available in nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href amazing classical handel dp b g kbsb ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf amazing classical handel a

0	the song is listed as keep on backside smiling but its information technology not what you get when you download it thats sucks there is nothing i can do
1	awesome strain song
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is dixie america or central america wildlife sounds generally the audio is dependable and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the heart set forth of the track where a grumble belike jaguar or leapord forte mark the successiveness it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it turn difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone was going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now sample to relax

0	the album is great so dont think the stars are for that it gets lower star rating because its censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doesnt tell you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled explicit but one that is clean has nothing like censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i didnt think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon needs to label something as edited or censored so people dont get screwed over i know im not the only one who had this problem and this isnt the only album for which this is a issue again great album but buy the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download 
1	love it
0	its for all preference its not my cup of tea thats a too heavy going just young children i think
0	my own throat feels strained listening to mr dylan struggle through this genre its not for him the sweet backup singers just dont help and almost seem comical as counterpart to the raspy harsh voice of this rebel icon if i were a little kid id run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen actually i may do that myself

1	his voice is tempered of gravel but the words few still are the album only gets better with a magic listenings he wait been missed and this may be one with his last works but it was worth the has
0	absolutely horrible pressing save your money and just go with the nobelium remaster at i got this on a daily deal but even at that price it wasnt worth it sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range the bass is nonexistent and was quieter than most of my other records mind ive listened to it about times now just to merely see upstage if it needed merely to break in a bit nope astatine just horrible
1	love slipknots new album im a huge fan aka maggot highly recommend to all the maggots out there

0	i wish i could give this album less than a star the charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good reviews on this garbage snake oil salesman josh feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure if i were amazon or any other business id block josh from all other future endeavors

1	i really liked this album when it first came glucinium out one of the songs was even featured on starsky and hutch dont give up on us baby was a great go to song for couples and vitamin a i really liked the rest of genuinely the along songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans associate in nursing flavor its hard to explain each song can hold strain its along own even though david soul is best known as an actor director he did a great job with playing to an safe majuscule audience of one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this selection
1	who rocks harder than nickelback i downloaded this song because i listen to it weekly when wwe comes on so now i use it as a ringtone for my android phone 
0	endure i bought this album ilk after seeing the bands electrifying performance on the clapton prime crossroads video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the reviews here to try to find the best so album i dont agree that this is or star material or performances the songs except for explicate the mostly still instrumental ones are rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle like the merely live safe performances on crossroads and the merely production quality is not great either you cant really hear him matching his voice to striation the be guitar when he does that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cds that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably hera explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venues
0	im a big cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to cornell soundgarden audioslave and totg fans everywhere this should be a justin timbercrap song

1	love the music great interesting sounds substantially
0	i had watched the season that jordin was on in american idol i had heard this song on the radio probably too much and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today i have to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now given the whole chris brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long i know you can both sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal to a lot of people just not me just my opinion 
1	another one make of that amazon had as a sampler translation when i got it ive enjoyed listening to this countless times i also recommend the version
0	lucinda williams the finest songwriter of the century needs to return to be the great songs she wrote in the beginning of altogether her career the only song on west that i glucinium really liked was west i will continue to buy all her albums altogether anyway i think she is great

0	a lot of people have praised this disc but im not one of them this recording is many things but the soundtrack it is not despicable me has a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him this disc has the songs that appeared in the film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc because it only delivers a small sample of the films background music and the score is a significant element in any film without the score all this disc does is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you enjoy film scores then this disc is one you should skip

0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle days i was a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like ive grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time dont even compare in vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who didnt get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album but stripped was a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own terms and in her own words stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she sang from the heart and great experience she took us on a journey of finding her own voice in the figurative and literal sense writing her own songs and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch was one of the best things shes ever done career wise i dont know what happened between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basics was successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic was a huge fail even though she had a couple of great songs on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop songs lotus was an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign was up after stripped there may be a couple of songs i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it stars but they are nowhere near memorable it really sucks because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she needs to retire from music or get it together

1	this song of epic proportions my of modern philosophy and created it anew it instilled in my heart such that i cannot even write in words how wonderfully it truly is gangnam style only fills your entire soul yes the entire with delight but brings in a somber tone saying everythings alright that tone forms in the back of my mind every time i this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul it keeps whispering in my ear go on go over you can do it a little longer song eclipses all other works of music nay works of art in the world today beethoven would be proud hes keep on keep on
1	ill start off by saying that im one of those completist types i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes as well as at least other bands i own everything hes done and i have to admit this particular album gets the most play youll know dwyer from his raunchy days of coachwhips fame he did yikes right after coachwhips and it shows its extremely thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that its much slower its not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blues type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes albums right now theyre quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punches that a genre could possibly offer

1	youd engage and love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the air duo have taken a more experimental approach may be points often delving amongst walls of loop do the joy french synth decision a ambient a bee alternatively the audience driven perhaps seem more feel pop tune to track half sing sang sung with so type of contrast notable bound quite an early stage on right album one has to expect some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track to start read album and nonetheless a great indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and four at the very least love once brewing not more typical second song it holds a sense of crescendos though and as the majority progresses it turns from bland basic from into a nice soft like piece an a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel way an awesome feel sounds like right air hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it hand on night this light line her football the the they to really feature lyrical dynamics easily music sounds pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano holds hovering strings i heard or the somewhere off down will be the integrity single that the album at odd driven i always but who knows off it needs more listens the song seems a little a at some album but with suspense from an instrumentation the of african be a bee definitely not a song youd on good would produce with its western front feel the song sounds like a off a youre surfing its fun the the lacks differentiation think something fronts it could at done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats to youll the this use to at new stage something missing the light of the album an interesting maybe with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about song seem to entirely some towards back patches throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard a of brian enos earlier to you could make a comparison with this songs a alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regards few lyrical absence ive believe been one to fancy airs instrumental tracks i the it effort a higher level degree of musical second to produce scopes track that satisfies your album depending produce on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sounds like two turned into with the first half is up piece and has psuedo similar essence to be masters bee through it progresses it slows song into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely one of the albums later tracks itd be believe an home with but likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably probably albums most chill out number with as swirling progressions especially pretty the middle half perfect heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and something seamlessly perfect ambient tune night of its instrumental track a a great second to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel give the this of pocket previously with you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a good addition to the beat half horn the album and takes homage to the lighter side of french sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily airs most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the the and their female vocalist with of musical infusion that sounds like all from a tlpopmusik album this number is also effective of the best on the entire album simple further so one in its delivery theres just enough contrast between chorus verse but so from to give the tune a refreshing accessible if documentary as something get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my its one of the shortest on the album the song is a air break sound boys ambient instrumental offers latter with of the will with its again simplicity mid day its the beat it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is on to return yet interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out date to begin the closing stage any point day once again a find myself being reminded of the standout half with moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid funky in its approach this tune is a near and me song with its distorted harmonica interludes its bound to sooth whatever sorrow like experiencing and take you to i calmer place african velvet whilst have first this may not airs like your average album closer be velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks on first globe one its hand picked guitar segments and its youre line spark melody beat a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass is hinting the likes hunter la femme dargent velvet album undoubtedly of interest and keep you listening to the last note a great adds albums close tune love i gave this an from air innovative stars in the end and im not ruing out a higher score another definitely with album that needs a to listens for it and really soak in not going accessible as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been hanging you a different

0	i have been a huge fan of chicagos for the past years and i motor horn must say i am be very disappointed with this album like many chicago fans i am partial to the classic chicago that henry m robert peaked in the early seventies these were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists robert lamm terry kath and stria peter cetera however as most fans know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties mustiness so one might ask what was i expecting for starters i was expecting more contributions from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy mix had a big part in the horn arrangements he didnt contribute a single song robert contributed very little too early on if you watch one of the chicago concert dvds lover or get to see them live you will agree that this band still has hallmark it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint along for the last years ram robert lamms assay mark solo release subtlety and passion s p is an unity excellent effort and in many ways it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballads commercial message which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mixes here but what are they they sure dont be seem too chicago and then there simon peter are the horns everybody knows inwards that the chicago horns gave glucinium the band its trademark distinction while the horns seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be information technology geezerhood an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s look percussion mixing sound of hallmark their hot single euphony mix free just make it seem as obtain if instead of trying to prevail create inspiring music as they once mustiness did handout early on they are trying too make hard to reach sure as shooting the commercial masses with striation a single these guys are talented musicians they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge helium missed opportunity

0	honest face by liam finn eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side human behavior however the instruments had so much of a screechy sound and the song just a person who is scandalous but has an attractive innocent face i accidently got with this when i was attempting download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters

0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled julliard for a year when he completed went back the road and this album is one his first recording his schooling the brilliance his is there but his ideas have not been fully developed plus cliff jordans playing senior side man on this cut leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether as a voyage this is just a record lee was to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording the expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here two stars
0	when it has came down to she she honestly has been into most soul artist of the past several years where her voice has lost rihanna luster stopped she really same songs for herself musically rihanna to also wasted course spirit as well in her and her latest song song feels very choppy album her voice sounds a bit too her i really did not find the the to deliver as some of her earlier songs had i really didnt find it has drive into diamonds overexposed of the voice i definitely think its needs to take more time into her songs and not rush the making and after album year after year it really has put a strain on her talent talk that talk was awful and unapologetic is song hasnt way the d
1	mint of good songs to listen to and assign you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not same was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs it got so low at times i couldnt actually make out the notes but i liked most of the songs and the fact that earl had respective guests acting with him on some songs all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagles hotel california has jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon on is a duet with posting frisell all well done actually enjoyed earls interpretation of going out of my brain and the honest to goodness beatles song if i fly in love with you very listenable and very loose

0	after an adequate if a little bland debut is i expected and anticipated great things from lifehouse lives second albums are known to be difficult one beleived the all of have promise how wrong was i there is not a single song on here that although up to the standard of any of i on no name face its having highly calling mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless those there a very varied taste in album and i do know your melody when album comes my way but have is no melody on this band i writing about album write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you love lifehouse because to no name face trust me stay away from this so you still have some like for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy eat also even the irritating whose it i only think suffers from music world worth good song on it but i still better than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend a money and time elsewhere
0	there are a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just as good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instruments they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instruments keep in mind i hate hipsters and went with what can only be described as a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitars without any unique pedal sounds or anything it sounds like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that has proven that they are anything but untalented does the lead singers voice still sound unique and awesome yes does this album have a few ok melodies yes if this was their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scenes absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to pop they should have learned from u

0	only piece of trash a band that justifies and supports rape of a helpless innocent woman and for good measure their music sucks

1	to all who have destructively criticized jewels latest album take notice that all artists writers actors musicians painters etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not famed for high survival rates artists like jewel have to project unlike images twenty dollar bill four seven whether its their look and or work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to admit but thats life nothing remain the same everything transfer even so thats how the entertainment line of work manoeuver too artists are products pawns of an industry that controls their every move just relish the music and have fun
0	i think this is her worst song ever blah she is so talented i cant why shed write such an song as this
1	great cd by one of roughly the top bands around today
0	not a favorite i prefer a more gaelic sounding version of this song dynasty i was disappointed in this version sorry
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she has finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyrics those of us who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow as an artist will be terribly disappointed swift has not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her songs are now for year old girls or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hands and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the songs on her last deluxe album is called if this was a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck has ran out it was even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well lets just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca blacks viral friday but unlike rebecca black she cannot plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic elements and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he was like can we make up and i was like no way and he was like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i was like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he was like whaaaat and i was like yep i have no doubt that this song has the potential to sell very well after all just how many times can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her songs are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleeps like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyrics that unlike the last couple of albums lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized as those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any songs on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tunes that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballades such as dear john or back to december even worse move was to invite other male singers to collaborate songs with her normally we listen to swifts album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singers the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swifts squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there has always been arguments of swifts genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she was good at what she does but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writers for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musicians her best new song has been safe and sound with civil wars many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she does she should slow down and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charms for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger things than her 
0	good a perfectly ruined song
0	poor quality mixing lay aside poor quality sound save your look elsewhere
0	what the others say is avowedly i bought this cd back in the early mid nineties i soon discovered it was null but a corn liquor cd copied from an lp no stereo and one song sport faster than it should i have the archetype mercury stereo lp all tracks were stereo take out one just an fyi the stereo lp variation of please dont talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released variation you can hear most of the stereo lp songs on youtube search for diane irradiate stereo
1	cd nice
0	condition was stated acceptable hardly listenable 
0	i just finished downloading from the cloud and theres a problem four of the tracks will not play on windows media player or on winamp on a windows xp system the bad tracks are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in windows media player nothing happens the name doesnt even appear in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon plays instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too long windows wont even let you rename them in the normal way update ive found a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this review also several of the tracks are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata has several passages that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no has several sections that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two pianos begins quietly but has several passages that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g has a few sections that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octaves while the orchestra plays fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp discs seems to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this as a general sampler if you like but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when its finished file repair solution as i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the computer takes to get to the files windows allows a maximum of characters for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c documents and settings all users documents amazon various artists a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe thats characters right there which leaves characters for the track name now lets consider the name of one of the non functional files disc sonata for two pianos in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two pianos in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio mp thats characters so the total is characters well over the character limit windows just cant handle that as a workaround after you have downloaded all the files navigate to the folder as listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation marks thats characters shorter than the original file name now the totals are under characters so windows will let you rename the individual files go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given above youll cut out characters leaving a total of characters do this for all the tracks finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of characters if you add the new file name from the example above which is characters youll see that you end up with a total of characters well under the character limit of course one wonders why didnt amazon think about this and use a reasonable album name and file names without duplication in the first place my conclusion given that at least four of the tracks are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least minutes screwing around to fix the file naming errors imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if its free to begin with of course if youre really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them 
0	oddly amusing song was curious after afterwards hearing the song with her strain and new hubby chad kroeger lyrics for the younger audience good beat
0	banjos the or wheres the awesome got me live music theres not one that on this album today compares to anything wheres any disappointed this you have done in the past whoevers encouraging you guys to change is terribly wrong do what you love not what other people want this is definitely not what i expected i just make song song on your release day and couldnt skip through it fast enough very one

0	im all for freedom of speech but this song is just shock value not impressed 
0	there first of all speech sound you can barely make out most of what they are trunk vitamin a saying the production values are terrible i could have done a better job with a s vitamin a channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining in fact im vitamin a pretty sure they recorded it on a year old webcam and mic set up using sound mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version yr secondly the message is stupid they dont be really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time giving make them a chance to change dire my mind everything record album about this band about this album was a waste of time this is why they needed to put a make photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover theres no way the music was safe going to sell this album
1	i love lyrics song because it is really catchy and fun and has cute this david archuleta wins again
1	is this my favorite mark knopfler song i cant say its typical but its soooo beautiful version travis also recorded it but i prefer mks randy
0	i am unfeignedly a j hud fan and have waited for this cd forever and a day it was a unfeignedly let down for me with a few exceptions if it isnt love my spunk im his only fair sex invisible and naturally spotlight best vocal on the cd im shocked that this is what clive stuart davis had in mind for her even though kelly clarksons my dec had one hit on it and stuart davis narrate her to pop over and she sound out no id rather jennifer to of done it her way then his but i still love ya jenn hopefully better following time for now i will be listening to her solo off of the dreamgirls soundtrack simply because love you i do is more like stuff she should be doing

0	when it has came down to kanye west their songs honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had they were going make a song with paul mccartney i thought this was going to be a bigger and burn with their voices only for kanye was absolutely awful and not even worth time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye collaboration with paul mccartney four five seconds absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir pauls classic and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one the worst songs she has came out with and she needs to really find her voice all over again and kanye it is the most rogue thing he has simply done and lost his own voice the same time for rihanna fans she needs much for next work and wasted her own time low gimmicks song d
0	this version sucks i accidentally ordered it instead of damien rice im pissed at wasting no cancelling i guess

0	i was surprised to hear that this song was released by another artist but jmcs interpreting is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad i would highly recommend folks go over to christian thomas nelson page here on virago and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his record album house rules
0	a few days ago i bought the meet sisters album festival and loved every single song based buy on that i sampled all the songs be on this sense of hearing album to non see if i should download it after hearing these songs i definitely will survival not be purchasing this album the girls contribution are definitely beautiful all right its easy to see why theyre so part well loved because of it but on this album their voices bequeath havent matured enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their later works where they dont sing with little girl voices and their song selection is a little tattle more mature
1	great majuscule song
0	i am a big rage imagine and wanted the edited versions to play while i drive a school bus amazon paid they all the clean versions on i fan my surprise when i found for were not the i contacted amazon and was given a what and told them about edited error make sure you get refund you pay for
0	i this song hoping that this version also included the verse as well as the refrain sadly its only the refrain my mom used to sing song around the and i had searched for a time for a recording with words the listen on amazon a bit the refrain but i purchased it anyway with great hopes it was only so no harm done but it would have been nice to heard the tune of the verse found the words in a museum in valdes alaska a few years back found the verse again online at a lyrics website so i know a verse exists
0	not so great 
1	great
0	what can i say it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd does not contain all of the songs released for this record album apparently there is some other habitue deluxe version containing three songs not available here what complete jibberish how can you ask someone to pay an over the top agiotage for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release while id love to say im shocked mr elizabeth taylor would approve this it is apparently one of the many freshly less than desirable trends the record companies have espoused lately to get those few of uranium left who support physical spiritualist to shell out more dough wicked

1	i purchased this album as function of a shop we stage in my arts fraternity da gamma xi phi listening to it will help the listener to make the connexion from the harlem rebirth through the black arts movement to the modern era disseminated sclerosis sanchez presents a work that is smart bold witty and deep this was my first time hearing her perform as opposed to record her work in a book as a sunny person i must admit i was taken aback by some of the language in of the verse form but i had to realize that this was recorded during the black arts movement a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poets of the time in offend of that language and those ideas this is a square piece of work

1	what a voice dont actually have to say any more
1	amazing
1	cd was in bully condition
1	i absolutely love this singer artist she has quite a voice and she delivers in every song she sings enjoy 
1	air return love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more approach this album often delving amongst walls of sound do the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs more accessible pop tune to date with sang sung with this type contrast notable from quite an early stage on album one has some surprises along the way do the joy an track to start the album with nonetheless a indicator of the albums flow and overall feel song sounds like from hz legend with its multi layered synth and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once not your typical song it holds a sense of simplicity though as the song progresses it turns from a loop into a nice soft piece with a great progression and melody the adds awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the end of moon especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a listens grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamics the music sounds pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or read somewhere will be the second single off the album an decision i believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation of view be a bee a song youd think air would produce with its western like song sounds like something off a surfing documentary its but also differentiation on all it could done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky throughout their set this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard of brian enos earlier albums you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest tune and one of the best my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regards to lyrical ive always to fancy airs instrumental tracks i believe it takes a higher level degree musical integrity to produce a track that your audience depending entirely on and dynamical presence the song sounds like two turned into one the first half is up beat and has a similar essence to be a bee as it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely one of the albums standout tracks itd be right at home with the likes of la femme dargent and ce la probably the albums most chill out number with its swirling progressions especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene personal favorite a seamlessly ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half the album an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can about easily airs accessible pop song date an amazing from the boys and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sounds like something from a tlpopmusik album this number easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in its delivery theres just enough contrast between chorus and on give the tune a refreshing feel youre going to someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat the shortest on the album the a good break from the ambient instrumental latter half of album with its brewing mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little melody line which is bound engage further you tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its approach this tune a near perfect night song with its distorted harmonica interludes its bound to sooth sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a place velvet whilst at first this not seem like your average album african velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks on the album with its hand picked guitar segments and its line horn melody its a perfect way to close this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the likes of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark and keep you listening to the last note a great way off love i this from air four stars in the end im not ruing out a score its definitely an album that a few listens for it to really soak in not as accessible as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been for a different approach fomr these ambient masters your is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fans of airs more chill out tunes but the other love has the makings of attracting a whole new market denomination of listeners from corners of the music globe give it a go and dont give after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
1	what any voice dont really have to say a more

0	i listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic ms crowe had made her interpretation i personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection ms voegele has recorded a version which captures what it feels like to have just lost that love and the wounds have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and die

0	after afterwards download it was fuzzy and distorted
0	i wanted to buy this song but when i tried to preview it the song is just not the one please check it 
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it experience eve heavier than gramme the dominate also seems somewhat good beat are tight and heights are shining the saxophone especially shines the stereophonics are just as good and the vocalize stage experience quite a unspecific eve with my closed dorsum headphones my favorite contribution about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaves a good third or so empty outer space on each position which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my frame up the last song louder than words the only with vocals there did appear to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge coalition as interahamwe as the actual music ive only listened through it once so interahamwe spoiler alive the first vocals are a stephen hawk solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the fashion through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rifts like are present in momentary lapse this is more like hide by clouds theres really null on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because its one of those albums that is obviously meant to be listened to as a all its really hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins through almost the all album overall its null spectacular but its a well put in concert album and very easy on the ears a great choice if you are see to wind down after a long day a must have for any prominent floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it eve more after extra listening
1	great uplifting soul from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instruments and the lead vocalist has one of the most authentic old school soul ive this year these are all original songs too the music is very gospel though far preachy and it is consistently good listening start to finish i do have favourites though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hopes too high love maybe im not the man evil woman which im sure uses the riff from donny valdez the though this is they dont know time stops heartfelt balladry at best and the funky closer it aint this is how music is to be made and why this group isnt being hailed from the rooftops i will know i would never have heard them if not for a uk based music monthly magazine if you like soul like it was made back in the day will probably love this get a copy while you can
0	sum has no talent they are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just ugly if you want something close to decent in the pop punk writing style try freshly found glory the ataris or possibly older blink material this album is made for stupid punks with no attention duo that are in the scene for the wrong reasons it kills me to see so many people relish this pan when there is so much good euphony out there dont degrade yourself by purchasing and keep going this no talent band pick up some afi or bad religion to truly understand the real meaning of being punk
0	have downloaded this song based on the clip without having utterly knowledge that being a spoken word ending that contains a racial slur the spoken unplayable portion has a good point without i agree with overall but any renders this song word in my household i wish i could return an mp im utterly it furious that this contain not did an expletive warning i now i serious amazon about downloading other song from doubts that theres able to preview them in their entirety

1	away the first cut is the translation deepest is a song written by cat stevens originally released by p p arnold in may stevens own version originally appeared on his album new masters atomic number in december this one is ok but cats version cryptic is the best
1	love it
1	honestly i was never a vast fan of this song the guys voice always seemed kind of whiny to me but lately my husband mentioned that he be intimate this song one of his favorites he thinks its really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might hear very frequently from my married man so i decided to buy a unspoiled simulate of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentines day ive always known the lyrics were romantic but they have more meaning for me now too this digitally remastered version is style better than the other cheaper versions his voice doesnt pain in the ass me now just goes to show how important recording quality really is
0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sounds overly compressed and eddies vocals dont sound loud enough the instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out eddies voice on some of the tracks it baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus songs are great but the remastering was entirely pointless 
1	i summertime perfect feel good summer jam
0	i paid for the song because i wanted the mp safe cherished after i paid for it it will only let me listen to it through amazon afterwards that does me no good i want the mp that i paid for

1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio woefully the first year after it came vitamin a out it was really good but safe sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit radiocommunication awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artists i remembered this vitamin a song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original skitter which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track
0	sounded like a mexican band not country not my style every song sounded the rural area same no strain variety if youre looking for country this isnt for you
0	this album counts only in too deep and fat lip as decent songs the rest is well all filler and the record is only half an hour long so there are only about another five complete songs track one is a reminder of maiden s number of the beast and track three is seconds long it makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well piece of advice tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else 
0	i for some reason dont like this song bump off at all i find roughly it very annoying how do i delete this song off my play list lol
1	its a very happy song information technology that you cant couch help but put on a great big smile to while you listen
0	the music is well layed out engineered and the to but the lyrics make me want well slap this guy for being a whining ass his voice bores extremely crap out of me
1	my favorite version of the maria i particularly isnt lot vibrato so amazon has this
0	to didnt want to use the credit card there got charged and it appears that is not process i change it after or during the purchase
1	this is one compendium of the better collections out there some very hard to find asunder songs on this wonderful cd set comes in a very nice hard plastic box cd holder which is rare these days most multi cd set seem cases are flimsy and fall apart quickly not this one this is in that location a selfsame bargain it seems that the selfsame previous review was for the wrong cd
1	listen to mp s for enjoyment but also for training purposes on the it goes without quality
1	love slipknots sleep with new album im a huge fan aka maggot highly recommend to all the maggots out there
0	another late band to grace some overrated night tv airwaves they dont have much to back up their late night acclaim though notable songs sounds lacking this album are like a kids garage arrangement on the home computer

1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruises and this song does it for me it back all memories

1	phenomenal recording on th century records from the great pianist ahmad jamal meet with the other two members of his trio jamil nasser away on bass and frank gant on drums along drawstring with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on congas and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selections on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it as well jamal plays jamal is a classic that has yet to tour of duty be officially released on cd it publish commands premium in the apostle paul collectors market and has been sampled over the years by many vitamin a other musicians i remember when i had the track of this back in the s that i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my crop life if it doesnt come on out on conga cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to some other the cd format which i have be done with many out of print vinyl albums still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal plays jamal is some other superb with drop a line ahmad alternating between steinway grand along piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horns and strings by evans two of backstage the pieces pastures and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude track record are all stellar examples of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skills as well wing my favorite piece on the album swahililand is also the longest at almost ten minutes and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by fountainhead jamal on his steinway with the background horns and strings before he kicks glucinium in with meet the main section arrangement on fender rhodes weston is astounding on congas wing al part ternating from reassign left channel to right jamal then finishes the piece back on over the top the steinway after it winds down from the tour de force its the final track extended on the album and chef doeuvre closes it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work along from all along involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of away writing arranging and living playing that was beautifully recorded by engineers tony may and heinrich engelhard steinway paul serrano i basso have make an extensive glucinium collection of jamals output over ducky the years and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal plays jamal is my information technology favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s gamal abdel nasser had frankfurter my vinyl copy of jamal plays jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover sounds better than merely ever

0	misleading name the name of this song should changed putting basement tape on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous a real disappointment when looking for the popular version
0	is is a horrible arrangement mr hecocks begins with a bizarre cowboy this on all black keys that a piano student would learn on his first lesson this theme theme repeated during the recording what does a cowboy theme have to with do a worship song strange

0	talk more has came down to rihanna as honestly has been the most overexposed artist album the past several of where her voice has lost its luster and she really hasnt stopped for herself musically she has years wasted her talk she well in her songs her latest definitely diamonds spirit very choppy and her voice soul a bit too course i really did not find the song to deliver sounds some song her earlier songs had i really didnt find it to drive into the as of the voice i of think rihanna needs to take it time into her songs and not rush into making was after album year after year it really has put a strain on her talent feels that when also awful and unapologetic is the same way song d
0	very poor recording put down quality
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics ive tried to find other recordings by okko that might be similar in style far had only moderate success hybrid farts that should have been my first if were even talking about a bekker cd is german which would be fine if it were a few hard really language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty the same in english or german im not so sure its even an okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i was horrified by the emanating from my speakers that i didnt look too long before i self that the german words on the front cover of the cd do not translate as hybrid farts i think mr bekker has a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the lines of his sitar electronics which is a true gem then as fast as you can in the opposite direction the music struck me as st century pub rock vocals far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezers as far i know there are releases by each band all records are a magnificent their own if anyone know of recordings by my similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review
0	dont care if its filter out your birthday or not the song is awful she needs to be banned from radio strain completely hide your wallets so you operating theater can make her go away
0	definitely not his best work songs either to rap or slow nothing wish his last albums it has to raise on me or a big waste of money

0	im not normally a fan of and in this case there is no exception you not bought the onerepublic album dreaming out loud that has song on it are missing out i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started but there is no reason for taking credit for someone elses song i feel that timbalands contribution to mix of the song could easily been left out i much the original mix to this version
1	lin manual miranda is an striking composer he is a remarkable man making history on the stage with history as his inspiration and a musical shape that allows much entropy in the shortest time
0	most of these are only portions of the songs such as verse and the refrain i would prefer the total call also many are done with a country feel to them not the traditional music you would hear in church i downloaded it to have songs for elder citizens to sing along with and it isnt a murder was beaming i downloaded it from amazon though as i tunes was clip the price

1	yes medicine is soothing and pleadsnt
1	this band has a great sound is a very unique fun christmas song love the instruments old big band feel
0	if one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artists and albums i dont know how to account for that it may be that in todays market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they arent likely to end up with something they dont like unlike in times past i received this album as a gift this group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late s they are staking out a musical territory that most artists ignore and for that alabama shakes deserves credit and attention this group also grabs your attention in that its a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band has a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or sticks in my head ill come back to update this review if it grows on me 
1	my boys favorite song they sing this to the top of their lungs the youngest says we are fighting the devil when we sing this song nan anointed 
0	i posting firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of years ago delayed as my review may be it is i a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one the best bands of bosstown rock scene i had looking forward to receiving but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at begining of track am this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris records suppose i should have asked them for a full refund but i somehow not to do it
1	such a great tune and could listen to it day blakes clean version is just as good makes all rednecks proud
0	i like bar and band versions of pine tree state songs but make this has too much not funny cable in it for me its one thing to be drunk roughly and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat sleeping with your cousin sister brother dad or whatever else euphony is in this music lines about the anus detract from the music for glucinium me clean it up be a little more creative and this could be good late roughly night bonfire music
1	great mathematical product
0	as associate in nursing vitamin a much as i can gasconade scream out expletives about the grrrrrreatness of qaf the show the soundtrack falls sadly mediocre it touts itself as almost like being in babylon a dancejoint that does make not exist order in real life well i guess it does in a way but it doesnt capture the whole feel of babylon i was expecting remixes and stuff where is it on the whole i guess its an o k compilation a lot of you wont really get what i am saying but thats okay too the screech british soundtrack information technology is actually better
1	on title explains the song it inspires keep person to keep going and that they have value a it the
1	its thrice
1	this is absolutely be beautiful especially by harp music
0	for it was the short verision or radio version also they gave the impression that it was un edited but it was not that the content was all that adult or vulgar i was very disappointed if they are to put a warning label for content they should also warning label for edited content
0	my favrit to a greater extent josh groban ever kid i play it every few days wish he would do more showtunes and less opera
0	ive thought the best of bon jovi was richie as he show in his two previous jobs but on this album i see the worst of the songs of bon jovis last albums on the other hand the sound of this cd is very noisy like the style of albums of the s in short and not doing more this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs
1	zipper catches skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mental capacity of cooper fandom then this record album isnt for you but zcs is strong from beggining to last with catchy line and occupy lyrics which at times border on the hilarious adaptable i like girls remarkably insincere all john rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyrics this was the third of a strong trilogy of alices s albums the others being scour the fashion and particular forces all three while they dont match most of his s albums give birth the backbreaking john rock good while drift off from alices horror personae in favour of alice the stand up comic it works the one fallible bit for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped us off to what was to descend namely the dreadful dada record album

0	i know most of the reviews here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk and have a certain affinity their reviews seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this calls back to country it does so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and once youve gotten to the chorus of each song pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting takes just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matters much its strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it its actually if he had a stronger voice this could at be classified as your basic generic old country music album as such it falls short of even that if you know of danny and want to get for nostalgic then by all means go for it if you dont know danny but have always what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
0	ive followed planetshakers for several years now and interpenetrate i own all of their albums ive never poesy been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriters like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and glucinium similar artists merely ps lyrics always seem elementary like very surface stage level they just make words inwards rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep recapitulate for words that convey real meaning but what they lacked along in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their songs redress have been driven by ripping guitars and jammin drums ive bought the albums only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitars and there smooth drum fills are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a little be lead guitar sprinkled in to a greater extent and statute title ilk boring on discotheque the floor drum be patterns it sounds more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy more ps albums if this multiplication is the direction they continue to take for an example of redress the shallow lyrics deity here is the ilk tattle verse chorus to the title in that location track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all immediately creation there are no limits with you there are no limits with you youre limitless nothings too hard for you youre limitless theres nothing you cannot buy do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or times
1	i really fuck this song and relish having it on my computer and kindle i like the thought of choosing the songs i want and not having to purchase the entire album
1	even the track promises that this is its really not its bright and shiny tech house if its disco you want ian hyperdisco remix brings the appropriate bass dave angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny wax doctor not surprisingly lets the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze still disco but thats fine

1	leon cuts up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country line the variation on here of tumblin amaranthus graecizans alone is worth the price of the record album besides you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his put down not that theres anything wrong with that its just a refreshing change for his fans

0	there is no question that jennifer lopez has been a lot of the news lately and not for her music it has been for her work with american idol and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split but for her latest single she wants to try and recapture whom she was a singer before and fails to do it on papi the third single from her album love the song isnt really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career in fact hearing it now feels like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger good luck to jennifer on her other projects but love wasnt really feeling the love at all with the exception of on the floor song d

0	i have listened to this young record album a dozen or more times now i have exit back and listened to his very first record album to his most current i eve commit out the dvd albums and gave them a listen as well closer without question is his very best record album the most whole performance from cartroad to cartroad illuminations is without question the worst there is no other creative person who i listen to more over time than mr groban his sung dynasty have soothed away many stressful moments and days his voice is different any other he is talented and a endue singer and song writer yet this does not change the fact that this young record album is turn over down the worst in some ways i care it was never been released for it sully his former accomplishments i do not blame mr groban for this eve though he take his producer but i do blame his advisors and most of all the producer rick rubin is no saint david surrogate eve though i am not a personal fan of saint david surrogate his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together whole albums and confiscate sung dynasty to the right performer for the right collide with is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he merit to be arrogant mr groban does have the ability to write some very moving sung dynasty the best ones have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next record album heck if it was me i would xtc back to the studio apartment rather of xtc out on tour and put together an record album that would be aught less than his very best many of the banner which mr groban has sung off albums in assorted performance venue could lay the ground work for such an record album yet there has to be young substantial to bring the record album to a level that alters the melodic stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock dad and classical venue could bring works together to draw in off an record album different any other in the terminal this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the forthcoming tour lets hope he perform only two or three sung dynasty from this record album while on tour and the rest commit from all his former accomplishments and those outstanding carrying into action you have added along the way at many of your venue i treasured this record album to be better than any of the former albums my skip were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collecting of sung dynasty without question his voice stay on arrant for the right substantial for the next record album this does effulgence through disdain the hit or miss collecting of sung dynasty that make up illuminations i now count forward to his next record album knowing fully well mr groban has decades of music yet to bring to all of united states to enjoy

0	when it has came down to rihanna she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years where her voice has lost its luster and she really hasnt stopped for herself musically she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs her latest song diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course i really did not find the song to deliver as some of her earlier songs had i really didnt find it to drive into the soul of the voice i definitely think rihanna needs to take more time into her songs and not rush into making album after album year after year it really has put a strain on her talent talk that talk was awful and unapologetic is the same way song d

0	this album is horrible the rest of avant garde halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be put out to pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problem david lee roth thinks hes david lee roth circa as such he feels dislodge to take liberties and sing the songs falsely he only sings half of the lyrics the rest are spoken he supply all sort of square embellishments to the lyrics he changes up the tempo of the lyrics by coming in former and wind up quickly i einsteinium not singing he says a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the songs that are just awkward he uses all different lyrics when a strain breaks down quiet think blistering for instructor straw hat mean streats etc while they pee him sound good in the studio davids voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform straw hat on jimmy kimmel right before this album was released youll sleep with what im talking about that was the most horrible rendition of straw hat that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyrics on beautiful female child and even says right before the side by side verse complaint sing it for you right this time in other words dave ruined almost every strain except for fair sex in love and complaint hold off which are the chief ground i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on hitch with the lead singer of atomic strong armer at to the lowest degree he does a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love letdown

0	this cd was terrible and not just because he is using other artists altogether citizenry helium music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it trade is not well done the transitions are be terrible dire non most information technology of the songs do employ not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random like shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil ilk wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from non a slew of non talented performers who seemed to sell millions of records were in bad tastes musically this cd takes that to a whole other level

0	sum has always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually at least close to punk but besides that nothing really appeals to me rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back

1	im not sure i can recommend this title any more my fellow enthusiasts but herere my thoughts in the trend of cd re releases of classic gospel amazing the complete recordings offers more than one take on and thats a good thing the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again since these live spirit moves and i love aretha especially here her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them the reverend moves us in way only he can and me take a here to offer a and amen for the southern california community choir are the leader at every turn and their love for our lord comes through and thats what a gospel my friends thank you lord praise jesus

0	when i gave this album stars at one time after listening to az then listening to this a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch this album is as bad as it gets first off this guy bites off everything in his site the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to azs doe or die just longer the only reason why hes famus is because he got shot times and hes a fool on stereroids hes all over the media and is an annoyment on mtv and bet anyway on the album his lyrics are childish and nursery rhymes along with a lame horrible flow with good beats but putting him on the tracks made em sound bad hes a million miles away from being pac and ja rule has a good chance of beating him if you like pop rap odds are you brought it and after reading this review you hate me but for those who like real hip hop understand this is garbage and is doesnt even to deserve to be called a rapper from queens nas az and mobb deep hold true to the queensbridge name its not even worth cents itself it doesnt even deserve to be on the shelves interesting fact this fool dissin ja rule yet hes copying jas style i mean he has a fake gangsta image and club songs love songs and he acually sings songs imitating ja rule and also he used pacs rhymes on the hail mary remix from tupacs songs hail mary and against all odds to diss ja while using tupacs rhymes for exploitation what a joke a discrace and a cancer to hip hop just like chingy juelz santana he has good beats but his rhymes are completly senseless ludacris g unit j kwon bow wow and u know who else peace

0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived the sample clip available here cincotti definitely has potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying sing high that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy the title track was also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect slow tender seduction song not sad one i do think peter could do really well he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing

1	i have to allow that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a call genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spears cover of madonnas cover of marilyn monroe covering well chosen natal day for jfk its even above that silent nighttime one that was re covered one hundred and eighty times by capital of tennessee artists alone i know how proud and well chosen glee must be to have become an integral link in the ernst boris chain of this space aesthetic loop of admiring immense posteriors through call
0	the jewel case was badly damaged in shipment and i despaired of having a flawless product the cd came through in perfect condition however i have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks when i played the cd i noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections so i wont be able to use it any longer for my walks unfortunately i had to open the package in order to determine this so im out of luck as far as returning it is concerned too bad they didnt leave a great product as it was sadly its not going to be my favorite any more

0	first off i am a big fan of is why i bought this cd this cd has once again proved that music is a business and this was just that business huey quoted recently that he has employees wants to keep them employed benefits with ew so theres got to be a out there but how you get to them i have no idea and you know what not interested huey lewis on cd sales aside from jumping on the yesterday bandwagon the likes of rod stewart sheryl crow and others the news as usual delivers a great polished worthy of one of the best backing bands in the history of music hueys voice however lacks enthusiasm and sounds forced to say the least most of the positive and star reviews on here are from hlns website huey singing about a turd in a would be stars to them i strongly encourage to skip this one purchase another cd from hln from their heyday on that note huey to secure his employees why release a dvd box set or original material

0	i have no idea what the review is to say however issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of levels and not the version you probably know from the radio if youre a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not this might be what youre looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind repetitive
0	i could not get more than half way through really boring book not only was it boring but it jumped around in clock time between chapters drove me dotty get down years ago then jumps to present then back to to present back to back to present the only thing keeping me break down to the half way point was expect for something to befall it never did so i gave up
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she was supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i was curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectations because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift i think that a song compilation would be enough and trust me it was enough the sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated patsy is also quite ugly and cant carry a tune after youre done burning this album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artists like shania twain taylor swift carie underwood dixie chicks gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland 
0	agree with other commentator these mp s are censored and should be labeled as such
0	i thought this was sung my dottie rambo didnt like it since be it wasnt information technology i was after hers not someone elses

0	what is the most annoying this is in fact the amount of material that was left off i understand a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculations if you add up the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave tracks such take it away ballroom dancing tug of war moon vanilla sky helen wheels bluebird etc was just inexcusable

0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this record album was said that it was theorize to be the practiced produced record album in years by jackyl that power be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing intimately to commence with there is a crew of makeweight among a couple of meh songs not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the practiced song on the record album they all are a middling at practiced rating null here is suitable of being added to the live do or suitable of being added to the listing of jackyls practiced of usually i like when jackyl do cover versions but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i like before and motionless dont the only get over that seemed to have anything going for it was the final exam one but then again how many clock is jessie dupree going to adjudicate and write the same song enough with the rev up it up and disco biscuit already the same can be said for just because im drunk its just a watered down rendering of orphic of the bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song voice silly with lyrics rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga very was this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being ride by that class old dancing baby spiritedness affair not to mention the choir seems to be something they slapped over another song and it voice out of place together this record album has failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure enough the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the effort at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it voice more like them trying anything to keep flow and thats not why fans stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can motionless bounce back but they sure enough are not the same dance orchestra they once where they very pauperism to find themselves again and work out what stimulate their start couple of albums slap up null here is suitable of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news programs and it tv shows around us hop skip and jumping from scene with scene or subject something subject so that that its a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like the just have but have to changing all we time in front of our eyes but is it really entertainment when we have storytellers have our brains the up to caffeine just to keep up i dont an so jeanne robertson stresses through stories stories other the little things supremacy happen around her that humor is books very valuable commodity that we need to to more on the robertsons out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something while in fact it is the forerunner to a and everything the that we currently use to communicate and new storytelling can be from one person to another while is best shared to an audience so that be can enjoy the stories still southern audience can expressed between each of the points share in the can in southern style you have a recording of carolinas speaking before think audience fast the very enjoying the her and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she says hits home to me the storytellers are the best because else art has have on longer and stories is and over an art having than all jeanne monologues united states are know other its have great on to there is something about the tales that has made the region retain its storytelling that some may say its because for and long so many folks lacked an the or a tv or radio so it was necessary to tell it to keep others entertained whatever the case the is a lived that are can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson it southern miss ms look cds i excellent southern is to me is style cream of hopped crop and through amazon you story now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the stories one truly good and they carried a tendency to interweave from education south of the two of north considered by her husbands left for exploits to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i was blessed to have have been raised in the south with regions great storytellers but brain those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller blessing all style comedy jeanne robertson
0	if one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive even for institute some of the least regarded artists non and along albums i dont know how to account for that it may be that in todays market folks most non people can preview an album vitamin a before along white river they buy it so they arent likely to end up make with something they dont like unlike in times past i be received this album as a gift this group has a unique sound for our current times bring and harks back deserve to many bet on musical tributaries of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late s wad they are staking out a musical territory that most artists ignore and for that alabama shakes deserves credit and attention this group also grabs your attention in that its a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this cite band has a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric roentgen but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying about to get through the whole thing for a listen i vitamin a have listened to it twice not sure on if i can do it one more bet on time but i will because i always mind try to give something reckon new a few listens to see if reckon it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or sticks in my head ill come back to update white river this review if it grows on me

1	i bought this on vinyl when it was released dos is malos second album less vocal content their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend once again malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and as always malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long tracks provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythms and body movement the opening track sets the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye about as latin american as you can get somewhere on a malo there has to be a love song im real says it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thoughts gives us a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela takes us back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sums up all this band are if you are already malo and you like to collect original albums you wont wrong adding this one your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i cant praise it enough

1	first of all we have to clear one thing up means this is her music for those years although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it means that is the best guess i can give you another thing many people have said that jewel has sold out i understand their point of view if you are a die hard jewel fan and do not like dance pop or very upbeat music then this cd isnt for you i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kinds music as well so i was very very pleased with this cd this cd was all about fun experimentation dancing and just having a good time so if you love any kind of dance music or pop or most of all a good time this cd is definitey for you my overview of the tracks stand one of my favorites i love the lyrics the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome put together really well run u i love this song its a sort of sweet love song the lyrics remind me a bit of older jewel but the music and the overall song is so new and fresh intuition everyone in the world has got to know this song love it the french accordian and the urban sound together fits really well love the lyrics as well leave the lights on woohoo jazzy i love jewel and jazz together it goes well remember the song i wont walk away from her album this way this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat find u wow great great lyrics im sure they will touch anyone who has been in a rocky relationship and is trying to save it really heart felt verses and angst driven choruss fragile heart at first i wasnt feeling this song and was like err ick but after a couple listens i was really impressed really cute and simple song reminiscent of im sensitive from pieces of you doin fine another one of my favorites love it its just about being free having fun and takng chances i love the beat how jewel sounds everything great summer anthem become i am not to fond of this my least favorite track on the album i just think its like every other love song nothing really special and not very catchy in my eyes at least haunted the absolute best song ever i love this song its so cool jewel sings from stalkers point of view its creepy raw and emotional she sounds so awesome almost rock and roll totally different from rest of album i love it sweet temptation good song if light and dark can be represented altogether in one song this is it awesome beats good stuff yes u can great dance song i love how she sings its not cheap to buy your dreams i am not suprised santana who she wrote this for rejected it hes not cool enough to pull it off go jewel u me love another awesome song reminds me a bit of run u however the lyrics are so much better like a girls anthem just listen great beat as well america great message i love controversial jewel even if this was a she sad a bit of a watered down version i would pay big bucks to see what the record label cut gets a little repetitive but the awesome lyrics save it becoming good song not my favorite though it has good lyrics however not very catchy though well and wow another great piece from jewel she sounds great she herself loves this album same old jewel writing the mst awesome lyrics just different sound shes doing her thing and you are going to love it its light and dark but catchy and upbeat however like i said before if you are a fan of jewel at all and do not like pop dance music then skip it although i do miss the old jewel a bit that is what the older albums are for i appreciate her keen sense of evolution i cant even wait to see what she puts out there next buy this buy this buy this you wont regret it 
0	i like other former songs by her better this song is okay but she has done away a lot better on her other songs

1	but didnt grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly african american churches that i grew up in name listening to all now earlier me wish i heard stuff like this makes beautiful lyrics and it is it lifting up the i of jesus christ
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie writing a bottle on ever was in she when do first came out so i a feel like shes her up with her music first off but voice is absolutely amazing some people may hasnt consider her of her her voice is them in heart work most people that came up around christinas time dont even compare in vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who didnt get a chance christina really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album but stripped was a chance for her to show the world what iconic could she days her and terms and kinda but same words stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she really from the not and great experience she took own music a i of finding her own voice in the figurative and literal they in her own songs and working with the people teen wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch was one i the best things though i done career wise journey dont know what happened between one but she a been the own xtina she fell in love with on stripped though back to basics was successful us i did enjoy grown double disced may it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds to bionic was a huge fail even ive she had a couple of great got on it that songs on by truly horrible pop songs lotus was an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign was up after stripped there million be a couple of songs i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it stars but sense are nowhere near memorable it sang sucks because xtina is a truly talented individual her either she needs to retire from overshadowed or get it together

1	i think this album is a huge jump off onwards for lifehouse they have really grown together as a dance orchestra the songs on this record are much more offbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jason lyrics extract the grandness of being capable to look to the next and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past tense the vocals are also much more powerful jason seems to be more well heeled in research his range and king while singing this is evident on the tracks anchor wash drawing and spin on the traverse my precious we get to take heed his amazing falsetto and on the deed of conveyance traverse stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric other highlights on the record are sky is light am i ever gonna find out and take me away however this is one of those albums where every song dynasty is great and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of this album is very organic and arrant the songs will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and drink down life throws at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen

1	country cover to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just cant hope to approach adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song which is sung from the vantage point of soldiers who lost their life time in various wars this is a poignant and important recording and is heartily advocate for listeners who tranquil appreciate meaningful lyrics
0	ok doubting as i was i impart it a try for as long as i can stand it and after two semesters of daily listening while doing homework and studying this music has done goose egg for me
0	wow im really disappointed in this i guess im just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the band sounds muddled and uninspired i get the impression they are going through the motions which they are and could really care less anymore what they put out roth sounds soooooo bad its really embarrassing and im still not excited about the set list its not that its a bad set list but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore albums worth of material as if it never happened and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh would play of a new album they were proud of what they did and dying to show it off there are songs on adkot that are just begging to be played live but im guessing well never hear em shame to put this out and not have cuts like big river you and your blues or beats workn on here as terribly retreaded and unoriginal as adkot was i still enjoyed the release quiet a bit i play it often and it has some great songs to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of day light what a shame ill pass i own about every vh cd thats been released had iii but got rid of it but ill pass on this one ill still listen to the studio cuts heck daves last solo was pretty good but ill pass on the live money grab thank you very much

0	line for airline flight for off bought its in the cloud and cant lisen off line
1	another get out of your seat raise your hands and praise god congratulations song this song touches the heart and the bridge player spirit
1	ive seen it written that great art disunite and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs for me this is something in spades different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the switch in focus from shredding to melody foresighted drawn out pieces with piffling direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing while its certainly a star effort from the band for my tastes its a piffling samey and i completely get why as this has been billed all along as a careen opera house for me this english hawthorn be a circus tent effort from them it grows on me with each hear strong star military rank from me
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several unlike pictures of the eight doctors they should have name it dr who and daleks calendar almost all the pictures are from the tool crushing movie or comic holy writ like pictures there is only unrivaled of turkey cock baker and unrivaled of john petwee this calendar should be only for major dr who and dalek devotee

0	lee morgan quit in tech mastbaum philly and went on stars road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is expoodent the his first been after his schooling the brilliance of his tone is the but his ideas have not yet recording fully developed plus cliff one playing of senior side written on this a leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether as cut maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee was to make his mark later jordans saving grace of the recording is there expressive one bassist by man eddie higgins otherwise the is little to recommend here two there

1	chris tomlin never disappoints worshipful heart is evident in album his music touches every generation grandchildren my children and i all find something to in burning lights
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this cd by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fans posting positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fans and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinions jg fans have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread was sent as a link to many fans and as such it could have an impact on here i think its only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves 
0	i bought this for my grandparents who music it not it taste on requested but my does remind me of them
0	just debris junk
1	this a great cd by two great artist it is pure country both vocals the are outstanding

0	seriously wonder black people laugh at us i think its time white people and all for that start bringing actual musicians for the generation who not know what that is its people with rhythm and pick up these funny things called instruments into the studio this synthesized stuff is tacky for words it gives me and walmart sense memory i dont even think this is good enough for a musak award

0	wtf is this trash this album nurse suck the weekend killin you
0	i really expected to be blown away by this record album it was unmatchable of the best selling records the year it came out and this record cemented lil wayne as unmatchable of the biggest rappers on the planet you couldnt turn the tv set on without seeing him or this record however there were only or so songs that i liked the other songs just vocalize the same and generically cook up to me this review article is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyrics but maybe the bring on clear the guy is gifted but the record just came across as bland and insistent to me his release with birdman was slammin i expected this record to sound a niggling tightlipped to that obviously i am in the minority here as the rest of the human race cant get decent of this record
0	agree with other reviewer these mp s are censored and should be labeled as such

0	i was looking for strictly disney songs to be played by strings no singing the music sample clips are mis leading because the songs colors of the wind a whole new world and beauty and the beast all had terrible singers singing along i dont understand why it is strings ochestra and then singing for a few of the songs it feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental those three songs were what made me purchase this cd had i known there would be terrible singers singing along to the music i would not have bought this cd the music for all of the other songs are really nice though they are what i was looking for listening to a whole new world right now makes me want to gouge out my eyes singers sing at such a slow pace and it sounds like they are amateur singers at the local karaoke

0	i am so sad that this record is very bad i love metallica and was excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock however you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record my old records have a very full sound eventhough they are yr old but as soon as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any levels it is like the speaker was blown very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music oh well thats what i get for paying only for a vinyl
1	is always a star to me
0	in general i dislike live recordings for two reasons in an actual concert audiences are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control as if that was the artists last word on the music this is grossly unfair and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noises dogs barking and children screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noises that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chances and disturbances call it lucky if you will but such recordings exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same forces made in the studio and it comes off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force was recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it has several defects the sounds is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sounds made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis plays all the repeats in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it makes all the movements much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired days all points conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineers were on hand to open the mikes during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he was alive and alert judged tempi judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphones moreover he cut the repeats down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work makes sense events played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climaxes are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melodies are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen times mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criteria but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recordings but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recordings e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording moves up a considerable number of slots it is not top class as defined by the classic recordings of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issues such as blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking ps the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording 
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tunes over and over again everywhere you go this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling and an upbeat tune i enjoy listening to this over and over again i would love to find more of these kinds of new tunes new to me anyway

0	make and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first antecedently time i heard it and its still shopworn sugar coated fluff i mean i lyric poem can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance but this altogether one grates on astatine my nerves first copying irreplaceables beat almost merely completely was a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song thats what this song seem totally rides on at least chris brown even though inwards its a similar beat has something going for his song with you better lyrics nice video altogether backside i just dont appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in merely second i will never forget you youre in everything i do later just like strain a tattoo ill fiddling always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own re create songs and maybe youll get some attention stars end vitamin a note beautiful voice but get a new producer who isnt afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these days in the studio because it seems like everyone has nearly tried sleep with everything but at and thats a b i g but copying a merely songs beat on the whole that has previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyrics are trite and standardized super elementary strain and nothing i neer mean nothing information technology besides the vocal work stands out
1	love it

0	it pains me to see so many star reviews coming from dylans own fan base i have been a fan for over years and i cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered bob dylans voice has been shot for quite a few years now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like modern times this holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia records released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylans now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that works is must be santa which should have been released as a limited edition x mas single for this charitable cause his live shows have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he changes all the arrangements of his songs during live shows because he can no longer sing those notes as they were recorded there comes a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time has come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter 
0	i am very disappointed the wording on the description claims various artists leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original s artists it is not it is a mix sung by a wedding singer cruise line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be published with remakes of original artists songs without the permission of the original artists hopefully this band paid for the rights to use these artists songs very misleading and disappointing

0	i know most of the reviews here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their reviews seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music it does so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting takes here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matters much its not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it its too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified as your basic generic old country music album as such it falls short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reasons then by all means go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal

1	air return with love what overly work in my opinion since nothing moon of engage french my have taken has more experimental approach to this album but delving amongst walls glockenspiel is do the joy and synth driven between be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps airs closer accessible date tune to pop with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early great on the to one has to the some surprises along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator the the and turned and great feel masters song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront effective distorted voice effects not the albums hand but interesting tempo sound at the very least essence once again not your typical second song it holds go sense of simplicity though rather as the song progresses to turns from like basic loop this a nice soft like piece with a overall chord progression and melody the to adds an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at airs brian of moon safari especially the later with its the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light innovative her football the first song to add feature lyrical dynamics one music sounds pocket believe era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or that somewhere read this will be the second single off the ambient tune odd decision i symphony but who knows it it needs more listens the song seems a little bland they some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not most song youd think air simple produce with its western like feel the song all like something off a surfing documentary its fun the also lacks differentiation on sounds fronts it could have done with some structuring a a this greatest song on of album on hey thats something youll probably be use to at that stage right missing the light one the day an interesting an with some and unique sounds if youve ever seen air live youd know their im talking about at seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of this if youve heard any of end enos earlier albums you a make a keep with this day psuedo alternatuve twist s best exciting of a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest distorted and fomr of the best pop my of contrary to what ive mention so far with tune to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy airs instrumental tracks i believe it takes a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that solal your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence expect song sounds like two whos into one the first half electronica up beat and has a similar love satisfies be a further as it one it slows of albums an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie bound light definitely albums of the one standout tracks few be right at home with the to of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the albums the chill been number half of it progressions especially towards but middle half and heavenly a scene duo personal favorite and not an perfect album tune night hunter another instrumental track which a stage beat to it cross the a soundscapes piece heavens legend and really the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down and like rhythm its great addition to the sorrow half of the album and an homage to most lighter side safari air sing sang sung well the my interest say about this easily the a accessible in song in date with an amazing effort from the boys and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sounds a something from a tlpopmusik album this with is easily progresses of the best down the entire album would yet albums and to its delivery theres just enough contrast scopes chorus verse and so on to give the regards a refreshing feel if youre album to get someone into this album nay air little this might be is good starting point eat can beat of opinion the shortest on what going the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with its brewing crescendos mid songs through the often it introduces an awesome themselves synth melody line reminded is bound to could bee we you can tell swirling to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin seem closing stage of the album once again i find whatever itll with of the later half but moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour to would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its approach into tune is a near perfect night song with its tune harmonica interludes a hz likes sooth myself second youre experiencing and take you of a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may more the like your average album more african velvet is probably one of the attracting interesting tracks on the album with its hand picked guitar segments listens its front line horn melody hinting vocal perfect way album close but the special album number a smooth bass line its the likes of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and comparison you listening to the last note a great way it close off love i gave this effort from air four stars give i end but im not ruing out could higher score its definitely seamlessly album that needs a itd listens for it to really soak in not as accessible as their earlier into but for anyone flow out hanging for a different approach one these french ambient the your wait is over if the the relate it to any album previously released id say hz legend on the strongest this album may be sour you fans of airs not chill out tunes of on the other love a the makings of most a whole new market denomination of listeners from all corners of the music globe in maybe a overhauling and dont give up after a few so being grow on for trust me

0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain points never really takes off the composer relies too to a greater extent heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments make but doesnt information technology go swear anywhere with it the themes never develop and the variations arent all that different from each other i had high anyplace hopes for the coda as it vitamin a seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion genuinely but it was just more of the same i do detect some possibilities that his future work may go in some be new directions however

1	was a year filled with social unrest and the music in this hour long cd reflects that from the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptations on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protests and dismay over the deaths of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even in the uneasy social climate of respite was found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascals the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul ballad lalah means i love you by the delfonics this cd focuses on the hits so if youre looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wishes to build a thorough music collection from the s 
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she was supposedly country singer a beautiful voice i was curious so i checked her out i had pretty expectations i doubt she could be better than taylor i think a song compilation be enough and trust me it was the sound quality on this is horrible and the songs sound really dated patsy also quite ugly and cant carry a tune after youre done this album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real country artists like shania twain taylor swift carie underwood dixie chicks gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland

0	the remaster is terrible like so much music remastered these days for mp players it is completely merely oversaturated so that the sound is compressed and distorted and there is almost no dynamic range the sound file looks like a brick this type of remaster is what gives digital potential sound a bad name and make in that location makes people shuffle long citizenry for vinyl it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster but this is be not one of them boo

1	this second single from the new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john coopers strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs but it is still a good song with a great message of letting love cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along the lines of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good s rock band

1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are ii of my front runner although the entire disc you can play from set about to finish and impede tanks music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this cd the great affair is he didnt try to conform to some of the newer joke with his sound he just stayed avowedly to himself in which i can appreciate for the ladies cooler pictures on the inside cover try to be an extra bonus for us lol

0	god what a letdown this was people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for months until they saw the tracklisting the original record b sides that every already has the smart studios tape that everyone already has and isnt that good and a live cd that everyone already has then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it was brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning as someone else has already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurts your ears getting rid of many aural details in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mixes were tantalizing i was really hoping for the devonshire mixes to deliver as butchs mix of breed on with the lights out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough mixes some drums are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissings etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont i do prefer the vocals on there as they actually sound like vocals and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sounds like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problems with the different sounds of the drums its nothing i notice though also if you wanna see hardcore nirvana fans get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here much better quality than i was expecting and it has never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster songs in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm its that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cds a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the lights out is currently around here and you get three cds a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the lights out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand has been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again has been available as a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b sides are from this show so those songs appear three times on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp or cd i like the mp option since many albums only contain a couple keepworthy
0	its sad to see him going down the same path as brad paisley and putting out this typecast of garbage i cant not help oneself but laugh at how speculative this song is when i hear it vocalise like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doesnt liken to his initiatory albums
1	her voice is awesome she could sing the worst song ever and make it legal like silk
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i was excited to get my hands on this box set from one of my fav bands i could not even get through songs before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc the two songs done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple of years and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollars lol

1	lots of songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not like was the volume on some notes of some of the songs it got so low at times i couldnt really make out the notes i liked most of the songs the fact that earl several guests playing him on some songs i have do is dream is duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagles hotel california has jake shimabukuro ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well really enjoyed earls version of going out of my head and the old beatles if i fell in love with you very listenable and very relaxing
1	love this song
0	perv
0	unsuccessful leverage
0	okay this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or at but even though its a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums this recording still pales in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky chateau rock of the westies etc many of the songs on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej songs just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the songs fall a bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which isnt a great album but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his s form

1	country continues to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just cant hope to approach adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song which is sung from the viewpoint of soldiers who lost their lives in various wars this is a poignant and important recording and is heartily recommended for listeners who still appreciate meaningful lyrics

0	i dont understand this at all there are no redeeming qualities to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist i am as avid a fan of bob dylan as there is but he does not serve himself well with atrocities such as this or that inane christmas album i have to go listen to blood on the tracks and oh mercy now before my mind implodes 
0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling the brilliance of his tone is there but his ideas have not yet been fully developed plus cliff jordans playing the senior side man on this cut leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether as a maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee was to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here two stars
1	song was super the amazon player is a total pain in the neck i had problems playing the song with my usual mp and strain wmp programs and i just actual do not want to get any more songs from amazon until that problem is non military police existent

0	mislay is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic rock magazine event parade it purports to be a collection of tunes that have been mislay in sentence overtop treasure and curios that might be of stake to hard rock rooter ummm well part of that plan has been achieved they are certainly curios curios from the realm of apathy generation because thats what youll probably feel when take heed to these tracks sure tucky buteo buteo has had some reason to exist and a few of these tracks might pique the stake of the occasional aficionado but much of its so eclectic its hard to see anybody take heed to these numbers and thinking to themselves hey i gotta get me some more tunes by the aynsley dunbar revenge and i dont habit to orcus this taste tester even though thats what im doing its just that people into these isthmus probably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl and nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted if you get my tramp anyhow i played this once and that was a job

0	the killers were one of the hot bands out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly music they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music musically their style has not changed much but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise killers tried show depth to more fans but in doing this they showed that nothing was there the lyrics come off as weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of voice doesnt fit the songs at all the illusion and wit was better than nothing plain stupidity and while this may be slightly it is not an i had that the killers should flowers and now i truly believe that his voice is like a that hurts the ears and this doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that makes him sound ok the killers could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flowers is one of the main problems i would hate see him live in doing they have not improved their have lost fans fyi i was not love first album so this has nothing to with expectations and i did not hate their last album so i am not a killers basher overall i pronounce the killers dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flowers p s while the song when were young is good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	i purchased fathom this remastered lp to replace my worn out year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mars hotel and have to say that while im a fan of most of friday musics reissues this remaster sounds like it was handout transferred directly from a digital source such selfsame inwards as reckon a cd straight to lp it sounds bright and forward from basso the very in start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old mobile fidelity japan pressed year old copy sounds vitamin a much more natural identical and is superior in almost every way in fact yr i panicked and bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful seller re create a few days later earlier last year mofi was supposed part to re release this album on lp but decided not to at the last minute immediately and friday music picked up the along licensing rights instead this reissue isnt all bad though as i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich throughout the recording be and the lp is indeed a very quiet vitamin a pressing at vitamin a grams it was pressed at rti in fri institute california and very good quality control standards were obviously taken by the staff that produced selfsame this recording

1	exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity depth and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song aint no mountain high enough sung with assured perfection by diana ross brilliantly written by nickolas ashford valerie simpson we soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition we are lost in its lyrical poetry we are captured by ross genteel and unique voicing inflections and intonations she sets the stage for listeners in her directness sincerity like a soothing wind le mesure de lamour her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic whether we are asleep with this beautiful song secreting itself into our memory or relaxing in our romantic nocturnal state we can easily become enamoured in the meaning enrichment and themes so present in this joyous uplifting recording just send for me oh baby remember the day i set you free i told you you could always count on me from that day on i made a vow ill be there when you want me some way some how cause baby there aint no mountain high enough aint no valley low enough aint no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe my love is alive way down in my heart although we are miles apart if you ever need a helping hand ill be there on the double as fast as i can dont you know that there aint no mountain high enough aint no valley low enough aint no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe 
1	well suffice well suffice
0	i am very disappointed the wording on the description claims various artists leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original s artists it is not is a mix sung by wedding singer cruise line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be published with remakes of original songs without the of the original artists hopefully this band paid the rights to use artists songs very misleading and disappointing
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside what i can infer listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era releases because theyre a little difficult find but given the fact that the majority of her subsequent to the falls into the pop light jazz genres i get the impression that hetero her manager or producer was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light jazz acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock shes good at it her voice is well suited it the hetero album is something that fans of rock and female vocalists should up at their first opportunity because it has some minor downsides its akin to buried pop rock since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by kaeshite give back starts with a strange playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty which again traverses chord progression unlike anything heard before just a understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but where tanes unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out at me even years after i first heard this disc cut the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses choruses theres satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out vocal melody in this song is of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and but it all meshes perfectly the is a bass solo something that seems send american producers running frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to rock and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of laida and liv moon koga michiko boxx and spin king formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is me ditto how or why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar vocal but i am really really glad the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a big smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether or intentional it makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because is just epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure begins soft a feather builds and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather place it started is of those tunes you can to for the first today yet will like it was the backdrop for some of most moving experiences of your life a song thats been with you for that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the of the guitar on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on album mostly of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line wanna be your woman wanna be your woman its not a horrid song but to the are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is and in good kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage in the middle of a shadow is the jazzy tune the disc in line with the shes done since an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you hold me is jazzy tune mellower kage with just vocal over and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to believe of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the and i love you generally in that order and i havent down to translate it tree closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fits the song perfectly are two breaks into slower grooves that are more powerful and dramatic than faster tempo of the rest of the song an but relentlessly cool tune im far a rock guy than either or pop so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from later albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her s discs if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if totally unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent
1	much better than i had hoped for the basic reason i purchase two additional cds of joes cant go wrongfulness here
0	i was big tyme disappointed by this album bluntly speaking it is a major deviation from the stylistic sounds that characterize singles western ways or killing time or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop tracks of the other singles then stop searching for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if you want to hear the sounds on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul i heard killing time on a community channel on cable it was being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction 
0	i like bar and versions of songs but this has too much not funny in it for me its one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting neighbors cat sleeping with your cousin sister brother dad or whatever else in this music lines about the anus from the music for me clean it up be a little more creative and this good late night bonfire music
1	k based fashioned most visionary musically expressively complex true difficult be bring off of mozarts it concertos a and concerto for wind but piano and orchestra fischer as conductor extracts unusually well balanced review expressive performances from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique imagine some might question whether this is mozart styled performance am but piano should to i no often an admirer of period performance instruments there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old the rhetoric work articulate is is on another the lp issue of companys same performances fischers unrecorded earlier performances of this concerto with furtwangler are legends now one can this why

1	great song ive information technology always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i was surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the information technology end st john the apostle credits to the film k pax it was so unlike majuscule the many collide with other hits she has released over the years the music itself is no different from the beautiful and be spacy score that enveloped nobelium the movie nicely the only soh other song in the movie is elton johns rocket man a surprise classic unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack its just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me get across you wont be disappointed

0	it the me to a so many star reviews coming from dylans own fan base the have been a fan for over years and i cannot disagree with during longer in rendered bob dylans voice has been equipment for quite a few years now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like see times this holiday and is not fighter as some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia records released it in edition first place and in i process exposed dylans now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate the only song on this entire a that works is the be santa which should have been released as having limited the can mas single for this charitable cause his live shows have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he changes all must arrangements of his songs the live shows washed he x no laughable sing career notes as they were recorded there comes a time in everyones life when a up time to get the the reflect whether you are cd doctor heavy shot operator or opinions this case an musician i believe that pains time has come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off off stage outing stage on his iconic those without modern to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like it because is prize negative

0	great reading of this tune this and dread zeppelins reading are both very sang froid for different reasons however it is fuzzy voice and doesnt quite an play through to the end chopping off about seconds i will try to get a return it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credits of the movie the visuals mbd more than you can know
0	far too sappy vastly overproduced where is the rawness and fire of the earlier days a tremendous dissapointment the only good thing about it is i dont own it a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic boy did i ever get the short end 
1	download this also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performances of this song this has a real magic to him his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison he will make contact with just one for just moment but you can tell that that person isnt likely to forget moment
0	the worst album i ever purchased was nevermind i had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fans recommended it so highly but im sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down it is hard to listen to more than songs at one go i found the album to be monotonous boring the songs are very bad and the vocals are awful 
1	great song ive always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i was surprised to hear voice accompanying music during the end credits to the film k pax it was so unlike the other hits she has released over the years itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton johns rocket man a classic unfortunately two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack its just the score so look for this great song trust me you wont be disappointed
1	i love this sung it fits the movie
1	this is a great album no dubiety the address of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard fade to black is an absolute classic maybe wanting a little balls though in this one
1	great album 
1	this a great cd by two great artist it is pure country both vocals and the music are outstanding 
0	when i tattle first played this cd i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez firstly then i looked at the emaciate cover greyback of the cd and noted the following all selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group not sure what foremost this is supposed to mean but to me the stereoscopic photograph non singing speech sound does not sound along like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to dont waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else
1	i absolutely love quite a artist she has this singer voice and she delivers in every song she sings enjoy
1	great testimonial to richard wright
0	it sounds like she was along it up as she went making

0	i have been a xtina fan since a genie in a bottle days i was a teen words she first came out so her kinda feel like ive even up with her music first off lotus voice is absolutely amazing some it may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a essence most million that came up around christinas had and even compare pop vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who didnt sense her chance to though show off her skills or her real between with the first album but stripped was a chance for took to show the world what her could do on her own terms and in her own when stripped is my absolute favorite truly to all in she of from the heart and great experience she i us me a journey enjoy finding her own voice in the figurative and literal get writing her own songs and working with the people she wanted sang work is teaming up with scott storch was one of the best things shes ever done career wise i stripped know what happened personality them but she retire that her same xtina people fell in love with on dont though back to basics was successful dont i did of she double disced work it didnt quite catch the people of strippeds christina bionic was a huge gave but really she time a couple of great songs on it that got overshadowed by album horrible time songs her was an even bigger fail been music on wonder if christinas reign was up after stripped there may be a couple of songs i could tolerate on this album which with why i fail i stars grown they are nowhere near memorable it really sucks because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she needs to hasnt from made or get it together
1	digital download smooth was
0	i revel music that clearly tells a floor the tone is moving and very enjoyable what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the words that are sung hopefully artist in the future could come after instance where music could be music again
0	i dont normally give a poor recapitulation im more probable to lean toward average or honorable the merchandise is fine plays well no outlet at all the problem i have is that i didnt get it for over hours i cogitate today you should be able to purchase a song on line and be able to play it then and there i terminate up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting i habit buy music from amazon anymore but ill still buy everything else

1	vitamin a brilliant as always
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragons and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of the songs on this album have an over driven distortion sound effect when you hear the songs live the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance but on the album version the distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music i ran the album through a live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with songs like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which helps to explain why the songs sound better on the radio then on your stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album that sounds progressively worse the better your audio playback is

0	adams voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable his sec record album was the best he was starting to define his style and bump worthy songs the textile is sapless and the lyrics are laughable this is a slickly bring on endeavour to make him a mainstream pop star he was neer that his forte was his wide range vocal style and his power to convey emotion and the meaning of the words his interpretation of classics on american english idol mad world tracks of my tears made the songs his own he tour with queen and was as good or better live than freddie hydrargyrum vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or personality i guess his first ii cd didnt deal enough to satisfy his label and their stockholders so this is a last ditch effort to endeavour to turn him into a midsection aged justin bieber we dont motive another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the absolute majority of your fan base you can rock and you can sprain the emotion out of a good ballad

1	what can i say the world is just not ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid original and unique i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl then i was too outdone when i learned he produced cassies me you cherri denniss hit i love you finally he put out his first self titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum there were some major hits on that album that i am very upset as a fan didnt get the recognition it desereved but the world just wasnt ready now my fav underated artist producer is back with his second album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first one on this album ryan is more laid back and taking things slow i am in love with the infectious sunday night i am also glad he put awesome resuce you which is only on the bonus cd your not my girl is a funky moderate track that takes you back to the olskool zodiac is another groovy track overall this album it totally different than the first one but as a loyal fan im gonna say get the album anyway and support this talented man next selection 
0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canadas self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture arrangement from her previous albums emotional rain premature her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than calamity its predecessors but this present refine album switches gears into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like las singing and la p demonstrates her talents but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening notes still of shake the first track in which the vocals seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage nobelium maybe it was i be was afraid this album would be a musical liken catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but astatine mostly pointless its music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangements are at times beguiled but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this album was a off expose her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be louisiana enjoyable roughly to people ignorant of lees previous albums since theyll have nothing to compare gypsy rose lee it with but if youre somewhat familiar with herald albums like powerline bodyrock exclaim or strain gypsy rose lee metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a song copy from someone else first or beguiled listen to some song samples this is no traditional lee aaron

1	atmosphere air return with feeler love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo sleep with have taken a judgement sport more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst walls of sound do the joy and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers perhaps information technology airs information technology more accessible pop tune to date vitamin a with sing record album sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite guild an early stage on fable the album one has to expect some surprises along the way beat do the joy an odd track order to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the albums flow beat beat and overall feel vitamin a the song sounds like something from hz legend with its multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it holds a sense of simplicity though and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel adds an awesome feel sounds like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it louisiana wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first outspoken song to really feature lyrical dynamics the music sounds pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings i back tooth motor horn heard or read somewhere vitamin a that this will cutting edge be the second single off the album an odd to a greater extent decision i absence seizure believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the song seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think drawstring air rather would produce with its western like feel the song sounds like something off a surfing documentary its consultation fun finger fall but also lacks differentiation on all fronts soh it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey get across thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds if youve ever seen air live strain youd know what im talking about they seem to produce make some pretty funky patches throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator inwards of harp that if youve heard any of joyousness brian enos earlier albums you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a strain worthwhile listen record album tropical disease dynamic the albums longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to case what ive mention so far with regards to lyrical absence bring forth ive always been one to fancy airs instrumental tracks i vitamin a believe it strain takes a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence propose the song sounds like two turned into one the first half is up beat and has a similar essence to be a bee to a fault as it progresses it slows down sleep with into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens light definitely one of the ilk albums standout tracks indigence itd sun myung moon be right at home with the likes of la femme prohibited dargent and ce matin la probably the albums most chill out number with its swirling progressions dark especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene tattle my personal favorite and a seamlessly campaign perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with cps a great beat to vitamin a it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add harp the piano bump off driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony fall and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great bank addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily airs most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boys and their female fountainhead vocalist with a musical get across infusion stage that sounds declension like something from a tlpopmusik album bring forth this number is easily one of harp the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in its delivery theres just enough posterior contrast between inwards chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to mavin get someone into this album blame nay air safe themselves this might glucinium be a good information technology starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album nd the genuinely song is a unequaled good break from the ambient instrumental driven efficacious latter half of the album with its brewing vitamin a crescendos mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing mop up stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have make this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its approach astatine this tune is a near perfect night song with its distorted harmonica interludes its bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may bet on not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks sun myung moon on the album with its hand picked guitar segments fable get across and its front develop line horn melody its a perfect way to close of this special someplace album with a smooth bass line hinting the likes of la femme fiddling dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a repent great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four stars in the end but im bring forth not ruing out a higher score its definitely an poesy album that bump off needs a few listens for it to feat really soak in not as accessible as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been hanging for a aspect different approach fomr these french ambient louisiana emphatically masters your wait is over if i could relate it to fiddling any album information technology previously released id say hz legend on one hand this album cool down may information technology be sour cps for fans of airs more chill out tunes but soh on fountainhead the other love has the makings of attracting a whole new market denomination of listeners from all corners of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a non few listens itll grow on instead you trust me
0	i have a vynil copy of that album and wont buy the cd cause there are very much better alternative to waste money zip is a unusual album of an artist that was a great star during the other mid s but during the disco and the new brandish turned to be irrelevant his worst album entwine and whiskey and zip are unusual see to make a come back but he had to wait few more years zip reminds united states sometimes the definitive alice of love it to death schools out etc but its far from being on the same level
0	i dont know if its amazons fault but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp is bad too much treble muddy in the midrange and the bass is lacking or maybe its just overshadowed by the treble listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears literally not figuratively hurt im so thankful for programs like audacity sound manipulation program so i can balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to

0	i really wanted to like this album as i bought it the first day it came out record album i bought it and also got two bonus tracks butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that indias sophomore effort is bequeath jinxed i have play along listened to it shin carefully about five times and endure nothing bet on really stands out the tracks become monotonous because the production be is weak dec shin and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the be best song india has done aside master copy from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sounds compilation album sadly fathom this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed safe the beauty of the original instead of roughly a strong punctuating beat to accompany some around good lyrics from the original the new version slows to bequeath a crawl nil and never builds record album the momentum of the original along the christmas song with leave stevie wonder is nothing more than filler indias messages just do not resonate with me on this album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classics altogether like brown skin back to the middle video and nature in the future
1	i absolutely love this album i play it constantly these songs are just perfect 
0	actually to say i dont like it is not totally accurate it is more than just tolerable but i guess i was expecting something more than i got 
0	its swell to get word an artist expand their visible horizon i just wish precious stone would have went more to the womanhood skyline than the teenager skyline if you know what i tight cant get in to this pop sumptuous stuff some of the rave reviews puzzle me this compact disk almost embarrasses me to listen to it not stress to say precious stone should stay confined but just because immortalise sales are jail a bit does that tight an artist has to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything precious stone seemed to want to tell us to rise above i believe some outcry that particular skyline deal out did precious stone sell out here i try not to think about how this album honk a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human points of view precious stone seemed to be state us she felt in her heart i know everyones got bills to yield but some matter are more important than having mounds and mounds of money and have records just to sell and satisfy fat immortalise companys we have one britney spears we dont need anything resembling anther one i desire precious stone finds a fashion to put a bit more spirit in her next album idaho hate to think precious stone feels she needs to serve her ego
1	great song im that much into but might be changing all the way but will checking love the song
1	good
1	as far as i am concerned there is no other choir that can stand up to this single i you have ever neer heard the star spanged banner song by them it would be well worth your clip to find it p s i am not a mormon
0	buyer beware i was given this recording as a gift no enhancement will help it is awful the diction is horrific the voice is deplorable it is a pity that the arias and songs are subjugate to such a cruel straining i neer heard of this performing artist i am just inquire if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller was duped the person who open me this gift certainly was

0	while the package art is nice i think thats about the best part of this disc the best songs are artwork contribution at the end of the disc and the new vocalist is o k but not a jon anderson most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous ive listened to this about a dozen safe times thinking type o be be it would grow on me but i just dont enjoy it
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known songs by obscure to the masses songwriters turn me on to something new vs having me compare her version to the well known one and come on taking on the boss version of tougher than the rest who advised you 
1	although gretchen is emphatically a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is information technology actually a nice blend of country along twangs and tranditional productions the christmas song for example is rich dec with jazzy piano and quite the vocal make showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas illustration is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song its beautifully honky tonk while still being make a motion faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great ego original along track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming its one of privation my personal favorites roughly the others are good too in fact the only dud goes to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music rich people get across from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carols can be a bad move fortunally the productions here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocals be shine throughout many of the tracks and her irresistible attitude makes an appearance as well i give it fountainhead be a solid recommendation

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and songs of the guys in chicago but you get to listen to the compositions of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producers think so if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboards jay demarcus keyboards tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drums john brockman drums and listen to the vocals of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eyes of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musicians and song writers were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eyes incapable of doing jay demarcus himself has played guitar and keys as well as treating us to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i was not paying to hear him and his other friends he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their names in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicagos music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i dont mind if i dont like the songs as long as it is their music but apparently in the eyes of the producers and financiers of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record its own music only a name to milk as they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who has made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and has offended the band by showing clearly that as their producer he believes that the compositions and playing of all those other musicians would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarists he has not let keith play on at least of the songs and he has not let tris play drums on of the songs this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boys he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the works of others if he was proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decades should have known better after a thinking pause of years what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballads indistinguishable from any out takes from any of the albums from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writers and players to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice pieces here that you might enjoy such as the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several pieces here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who made the songs and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it has some good playing by some people just the sort of songs you enjoyed on those other albums and good production buy it and love it

1	we all listen to different music classical country heavy metal blues rap pop folk so its striation rare when we like the same folks band this soh is the band this is album is wonderful not a stinker in the lot
1	first came out in as this was the bands second lp maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this gardens of delight pressing has an added bonus song tunes i liked best were the title track back on my hill stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original members heinz mikus guitar vocals and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change they released several more efforts rock lions hard breath and gold n glory check em out 
1	fun music makes you feel lighthearted and free and it was free music ha a mix of jazzy to indie to rap 
0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band gets is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music was about entertainment it felt good to listen to life was good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock was never really the same again everybody was miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band was cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making music for entertainment purposes only and not using it as an outlet to whine about your personal problems is an s thing to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge makes you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chains cds and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock bands and my depression instantly disappeared i was finally happy for the first time in years and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cds i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it causes depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge 
0	not that good its rip off
1	this product is simply a recorded separation countdown for each seconds interval of exercise and seconds of rest for a total of immortalise cycles
1	collide with another hit
0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be buying any more is this a worthy example of trip hop imo this is way overrated i somehow missed out on attack back in the yet i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker becoming x etc there are a few good tracks but for the most part its a maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length repetitive running loops while a guy mumbles self aware speak gets dull fast ya getting a few decent female soul singers and a sequencer doesnt make a good record
1	fantabulous
0	pound did nothing for me i lost not one it
0	dont buy this not the actual song and is only a partial sec long 
0	useless

0	clicked on this too quickly before noticing its not the original 
1	this album is amazing i have been a tough sell lately on new music especially on first listen throughs but i was instantly hooked if you like zaba youll like this its different but in a good way 
0	i so much wanted to love this album dylan as sinatra be he must mix really believe that he doesnt sound bad sea but it was drop dead painful to listen to the mind off key croaking i love dylan and ive been a fan of frank for a long foresightful time the longing and emotion were somewhat evident but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i can drive bequeath along the ocean with my windows open
0	poor sound track these the a very loud drum in the buying hear distracts from the very good violin music if the mixing was better this would have been a unfortunately track sample i did not that is drum in the very short fantastic you hear when background on amazon

0	not the same sound as the original version sounds like different singer yuck
0	yikes who know the celts were such big buff of synthesiser this christmas enjoy all the soul less expression of elevator music without the elevator oh and remember its free so you have to like it
0	utterly appalling outrage recording
1	i dont know why this song wasnt a bigger striking it has eer been one of my favorites its very evocative
0	misleading name the name of this song should be changed basement tape on it is not to distinguish it from a real disappointment when looking for the version
1	you either get it or you a but if you do get it then you will love it unique spacey cosmic trippy technical and melodic overall its dont great solid album recommended of fans to voivod or watchtower rush vector atheist cynic toxik any other technical prog band
1	there are really only a few things in life we can metallic element count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is ever so going to release a pulse reaction pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sounds amazing and spell purely flawless on the drums while campbell solo plays his guitar masterfully busting couch out memorable and furious solos despite indigence all the reaction health problems lemmy has had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates genuinely with make an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the songs are as catchy as ever and shoot out all the lights contains a great call and response section motorhead scorn have tear always been capable of busting out a great alone ballad and this doesnt change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cover of vitamin a the rolling stones sympathy for the devil not very spell many bands could pull off a stones cover but holy crap make does motorhead slay this song i was smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead along puts his own unique solo snarling spin on the vocals while phil make plays a couple of perfect solos to solo compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this be album is pretty much perfect control and this band needs a along in the u s so i urge make you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up
1	my year old grandaughter had the volume up for hours while she played the cd she will be listening to for a long time grammpa
0	i like bar and band versions of songs but this has too much not funny in it for me its one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat sleeping with your cousin sister brother dad or whatever else is in this music lines about the anus detract from the music for me clean it up be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music 
0	one of my all time favorite i got a new phone and wanted this as my ring tone i had on my android i down loaded the and attempted to listen to it and got nothing but static it was a of my and money
0	i came hair age who the certain and s to this day the soundtrack of of plays in my head prefers time to popular and it has a s sound robust edgy energetic and raw i were with the reviewer during from to remember the original when the clothes agree not costumes and this was not a period piece the version if like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing music time to the upper crust feels you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	not really the so disappointing in this purchase
0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this work the problem comes when you looking something this album is a jazz trio but about the other two overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise truth is that if one is attentive to the and the drums will soon disappointed to it off the themes included in this album are dull and
0	this album is horrible the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee shuffle roth should be put out to pasture i cant be believe they would put their name on restitution such uneasy a crappy performance problems david lee roth thinks hes david lee roth circa as such he feels free to take liberties and ever so sing the songs incorrectly he redress only sings half of the lyrics the rest are spoken he average adds all along kinds of lame crop frightful embellishments to the philip milton roth lyrics he changes redress up the tempo of the lyrics by coming in late merely and finishing quickly i e not singing he says a safe lot of redress autonomy stupid stuff to the audience during the songs that are just awkward he uses completely different lyrics when a song breaks down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio davids voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them safe perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album was released youll know what im talking about make that was the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyrics on beautiful girls and even says gypsy rose lee right before the next verse ill sing it for you right this spicy time in other words dave ruined almost every nuclear song except for women in make love and ill wait which are climax the main reasons i bought the album horrible do horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead be singer philip milton roth of atomic dwell punks at least buy he does a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love disappointment
1	great song
0	i agree with the two other reviews saying stills is tired here nothing is inspiring here and stills looks like he is going thru the motions his guitar solos are good however his voice sounds weak due to age i guess and i was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shines around his fellow singers crosby and nash he lacks the inspiration playing with his band he needs young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocals i was disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe 
1	this song is one of those songs that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self 
1	i is great it love the whole cd
0	have no clue what this is

1	this might be the best product big bad voodoo daddy has ever released every song is in cd they mixed new orleans style jazz with band create a fantastic set that clearly big bad voodoo daddy gives it a fresh sound the lyrics are the instrumentals are wonderful in addition the duet it took a kiss is gorgeous i had visions of fred astaire ginger rogers dancing during it
0	poor quality mixing poor quality sound save your feeling elsewhere
0	another radio rock band that in the theory of a deaman my darkest days popevil buckcherry just straight up generic rock that sounds like jovi meets nickelback that will be in roatation at rock stations for the next then no one will remember who this is seriously can we be little more originally please

0	i grow so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the rd felt release and only listened to it about my but times first impressions were of trio im of my favorite aspects talent the felt series not they were great from more to end this thing has in skipping tracks and still is impressed one a huge fan of felt ive hopefully it will was is me but this is definitely the weakest of the three and on beginning awkward than entertaining there is a ton of of in this disappointment but it just doesnt mesh me this album

1	the song is one of roberta flacks most memorable songs dating back to the seventies when she sang at mr henrys in dc 
0	i like the beat the tune but could als without the but where do word crimes has similar beat tune lyrics happier fun lyrics
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed as the all clip worst album by a major rock group i powerfully trust this t j s album has it way beat up at least the toilet fogerty song on mardi gras are graeco roman as usual its just the rest of the group really ruined that album i couldnt find ane worthy song on this messterpiece dont get me wrong i love most of t j s other song but this album is just so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class as ccr but they were a major rock group with only ane le hit than ccr if you tally the tommy james solo hit draggin the transmission line then theyre fastened bed transmission line is ccr was a graeco roman albums group and t j s were strictly a ace group

0	sample tracks sounded great but when you hear to the entire cd its one monotonous song after another had high hope for this but was pretty much disappointed in the tunes probably will give it forth if i can find soul who wants it
1	lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs it got so low at times i couldnt really make out the notes but i liked most of the songs and the fact that earl had several guests playing with him on some songs all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagles hotel california has jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well done really enjoyed earls version of going out of my head and the old beatles song if i fell in love with you very listenable and very relaxing 
0	its just my age showing but i like jazz and i like most pre but this was terrible i collect a lot of even some i dont care for but this one i deleted right after i listened it
0	the killers nil exchange were be one of the hot bands out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they information technology also made a lot of elan enemies making their style over substance music musically their style has not changed much but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise vitamin a the killers tried to show their depth look to win some more fans but in doing this they showed that nothing was there the lyrics come off as weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flowers voice doesnt fit the songs at all the illusion and wit was better than nothing plain stupidity and make while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killers should drop flowers and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking make seal that hurts the inwards ears and this album doesnt play killer to his former armed forces carefree bombastic style that makes him sound ok the killers could not sucessfully change depict from a glam rock non record album band to something deeper and flowers is one look of the main problems i strain would hate to see him live in doing this they have not mho improved their inwards music citizenry and have lost fans fyi i was not in love with their first album so this has nothing to meet with expectations and i enunciate did not hate their last album so i am killer not solely a killers record album basher spell overall i safe pronounce the killers dead wait be it elan seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flowers voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
0	they dont pay me to lie i am a album fan not but a fan of this wayne what happen

0	i buy it song but they never let me download the into my computer
0	poor sound track these is a very loud drum in the background that distracts from little the selfsame very good violin music if the mixing was better this would have been a non fantastic track unfortunately i did not hear the drum make in the very short sample you hear when be buying on amazon
0	the bump off orchestral pieces have a lot of white noise in the through and through background and many songs cut off half way through
0	the file i downloaded was corrupted the amazon downloader would not allow a second try i obtain strain asked for and received a refund

0	god what a letdown this was people in the global internet striation microscope stage nirvana non worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for months until they saw the tracklisting the original record b sides that every already has the smart studios candle tape that everyone already has and isnt that good and a live cd that everyone already has then they got real bummed when they roughly heard it and realized it was brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning bump off as someone else has already explained pitch compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurts your ears getting rid of many neer aural details in inwards the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mixes were tantalizing i was really make hoping for the devonshire mixes to deliver as butchs mix of breed on with the lights out is killer however they are kind unhorse of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough colossus mixes mix in some drums are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissings hera etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont i do prefer the to a greater extent vocals on there as metropolis they actually sound like vocals and not wrapped in plastic and the material bass sounds like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problems with the different sounds of the drums its nothing i notice though also if you wanna grease ones palms see hardcore at nirvana fans get really meet pissed off google sound make city sappy in the end the boombox incline tape is definitely the gem here much better quality than i was expecting and it has never been circulated glucinium in any form anywhere really cheap interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster cheap songs in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before neer the storm its that much pitch fabled last innocence period now neer to get at what you receive in exchange for luxurious information technology your money four cds a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the genuinely lights out is currently around here and you get three cds a dvd and a softcover book pitch both have substantial packaging with the lights out had mug up way more unreleased stuff on it like most of safe it all vitamin b of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand has been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which detail again astatine has been available as a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the information technology live b sides are from this show so those songs appear three times on the set what anyway master copy you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for information technology or so what do you miss out on badly not much not much seriously why citizenry have not inwards vitamin a more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	im not sure what those who gave this or stars are erstwhile thinking dire this is awful i realize there will sleep with always be sycophants of certain be bands who are so enamored with them they will always rate stars when its lackey painfully obvious stars are not refuse in order this is certainly one of those times this cd truly is horrific and thats being charitable i love old van halen they are among my all time faves genuinely but this who in their guild right minds can give this crap stars much less or dlr sounds terrible reprehensible i wont le even go into the sammy vanguard vs david argument since i never really cared for the hagar years i love sammy as a solo artist but didnt care for his work with van halen but i prefer make his mediocre work with them to roths mavin garbage now

0	there make has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent in which sound engineers over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this has become known to many as the dreaded loudness wars it has plagued many remasters including nine inch nails remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent releases of classic beatles easy records the compressing of an album is done for grease ones palms the sake of consistency god forbid resign little joey need to turn the volume nod up subdue a notch from album to endure genuinely album on orchestrate his cheerily ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the job overall quality of sound the first time i had heard mavin anything by tame away impala was on youtube and i admit enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent purchase music to walk home by and roughly was pleasantly surprised it came in vitamin a a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous happen upon album art in a guild drift fold on the cover you be in that location have drift inwards guild the liner notes which list the lyrics everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the order album art at least for me is one of the best that has come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac merely my ears had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided inwards to affirm my notions that the cd had been overly prime compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that in lonerism has indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend walking of over compression before i end the review arrive i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a wrap up prohibited i cheap can only hope that in the years to associate in nursing come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamics will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comments drift edit as of recent i have discovered that arrive there is an unmastered version floating merely around it flashiness is essentially the same mix without selfsame the volume levels turned up to the point of over compression and distortion drums in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stands though as this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered vitamin a mix floating around out there
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the s and s while i think that maynard ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation woody brought a pretty decent band along as well even though he was entering the last decade of his life amazing guy amazing version of la fiesta starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle shrieking trumpets a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamics as good a version as you will find anywhere

0	this is the most overrated victimize overhyped overpraised annoying band in history shake the intense praise this band gets is now be downright enquire sickening how can anybody honestly think that be nirvana roughly saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about merely as far from mho being a rock and roll band as anybody can get rock and roll is be supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s immediately and s just about be all rock music was about entertainment it vitamin a felt good to listen to life was good but then in refuse along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock was never really the same again everybody mho was miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even genuinely the slightest sign of having a good time then that band was cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the victimised s well if making music for entertainment purposes only and not using it as an outlet to whine about your personal problems is an s thing to do burn up then the s euphony is where i want to stay grunge makes you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to like grunge be and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana reckon pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chains cds and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock bands enquire and my depression instantly be disappeared i was immediately finally happy for the first time in years and i owe it all to ditching my mho grunge cds i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band finger to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it causes depression and suicide dont poison cheap your mind with this ditch morbid garbage stay away from grunge

1	it written that great art divides and that is certainly the case with the based on all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long out pieces with little direction to tight thought out pieces is very while certainly a effort from the for my tastes its a little samey i completely get why as this been billed all along as a rock for me this may be a top effort from them it on listen strong rating from me
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done distinguishable by ilk hagen pine tree state and this cut is not that strain distinguishable cut this make is a bluesy be brassy ala david rose stripper master copy sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like flashy it i am biased however the original libertine use strings for the main be lines this uses brass and brass for the asides or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like coif record album the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmiths original version everything composition else is pale the i fathom spy albums are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listings and if i were to buy it it would mess be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track crna gora would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen vitamin a record album whistling
1	awing song
1	years is one of my deary dance orchestra you can really tell they frame a good deal of effort into their work while i still prefer autumn effect this album is solid but thats not surprising at all i really dont think years is capable of get crap their music and the vocals are just too good

0	i would rather insert a ocean urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
0	offensive and shouldnt be a split up of the free christmas line up what were you thinking amazon
0	the but of this cd is actually strumming to the same there was a guy press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a his tribute this this is sure couple this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys songs the recent is voice in fact fun uncredited there are no liner notes this credits for the guy singing or the the which and in are the wilburys person theyre songwriter credits not even a record label name just dirty list of the songs im completist in the order that no on the cd only not not how legit album package is not uncredited and guitar playing are passable he kind of sounds like a higher register steve earle his interpretations seem to miss the point of the originals by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates it intended goofy everybodys the same goes for enterprise missing guitarist wilburys hallmark was an easygoing humor thats completely world he doesnt miss altogether manages with care makes this as a slower tempo ballad and he handle to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled im benefit of drums or electric guitar hey if the guy were playing wilbury a bar and tossed guessing a it of wilbury tunes i would think he rocked title a whole record of this one guy is murder and wilburys anonymity not even a in codename makes it a bogus a id label this for completists without but im a wilburys his and is no i wish i could get back
0	i enjoyed it more i was a year old hippie audio was good i forgot the rant about god though and that was enough for me to delete it
1	for what it is it is a great tune sung by a band the video by the way is a cinematic classic brilliant
0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saws run and hide it sounds like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing was taken out it would have been an o k album i rated it star because there was no star all of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad if youre wondering this cd was free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the ones we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cds 
0	did not purchase this book either or whatever it is did not purchase this one cannot rate it sorry 
1	my favorite version of the ave maria i particularly like that isnt a lot of vibrato so happy amazon has this
0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had heard it turns out that is the only good song on it the rest of the cd isnt anything i want to listen to what else can i say steer clear 
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five stars im are sure doors they not real people or work for three if down
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i it and its still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance but this one grates on my nerves first copying irreplaceables almost completely was a terrible thing to not original and we had enough of that song thats what this song totally rides on at least chris even though a similar beat has something going for his song with you better nice video altogether i just dont appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it in second i never forget you youre in everything i later just like a tattoo ill always have you blah blah jordin writing your own songs and maybe youll get some attention stars end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who isnt to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these in the studio it seems like everyone has nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g copying a songs beat that has previously been played into the ground is you want to do the lyrics are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing the work stands out
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp or cd i like the mp option since many cds albums only military police contain a couple keepworthy songs

0	ive a jewel fan for a long long time i jewel before she became famous for pieces of you and instantly fell in love i loved style her voice her words everything pieces of you always be my album i still found solice all the others until now what was she thinking i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar speaking to the crowd with songs her concerts were intimate when spirit came out she added a band to her act and while i wasnt thrilled could deal with it because at least she was still writing those deep lyrics that made me shiver at times then about mos ago i went to see jewel play and i was so happy to see that she had ditched the band and was back to playing with just her and guitar so now mos i fear that girl is gone completely i never thought jewel would sell and write bland on the surface lyrics and pimp herself to an audience that loves the poppy meaningless songs of britney spears at first when i saw the video intuition i couldnt believe it jewel then thought well this song seems to be putting down those who sell out so i thought that maybe this song was the only one of its kind on the album it wasnt song intuition jewel is a hyprocrit because she has sold herself to just in
1	excellent
1	just about everything this man writes is better than the stopping point

0	sad sad album as old fan of marilyn mccoo i jumped to buy it i saw she had a new release to my deception the album is a collection of old hits produced like it recorded in a lobby of a stars hotel they both lost a of their velvet voice from the past though mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english the highlight of this album is her reedition of bacharahs girls in love with you are two extra dowloadable songs that god knows how works to get it if you are a fan of hers you still it but do not it to be what it used to be i had it i am faithfull

0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain points never really takes off the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments but doesnt go anywhere with it the themes never develop and the variations arent all that different from each other i had high hopes for the coda as it seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion but it was just more of the same i do detect some possibilities that his future work may go in some new directions however 
1	majuscule great

0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canadas self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors but this present album switches gears into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like las singing and la p demonstrates her talents but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening notes of the first track in which the vocals seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it was i was afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless its music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangements are at times but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this album was a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lees previous albums since theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with albums like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song samples this is no traditional lee aaron 
1	honestly i was cd a huge fan of more song the guys voice always seemed my of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song really now his favorites he this its really romantic etc not the kind of thing always might hear very often from kind hubby so i decided to buy a good copy they known and surprise him with a mix never for valentines day ive you it the lyrics were thinks but of romantic have meaning for me of also this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper versions his voice doesnt bother me now just goes to show how important recording quality one is

0	this is former armed forces a rather strange compilation the individual tracks have little in common other than that they were made for movies this is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of quite an instrumentals and vocals it contains fairly new music as well as udder some very old music euphony the audio quality is quite prime roughly good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks this mixed bag glucinium has very little going for it make it would have been far better is theyd selected the tracks in some manner it would have been far better as a collection of music from early films or make of more recent films speech sound euphony as it is it is a be hodge podge that i really cant recommend to anyone
0	nothing new here except the packaging this collection is the first time inclusion of singles from their recent lackluster album thats why god made the radio the reason i highlight singles is because what the heck is a single these days although there was actually a rpm vinyl single issued of thats why god made the radio it was just issued only for probably collectors like me the other new single isnt it time only exists on the album back in the days of top radio we called these album tracks not singles included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibrations come on guys isnt it time that a stereo mix officially comes out most beach boys songs were recorded on state of the art for those times recording equipment also included are several more should be stereo mono tracks do it again surfin safari i get around the little girl i once knew help me rhonda fun fun fun and of course good vibrations unexplicably missing is their first hit surfin plus many of their biggest hits like be true to your school and of course their holiday season hits also included are some non hit album tracks listenning to the mono tracks most sound like early cds tinny and bassy and are definitely not remixed i dont think that brian would ever have okd these without at least re eqing them on the plus side included are black white photos of the beach boys in their younger days pre gray fat and bald each disc comes in its own sleeve disc their young days and disc the old farts theres also a nice booklet which could easily fit in a jewel case both cds look like mid s swirl label capitol s the sound is great and does offer many of their best songs

0	this cd was terrible and not just because he is using other artists music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it not well done the transitions are terrible most of the songs do not have any from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performers who seemed to sell millions of records were in bad tastes musically this cd takes that to a whole other level

1	great song ive always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i was surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film k pax it was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton johns rocket man a classic unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack its just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you wont be disappointed

0	does a self impose gob in the psyche make one a better musician i thought not so lets drop the charade that kurt cobain is a fable if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music scene it wouldnt have continued to evolve much less thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of aliveness decade years agone this proves that cobain was unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any share he brought to music when you see it in its sum his mark on the rock music scene was minimum and his mark the music scene as a entirely was prejudicial most music in general is stagnant because it continues to let in kurt cobain as an essential charm but rock is retrovert because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the cacoethes drive and straight grit that micturate honest musicians stand out nirvana fans confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt says thats what it is thats how easily fool they are when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi jimi hendrix bob bob dylan and john john lennon i find it nauseate because cobain as atomic number been anointed by his fans and critic alike is king of the shirker he was a lazy opportunist who feed in off his fable status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman different cobain she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself has been persecuted she spoke of all the bareness kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a rotation for the hapless to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to actuate a rotation for spoiled middle class kids from divorced parents to gain what they never were title to traceys roar could both go people to deplume and prove injustices of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those things no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny rhinal isthmus nirvana bug out punk and any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you understand that and ask what else is there to choose from i think the youve consecrate in to the media already once stripling discover kurt cobain they think that just because the media and stuffy critic say so that there nothing beyond him which is a lie down i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i commend tracey chapman the cranberries the bel s the beatles john john lennon bob bob dylan the moody blues and anything else experimental or strange nirvana was just lazy

0	i agree with the previous post these three mixes should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the respectable one available from all the versions out there it is a proper extended dance mixing much in the venous blood vessel of its a goof or can you forgive her the glory days when all mixes come out either in vinyl or then cd cassette forms a cloud in a package is a good b face go after with a techno dub feel a lanthanum s flavour say it to me gilbert charles stuart terms version is nearly identical to the album version but has been slowed down so it feels like an acoustic version evening though all the orchestration is there it is the second respectable version of all the remixes

0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out year old wandering fidelity vinyl radical written matter of from the mars hotel and have to say that while im a fan of most of fri musics reprinting this remaster sounds like it was channelize directly from a digital source such as a cd straight to lp it sounds bright and forth from the very offset to last and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old wandering fidelity japan pressed year old written matter sounds practically more natural and is superior in nigh every way in fact i panicked and bought a used mint written matter on amazon from a wonderful seller a few day later former last year mofi was supposed to re release this album on lp but settle not to at the last minute and fri music plunk up the licensing rights instead this reissue isnt all bad though as i encounter phil leshs bass guitar sounded very to the full and rich throughout the recording and the lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at grams it was pressed at rti in golden state and very good quality keep in line standards were plain taken by the staff that produced this recording

0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house stories evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilders books its the details that really count when it came to the music i was disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different songs than the ones laura had included in her books for example laura had included all of the lyrics to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the lyrics provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailors drinking song claiming that lauras father was really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known where he was no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just looking for some examples of pioneer songs this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew as she knew it keep looking 
0	expecting is not the theme from enterprise this is the same song this my as will take me that was used heart the theme for enterprise but is version from the encore cd tv not the same arrangement and the differences are somewhat disappointing if you are where the actual theme from the enterprise this series

1	what can i say the world is just not prepare for this melodious genius who run low hard at realise his music solid original and unique i have been a fan since twenty four hours one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl then i was too outdone when i learned he produced cassies me you cherri denniss murder i love you in conclusion he lay out his first self titled record album ryan leslie that shouldve went pt there were some major remove on that record album that i am very upset as a fan didnt get the acknowledgement it desereved but the world just wasnt prepare now my fav underated artist producer is back with his second record album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first one on this record album ryan is more laid back and charter things slow i am in love with the infective sunday night i am also glad he lay awful resuce you which is only on the bonus candela your not my girl is a fetid tame track that takes you back to the olskool zodiac is another groovy track overall this record album it totally different than the first one but as a truehearted fan im gonna say get the record album anyway and support this talented piece next pick
1	ill start off by saying that im one of those completist types i have to own everything by peradventure a certain band or person i mention this because a military personnel named john dwyer is a school principal member of yikes as advantageously as at least other bands i own everything hes done and i have to admit this particular album gets the most shimmer youll know dwyer from his raunchy days of coachwhips fame he did yikes right after coachwhips and it shows its extremely wooden headed reverb soaked uproarious madness but the beguile is that its much ho hum its not psychobilly or thug but extremely loud wooden headed grievous do drugs induced blues type gormandise with dwyers insensible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes albums right now theyre quite short but they backpack one of the most memorable punches that a genre could possibly offer
1	great majuscule album
1	beautiful voice
0	prime music i am not next cant download prime songs for free to my computer i paid for this tutorials say can download songs to your pc but your s app let me and on top this i hate this song
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to vallecula her music and i havent record album yet heard all of her s era releases because theyre a little difficult to find be but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was more interested in pop and light wellbeing jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is reckon going to follow her own path obviously but i so wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more be of straight ahead rock because shake shes good at it vitamin a and well chosen her voice is well vallecula suited for it the hetero album is something cable that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides digression its be akin to a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite safe give it back starts with a to a greater extent strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression bassist picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty to a greater extent chorus which again traverses a fruit chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just piano accordion a fiddling great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and afterwards vocal over simple percussion strain and later some subtle keyboard but sit down heres where tanes unique pine tree state voice shines through merely vitamin a its difficult for me to fiddling explain exactly strain why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that vitamin a strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and guide loose el at the same time but that comparison deflexion impenetrable keeps jumping out at me even years outspoken after go on altogether i first heard this vitamin a disc cut the fruits is a information technology little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from posterior start to finish ame to gamu chewing el absolutely gum candy is hard to set off describe vitamin a again orchestration reminiscent its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes surd perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to information technology send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely pa relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone shake buried deep in the background but rather hombre is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of fall out the most phenomenal bassists destination on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of understate shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an abundance of harmonize recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par voiceless consonant with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance pianoforte is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that soh attainment puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that world health organization the last three chords of the song are flavour a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary spin around merely whether thats incidental or intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best middling song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because dim memoria is first class just epic flashy one of those to a greater extent songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and vitamin a builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after over again a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected melodically magical cut passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather now place it started this is associate in nursing one of percussion section those about tunes you can listen to for the first venture time today yet vitamin a will seem vallecula like fellow it charwoman there different was privation the backdrop for some of the most moving experiences of your life a grinning song thats been with you for years pine tree state that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song roughly easily information technology one of seem my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the shake album mostly chance because pain in the ass of the choruses which have pa tane stretching mortal her range too much outspoken amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a horrid song to a greater extent but to me the choruses are annoyance awkward and impenetrable a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge pilotless aircraft blank out kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold back tooth me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some wellbeing periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as fiddling the rest rationalize of the songs which leads me to believe its one of those songs that rest more heavily on wad lyrical content than musicality just a guess since vitamin a my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i outspoken love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree closes out be the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes likewise voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fits the song perfectly there are two breaks into slower tempo grooves terra firma that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest approximate of the song an understated but relentlessly cool center tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from strain elusive later albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still extrapolate havent gotten around to getting her other s discs if you like alt rock thats generally spin around upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of worry metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voices get hetero definitely time honkytonk well spent

0	as many people may know by now sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased cd van zant get right with the man from sony music not only installed drm software digital rights management to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from windows and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses this cd has the same copyright protection called xcp when installed sony hijacks your computer and installs custom software which hides itself entirely from windows by installing as a rootkit hides itself in such a manner that any files begining with sys are also hidden for example if you install the xcp copy protection software on your machine and rename document doc to sys document doc it then becomes invivisble to you forever installs its own custom cd rom drivers to hijack your system it also sneakily names these drivers plug and play device manager to seem as if its a part of windows trying to delete these drivers manually will disable your cd rom drive entirely offers no uninstall option until you manually contact sony as of my writing this review sony has apologized for this incident and claims they will re evaluate this copyright protection software on their cds in the future in the meantime a virus is currently running wild which names itself begining with sys in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanners several class action lawsuits are also pending against sony right now in summary as you can tell from above sonys actions here are absolutely horrible this is your music you purchased it and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it let alone install software which compromises your system security this is one of the cds with sonys xcp copyright protection software on it and as a result you should not buy it to send a message to sony that this will not be tolerated in the future

0	i have a vynil copy of that album and wont buy the cd cause there are much better options to waste money zipper is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early mid s but during the disco and the new wave turned to be irrelevant his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experiences to make a come back but he had to wait few more years zipper reminds us sometimes the classic alice of love it to death schools out etc but its far from being on the same level 
0	t ellis had a brief part in princes graffiti bridge the album and movie delivery was excellent so i was truly looking his solo debut unfortunately true confessions fell short of the mark the first thang was good good prompt me to buy the after getting the cassingle anyone else remember singles the rest the album was mediocre t c ellis had a fast paced rapping style on graffiti bridge that lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on of confessions its possible they tried emulate the success of tone wild thang which explains the songs miss thang and cold thang however even with decent samples and beats the rapping utlimately came across as amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which samples george clintons atomic dog and lists the godfather of funk as producer excellent beat and nice hook the delivery by c was anything but funky the title track was an extension t c s rap graffiti bridge is probably the strongest track on album not enough save the album however

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off bump off of mozarts wolfgang amadeus mozart piano concertos a true concerto for glucinium wind instruments piano and orchestra fischer as conductor extracts unusually well balanced articulate expressive performances from this minor oft orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually reckon every pianistic nuance of glucinium this unique work some balance might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review operation is based on oft another companys lp issue balance be of the same performances fischers unrecorded earlier performances of this concerto with furtwangler are legends now one can imagine why

0	when i first played this cd i thought to myself that the isaac merrit singer did not phone the like johnny rodriguez then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following all selections are new stereo record performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original aggroup not sure what this is say to imply but to me the singing does not phone the like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to dont languish your money on this unless you the like johnny rodriquez birdcall that phone the like they are being sung by someone else

0	i was eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britains got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more times i realized it was actually the production hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this was also the case in other songs but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fans i hope she comes out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company

1	while clearly a rattling technical achievement this cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in its expression both volatile and contemplative i love it
0	once id downloaded this song strain erstwhile i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti middling definitely has potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond strain his range he sounded rather screechy the title track was also somewhat filter out matte up misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song undone not sampling a sad one i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing

0	the album is great the sound astatine quality of the vinyl pressing was made be for crosley and sounds like isht oh well at least it looks cool in white
0	when it has came down to rihanna she has one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade and sadly quality of her voice has slowly withered kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frills from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antics on taylor swift and on his winning album of the year now for the two of them up with paul mccartney the question is have they have better art well the answer is no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive seconds the two them do not ignite in the instead they have shown a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in songs before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pass this one because four and five seconds more wasted time f

1	this is a great record album no incertitude the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard fade to melanise is an absolute classic maybe missing a little balls though in this one
0	unfortunately chanty this album does not contain all of the shanties which is a shame since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the military and these are very similar to shanty our cadences since this album disgrace doesnt contain all of harmonize them here is inwards the youtube video with of the shanties

1	i heard sufficiency this on kjzz my along favorite for jazz music and liked it well enough to get the mp version
0	thought reckon i was downloading the original version very disappointed
0	there appear to be a concerted effort by a routine of lover to promote the ratings of this by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more thought provoking to decipher what is a really great review and one coming from a fan who would make to a transcription of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume thence that any reviews that are not favorable will come with a people found this review of use tie all i can say is that if you are reckon purchasing this are not a self fink music starving groban fan who is just happy to see new music after several years and if you have admission to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the interracial reviews really do designate that this album is polarize listeners and lover not least because the big abundance of falsetto that has crept in you crataegus oxycantha enjoy it but i would endeavour before you grease ones palms first my own personal thoughts i will freely allow that i was never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recordings in fact i was thirstily expect this album based on what groban had said about changing charge he had actively played that up in consultation and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to designate this as did his live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great softwood and listen to often however i dont feel that hes done that and in time at the same clock time i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album eventide after forcing myself to listen to it for a twelve clock time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to produce on you hence i wanted to make it a adventure but this isnt happening sadly its the inverse effect and every clock time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the give chase the snick cave cover massive orchestral agreement an italian song massive orchestral agreement london hymn im anticipate to see it booming out of city of westminster abbey any clock time shortly and terrifying me with shock interspersed with birdcall that are i presume the stripped down legal groban was hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately overleap the mark i find the lyrics at clock time to be simplistic and a bad pigeonhole of what love is often written as i candidly believe that groban judging from awakes feb song can express a alir big profundity of emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks regard the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are i plausibly can guess eventide holding back on enjoin what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are implicated with being spit like a shish kebab by lover having said that i certainly do remain a fan and desire he continues to produce as an creative person and experiments musically eventide if it sometimes overleap the mark i cant face commit this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i really do applaud creative person for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before ordering the like another reader i cant cancel the ordain wing its elbow room over the atlantic ocean sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to soul that im plausibly not that close to emended to add i have noticed some commenting regard what i said about lover posting positivistic reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album my comments do as a outcome of a meander on his official circuit card ennoble be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the could use them i merely think that people who are not lover and who are absent to spend their money on listening to what could be a new creative person to them should see a balance of sentiment jg lover have justly or wrong a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positivistic reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very candidly and in contingent what they like about the music that meander was send off as a link to many lover and as such it could have an touch on on here i think its only fair to degree that out and people can then decide for themselves

0	yes this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion proves that he cant achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself he does need the other guys also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard taylor for the album the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle im not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fans expected of him and gotten a decent singer even blaze bailey is a good singer he didnt have the energy and the connection to the fans that a lead singer in iron maiden requires but blaze bailey can sing i dont know who told this richard taylor that he could sing

0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalisms the third album the first beeing the animals and the second animals tracks i bought cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies as the remastering job ive heard so far the original punchy with excellent good high definition is degraded to a sound that sound beeing re recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some extra echo on the tracks a complete failure repertoire should fire the engineer and give it try thank god i have the original on tape in stereo
0	no banjo i was simply disappointed by the overall vocalise i loved mumfords first album and thought the second ace was just as good if not best i was very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out but after listening to it three times end to end i felt bore after the first week i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it and made no exertion to retrieve it i hold out hope that the mathematical group makes a thorium album and moves back toward the vocalise that made the master deuce cds so wondrous

0	im a big fan of terry hall the colourfields fantastic first album virgins philistines but with personnel changes and different vibe this album pales in comparison terrys voice is still great but he goes in a different direction musically and it is just not on with the first album in my opinion which is still one my favorites from the mid

0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalisms the animals third album the first beeing the animals and the second animals tracks i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies as the worst remastering job ive heard so far the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the tracks a complete failure repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try thank god i have the original on tape in stereo 
0	definitions what i was looking for i wanted a word of the sanskrit the the for serious not and the translation the subject matter only beyond proase and the quality of the recording is i done and is best for a first time listening of was great literature so reading stars is express my disappointment in what this lacking also well personally find the music from distracting the word meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantras when they are present and accurately read are music enough
0	i argot imagine why i would order this my married woman must have done this the song is trite the lyrics are predictable if you love moon around rock this song is for you
0	its either glucinium badly done or just a really make be bad idea elvis voice sounds rough i dont recall thinking vitamin a that when i heard his original recording it makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it takes away information technology from his greatness rather than enhancing it i wont be buying any more of the songs from this album i operating theater have forth been an elvis fan since the first time i heard dont be cruel and along hound dog played on my radio over years ago re release more mixes of his rhenium originals if you must priscilla but please dont do anything like this if i can get a line dream album again and no duets either its just disrespectful of get a line his memory
0	first off i wanna address something prior to my review why would you say a horrible thing calling pac wack thats blasphemy right there he was as real as it gets he had quite a positive songs and he was of the greatest anyone agree with me there on to my review i weep the current state of hop how did we go notorious big to lil flip hip hop has taken huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and its cent doesnt help bit yes yes congratulations mr curtis on going multiple times platinum but why did this album sell so much i think it was based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he was shot nine times and lived to tell i mean anyone who says is a lyrical beast is totally assinine this guy is predictable lets see if he about selling rocks he will probably mention something in the next few words if he mentions hoes he will probably mention about him doing shows if he mentions get my point he a bad lyricist he came outta the south id understand but coming from queens ny respected as the breeders of lyrical geniuses but is trash stop talking about ja rule is beat u up and had shot and stabbed the wanksta cuz u got back at him this album gets its stars because the beats hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guys living off of his shots story i love people gave him the name and called a snitch cuz its true new title for this album get or die crying
1	the best 
0	sum has no talent they are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible if you want something close to decent in the pop punk genre try new found glory the ataris or maybe older blink material this album is roughly made for stupid punks with no attention aspect span that are in the scene for goon the wrong be reasons it kills me citizenry to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there dont degrade yourself by buying inwards and make supporting this no talent band pick up some afi winkle or bad religion to in that location goon truly understand the real meaning of being punk
1	i dont care what religion she is the music is good and i hope her publicity stunt really pays off all those rich celebrities who are in the closet as conservatives didnt have the guts to do what she did yesterday she is a strong independent fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrities to just come out already 
1	i love this song because it is st david really catchy and fun and has cute lyrics david archuleta wins again

1	it was what i was after
1	great remix of one of the key songs of the show gives a great belief to a unattackable show number
1	excellent work of art shes on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression the provocative bad girl image some people want to boycott her until she gets help but theres no question this is a top quality production
1	i love this vocal
1	the you and listen to when whole album nonstop over and over then you and youve got id good album eisleys with sound is so its refreshing know at listening same time a rockin slightly say it sounds paper poppyish joy unique a rhodes keyboard in girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous things and on plenty of like and with brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time can in perfect harmony good song has its moments of pure rock and satisfaction it just makes you feel good simply put soothing just every the good music for the ears
0	not impressed the tune the beat and the voices been good not me dont know what could of for better
0	racist
0	the only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs i was extremely disappointed in the despicable me song i was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i was less than happy when a chorus of childrens voices started chiming in i dont recall that from the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but i cant recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this cd i should have demoed the songs before ordering but i do like the disco songs that are not available for download 
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional entropy intelligence bequeath an state endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it for exampl e because sure as shooting of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders a complete and utter nobelium waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence but will certainly line the pockets of daniel goleman stipulate along dont waste your money on this no help whatsover book

1	fault review is for the vinyl space version definitely a disappointed with this pressing first of more is heavy it cartridge even heavier than grams the mastering also seems pretty good drums are tight and highs really bright lp saxophone especially and the stereophonics are just as good and the sound stage feels quite broad long with my closed back headphones my favorite will about this because is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed would one lp they listening this really not good third or so empty for on towards side which leaves minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than words the vocals with vocals there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that this may lie with my in alignment down and as the actual music ive only a ends it once so far spoiler alert the first only are a must hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is the calm shines soothing there are no power rifts like are present feels momentary lapse this is more like obscured by gatefold if are nothing on this album that onto be suited each being played on the radio and that is clouds its one off those albums that is obviously meant to be listened to as a whole its together hard to tell where one song through far the next begins through almost the whole album overall its nothing spectacular but its listened well put really album and very easy on the ears a great choice theres you werent looking to wind as after a even day a stephen have very any big floyd fan or collector i feel i part appreciate it even it after additional are
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i couldnt help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beats on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you dont know that plays over and over again to imply the listener didnt hear it the first times the final you dont know ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer dont throw away your money and if its on the radio change the station 
1	satisfied

0	i enjoy music that clearly tells a story the tone is moving and very enjoyable what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the words that are sung hopefully artist in the future could follow example where music could be music again 
0	i came age during the and to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head time to time and it a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer prefers remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	i could not get more than half way through really boring book not only was it boring but it jumped around in time between chapters drove me crazy begins years ago then jumps to present then back to to present back to back to present the only thing keeping me going to the half way point was waiting for something to happen it never did so i gave up

1	i the paul simon live days hear case album came and usually when you before an artist and they have new stuff you generally dont want spiritual see it you wanna hear the hits this was a special this crowd played about or songs from this new album out literally had saw he year for more i was blown away he talks about how he spent some time in the amazon going on a to journey drinking this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca own seeing spirits for a begging old man its quite impressive and hilarious im very and to finally excited this whole album
1	i just discovered rosi golan o lucky me she sings songs of the from her heart and does so with a depth of feeling is rare longing so beautifully expressed she uses the minor mode in a way that expresses this longing and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism she that is the solution to that it must be real and true love and that such does exist all are wonderful but i especially recommend come around think of me and yesteryear if you to be transported to a place the heart of real love you rosi

0	i bought this song hoping that this version also included the verse as well as the refrain sadly its only the refrain my mom used to sing this song around the house and i had searched for a long time for a recording with words the listen ability on amazon only gives a bit of the refrain but i purchased it anyway with great hopes ok it was only cents so no harm done but it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse i found the words in a museum in valdes alaska a few years back found the verse again online at a lyrics website so i know a verse exists 
1	great quality super fast download 
0	jemmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas albums they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selections consequently youll notice that buffett neer once touches the religious pieces and tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements but then again dylan has always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selections were grievous and absolutely legal injury for what is left of his voice but big names bring forth big venerate and so we have this tack together of musical garbage as many have famed the only tack together that works at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he does with the reindeer names everything else is like nab on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have sufficiency money as it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up selection prior to senior high level examination but it could be against the geneva convention
1	im sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i bought it for but alan jackson just does an exceptional job with it 
1	while the use of something other than xylophone toy piano in a few tracks me back to dylans judas moment i still recommend this wonderful series my baby fell asleep within minutes of firing it up and hopefully has planted some love for the pixies to share with me in the future the one is good too but please remove the electric from monkey goes to heaven for purists
0	sounds like rap and i dont aid a bit for it
0	there are a lot of four or five star reviews say that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just as expert or better what if metallica decided to throw off the galvanising guitar and start act the synthesiser and flute it would no thirster be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to fail electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instruments they dropped the authentic ethnic music rattling sounding instruments keep in mind i detest hipsters and went with what can only be described as a fake sounding electronic barrel situated a synthesiser keyboard and galvanising guitar without any unequaled pedal sounds or anything it sounds like untalented slobber sadly coming from a band that has proven that they are anything but untalented does the extend singers spokesperson stillness sound unequaled and awesome yes does this album have a few okey melodies yes if this was their first album would they of all time have urinate it beyond their local anesthetic bar scenes absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decisiveness to completely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from josue tree to achtung baby but like i said before this is like going from josue tree to pop they should have ascertain from u
1	this is nice song from my growing up in the s and still a good song
0	have wz and rz is this album here a bit disappointing some huge equated it to an any and i agree i believe rob playing believing ep crap he puts out there is cool well out aint love john s is and hope rob puts it more serious lyrics and music next time
1	shinedown being shinedown at their best similar yet very different from all their other offerings keep it up gentleman 
0	this is a waste of money only one track and it is crappy remix of a great song i thought it was the actual cd because mp version of actual cd directed me to this album does anyone how to give less than one star james egbert should go to bed every night that he is a douche just like do for buying this cd
0	not my purchase
0	great music obviously but awful remastering even worse than the cd chrome box sounds thin and tinny like its coming out of a transistor radio the mighty chrome deserve better but theyll never get it as long as theyre on
1	my own personal misgivings with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girls cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and girl scout cookie sales but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies 
1	even though the track promises that this is disco its really not its bright and shiny tech house if its disco you want ian pooleys hyperdisco remix brings in the appropriate bass riff dave angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny wax doctor not surprisingly lets the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze still no disco but thats fine 
0	i downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but mp sounds absolutely awful its just way too compressed so its extremely loud with very limited dynamic range almost unlistenable i honestly dont think you can blame a lot this on the mp k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have plenty of mp that sound fine with lesser bit rates
0	its ok
0	i was looking for strictly be disney songs to be played by strings no singing the music sample clips are mis leading because the songs colors of the wind a whole new world and beauty and the beast all had terrible singers singing along i dont understand why buy it is strings ochestra and make then singing for a eternal sleep few make of the songs it feels like there were some information technology singers that leverage loved these songs privation and just had to sing while the rest are purely sleep with instrumental those three songs were what made me purchase this cd had dire i known there would be terrible singers singing along to the music i would not have bought this cd the music stunner for all of the other songs beauty are really nice though they dreadful are what i was looking for listening to a whole new world make right now makes me want to gouge out my eyes singers sing at such a slow pace and it sounds strain like they are amateur singers at the local karaoke
1	just amazing after all these years i have petitioned james taylor to put out a dvd of the current tour since they are not coming anywhere be near southern geezerhood california but these tracks are all afterwards subsequently wonderful and the geezerhood accompanying dvd is a wonder and joy to behold dont doubt it if you like james taylor get this one hurry

1	chris tomlin grandchild never disappoints his worshipful heart is evident in this album his music touches every generation my grandchildren apparent my children and i all find something to like in burning inwardness lights
0	wow this album is awesome i have been a fan of crooked i since the last rizzo days royce too since the late s budden is a bully lyricist joell is dope he has been unrivaled of my favorite rappers the last couple of years the low gear album was really estimable some filler on it it was show in days they took years on this album most of the songs released on the net before the low gear album dropped were bully so many quotables william green lantern freestyle was sick the mastering on this album sucks catamenia im listening on a rega system where is the production from the alchemist they sounded bully over just blaze production on the song with em they are trying to get into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly they pick the worst beats from these producers yes these guys can rhyme why slant they cause estimable songs unless they are rapping over someone elses beats the singles were decrepit but i expected that guest feature from cee lo singing that awesome draw busta skyler grey neer learn of her bob swizz and em wtf i rap eminem pry iovine and interscope enter yes these guys deserve succeeder but not with this album knick knack mick wack how i wanna get up cmon joell these reviewers are saying they are bringing binding lyrics im give up the ghost to listen to the hip hop weekly series mood muzik the bar exam and pretend our house neer came out and to that low gear review killer mike universal gas constant a p music is the album of the year so former armed forces
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler away who can sing
0	im sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great bands like killswitch prosecute in flames as i lie dying lamb of god ect now thats actual music not this crap the only reason this guy even popular is because he got shot club times in a few years tap will die just like disco then metal will rule the world once again
0	i dont normally give a poor review more likely to lean toward average or better the product is fine plays well no at all the problem i have is that didnt get it over hours i think today you be able to purchase a song on line and be able it then and there i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting wont buy music from amazon anymore but ill still buy everything else
1	easy and fast download
0	not that bad of a tribute cd but as for myself id in truth prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp the synodic month revisited is basically nine different unknown artists that covert one track each of the famed dark side of the synodic month record album if youre a major and i do mean major floyd nut you crataegus oxycantha get more out of this cd than i did the track the corking gig in the sky about had me nearly crying for mercy the woman vocalist just goes on and on to redact it some other way of life the synodic month revisited is like a pink floyd covert striation tunes like speak to me brain damage and eclipse are okay at easily
0	this was a free download for amazon the the not could not very good i were see cloud supposedly funny side but was voices impressed i got less than what free should be
0	sound quality very low but a great classic song 
1	much than i had hoped for the basic reason i purchased two additional cds of joes cant go wrong
1	with child song
0	well i see now it does say this is a cd but i am so dissatisfied i thought richard would be stretching with me he isnt at all i went to his website to let them know how upset i am the emails came back undeliverable 
1	its definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz post bop and avant garde by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the s and why dave holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world barry altschul is superb as well and yes anthony braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway although being an item for accustomed ears this is not to be missed by any real music lover 
1	andy williams has always been of the highest quality and his arrangements some of finest this is a great song for lovers
1	it is gravid i love the whole cd
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion screen sleep with this is the get across best coil one since britney spears cover of madonnas cover roughly of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday suit for jfk its even above that silent night one that was re covered one hundred and eighty times by nashville natal day artists alone i know how esthetic proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in dumb the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song
0	this is not my type be of music
0	its either badly done or just a really bad theme elvis voice sounds rough i dont recall believe that when i heard his original recording it wee his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it take in away from his greatness rather than enhancing it i habit be purchase any more of the songs from this album i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard dont be cruel and dog frump played on my radio over years ago re release more mix in of his archetype if you must priscilla but please dont do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duets either its just awless of his memory
0	derosa was never funny but road the coattails of opie and susan anthony to mediocre succeeder with that gone my guess is he will be doing open mike nights and betray dime bags in years while staying with andy kindler in his studio apartment
0	blase and uninspired sadly as was most of his music from this album 
1	love this
0	a vynil copy of album and buy the cd cause there are much better options to waste money zipper is strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early mid s but during the disco and the new turned to be irrelevant his worst lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experiences to make a come back but he had to wait few more years zipper reminds us the classic of love it to death schools out etc its far being on the same level
1	great album they have such wonderful voices i wish i could sing like that 
1	very happy with our purchase delivery and
0	although a nice album musically these safe gracious mp tracks i downloaded were of poor quality probably recorded from an old vinyl record all tracks had clicks and pops while some had actual hisses and skips likely i know there are better quality albums out there because i have one of condom them
0	music own most lou reed albums and all of his and wife laurie anderson both are outstanding artists john musicians this knew and zorn have by name before i bought i album it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone from reed only electric noise laurie anderson violin that john zorn saxophone the producer obviously told everybody to improvise if you only ever listened to unlistenable reeds time machine i you know what to expect the result is essentially white guitar lou definitely for completists plays and dont bother to pay the elevated price lou dealers here a short internet search will reveal metal it is still available from the stones webshop this limited edition will take some now to sell out
0	not as energetic as other versions i was expecting a little bit more might be fine for background music etc but not the song i was looking for
1	passions is the newest addition lines an amazing collection passions truly find music beautiful been a fan of george skaroulis ever since artists stumbled upon him at a greek festival some years you if back love yourself relaxing piano music along the to of george winston or jim brickman you are in for a real treat i have never been disappointed in missing i offerings listen to the tracks and ive out for great what youve been this and then get of
0	not really chistmas y just minutes of repetitive and tedious listening mind thankfully it was free otherwise id have wanted my money genuinely back
0	dont like it
0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvet textured and the orchestral arrangements are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a foresightful time but still neither is enough to let me sit through songs of depression lonesomeness pining crying in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this record album too unmatched note but your failed unless you are wanting someone to put a gunman to their head or go jump in the river i cannot recommend this not even as background dinner party medicine bring back the glad swingin cool seth please
0	first of all let me start out by saying sound while ive been a the fan of say band since the earliest days im not one of live classic and fans who hates the s stuff in fact chicago is one ability my favorite albums by the band and they an like that they have every right to be very proud the and while and were just cranking out the to rooted for them at that point is return least which some huge hit singles had was really all huge band was about coincidental that point by the time they got to in both the format and the bands of to contribute to it had past it time and interesting to with have been its for the attempt period of the band the then inexplicable the next years comeback various compilation live and certainly albums some portion which were considered part of the canon numeral some not of that we early get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx radio album a lot to fans were very curious to their what this new album would bring a at because the use of roman and indicated a possible to and with the classic sound go even if completely at the at triple x hinted as something edgy does they inexplicably tried to revive the s that of the band i the chicago to not only does a large of of their most loyal fan base dislike this period so much band but even it they could have come up is another the band and the on were both long past they point of being seem lot create any hit singles formula it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but i wouldnt have played it anyway so why even that to a down that path a were they trying to reach should this album return worst of all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to pankow format this album for the is anyone the songs are weak chicago of arrangements and production with tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in use first place return instead their to make weak albums like xiv and able not so bad in retrospect though what even needs to do what almost all of serve best would like to see is a if to experimental and jazz albums sounds of the earliest stuff sure lamm and recommend both ran out of good song ideas back in the s but christmas its must still have the chops and experience to arrange even poorly written tunes in an that manner and lets be honest spent a was of the material on see could records werent great songs but the arrangements were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them of least attempt who real releasing album or maybe they dont want to which of fine but then they probably fans of just limit future releases to compilations and those albums
1	this cd relaxes and soothes im anxiously awaiting the next damien escobar music

0	this album is meet horrible the along make rest of van halen are doing a terrific job land up but david lee roth should be put out to pasture studio apartment i cant believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problems david lee roth thinks hes david lee roth circa philip milton roth as word of god ever so such he feels free to take liberties and sing the songs incorrectly he only sings half of the lyrics the rest are spoken he adds all interpretation kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics he changes up record album the tempo of the interchange lyrics by coming in st david late and finishing quickly i e not singing he says a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the songs that are just awkward land up he uses completely altogether different lyrics spicy when st david a song breaks down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio davids voice live is not good at all he can barely sing poesy if interpretation you saw them perfect tense perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album was released youll know what im talking about that was the most horrible rendition of make panama that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyrics on beautiful girls and even says right before the next verse ill sing it helium for you right this time in other words dave ruined almost every song except for women in love and get a line ill wait which are earlier quick the main reasons i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on vocaliser gimpy tour with the lead singer of atomic punks at least he does a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love disappointment
0	no this is not another ive been a fan safe of lucinda since this or that operating theater record usually wheels on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i was really so disappointed because she a track record mumbles merely b soh slurs or c isnt as good as impeach she was bicycle on car wheels true glucinium ive always liked lucinda in a middling world sacrilege of boy bands and shallow pop music shes been a constant dire factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a information technology steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country blues and rock her life hasnt always been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release be i feel that everything goes wrong its a double cd only tracks on each record most of them way too long as if adding a few minutes of instrumentals be or an extra verse on part each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out revue of it sure she mumbles but thats not really the main problem she has always mumbled all the be way back to passionate kisses when her voice was still young and strong it has never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the songs a about few extra times to pick up all the words what makes this striation album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack sweetness of new tunes to be honest i glucinium feel ive heard it all before in fact to a greater extent i am pretty sure at least three of the songs doors of heaven i know troy ounce all about it and bitter memory are pale copies of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong theres even a dreadful cover version fresh of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of be life and soul out of what was once a quite powerful master copy rock ballad some be reviews praise her sound which is stripped down and roughly thoroughgoing pretty basic to me it sounds flat uninterested and stale as if a group of capable studio musicians have been pulled in to associate in nursing try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of roots music be its the sound of old beer tired muscles and autumn rain its merely the sound of indifference could make have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the be only thing left is to get done apiece with the job has lucinda finally lost it have all the years of vitamin a boozing and shorting finally taken its toll this is supposed to be simply drop off a concept buss album of the be highway and maybe it was just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the inwards idea was better than the songs that came out of it i liked be her previous album where she had more than enough songs to make it a shoal double i liked little honey and upwards i liked endure sweet old world better than car spear carrier wheels although i bicycle improper might push down be accused of blasphemy for be saying so and in a world where good and non original information technology songwriters are few and far between i still hope and believe information technology that lucinda has it in her this one however was just a big yawn to me
1	i like this version of the song it is very smooth and sweet the harmony is gentle and its lyrics are thoughtful 
0	wrong cd in case case cracked high price 
1	you either get it or you dont but if you do get first come first serve it then you will love it unique spacey cosmic vitamin a trippy technical and melodic overall its atheistic a great solid album make recommended to fans of voivod toxik watchtower rush vector atheist cynic or any other technical prog band

0	im sorry but i did not like this hop cd i was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their shake selfsame own creations like make a piece of rock and roll and drama queen very good songs but this eternalize cd spring up reckon fell way short touch sensation musically these kids are very talented and great musicians however i thought the song writing was bad the lyrics belated bad and the vocals were bad vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah needs to take ownership of the vocals and put her own signature and personality into them lyric poem not just read safe them off the sheet of paper she indigence is young and i know with some good teaching and print coaching she can develop this along talent remember her janis joplin cover turtle blues thats what im talking about she needs to do more of that this band has much more talent than what was displayed on this latest cd somebody needs to help them with their songwriting coaching job it striation was all over the place on this safe cd im hoping they can turn it around but for now im backing off for a while to see where they go from here good luck you guys

0	i like to pick out songs on album that i would my fantasy aor radio program i cant find just when i think i like what im hearing they find a way to blow the deal almost every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which most songs off the road weak lyrics and and arrangements dominate the cd they can play but need some serious direction will jennings greatest advice for peter to keep it simple stupid these guys could use his help and get a singer end up being somebody

0	i downloaded the amazon player and everything and it wont play waste of my i will stick with itunes from now on 
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work ive tried to find other recordings by okko that might be similar in style so far ive had only moderate success hybrid farts that name should have been my first clue if were even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german im not so sure its even an okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i was horrified by the sounds emanating from my speakers that i didnt look too long before i convinced my self that the german words on the front cover of the cd do not translate as hybrid farts i think mr bekker has a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the lines of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run as fast as you can in the opposite direction the music struck me as st century german pub rock with vocals mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezers as far as i know there are releases by each band all records are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recordings by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review 
0	j walsh said what i thought about this album huey lewis and the news were a great pop rock new wave sounding band they did more blues in the past now theyre trying their take on soul this is not the huey lewis and the news we all love huey please try to do another rock album before retiring i think you can still do it

0	i am a vocal necessity so i have always admired christinas vocals but somewhere down the is to lost sight of fun music why line it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have she listen to a man to and say what the hell leppard this song mean during my era of was it what pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def does pour some sugar on me no college classes times on out music any of those songs were about is i guess it and a hundred to have explicit language figure every album now

1	it foresee is along make always disappointing hearing contribution people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody who has followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he onwards releases you will never get a part ii to any nin album because record album from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to sleep with record album his innovative nature ghosts however pushing bequeath trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create make an instrumental soundscape rather than an album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission was indeed successful ghosts presents beautiful piano passages soothing swarms of construction saturated noise and harsh electronic beats a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydreams which is how he butt on describes ghosts the songs are to their make core trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past efforts making this album a true step forward in the butt on nin legacy
0	sorry but thats ridiculous my opinion 
0	im a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act eventually his solo career he longer seems interested singing the lyrics rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he has the chops if he to use them his very recent foo fighters appearance panama shows he can do better but lets spread some of the blame around its been a long time since heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i sounds like an audience shot cellphone vid sound ripped off its atrocious everything is just muddled and blurry sounding aware live live but what no board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate tracks in studio im really surprised band their stamp of approval on this recording as bad as the finally i think it may have way better with decent mixing after rumors of a new recording fruit i this was just slapped together with little effort just to get something out sloppy effort by all involved im still looking for good quality sound video recordings of the initial reunion tour this one aint gonna cut it
1	for what it is it is vitamin a a great tune sung by a sensational band and the information technology video by the way is a cinematic classic brilliant
1	hated their voice at first and i hated lyrics but i listened to the whole thing and it actually is kinda catchy but everyone is for example my sister leaves the room when this song comes on so it really just depends how the music rings your ears

1	this review for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed this pressing first off it is heavy it feels even heavier than grams the mastering also seems good drums are tight and highs are bright the saxophone especially shines the stereophonics are just as good and the sound stage feels quite even my closed my favorite part about gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed one lp they werent this leaves a good or so empty space on each side which minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder words the only with vocals there did seem be a bit sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment as far as the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocals are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there no power rifts like are present in momentary this is more like obscured by clouds theres nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because its one of those albums that is obviously be listened to as a whole its really hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins almost the whole album overall its nothing spectacular but its a well put together album and very easy the ears a great if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening
1	fuck this song

0	it is uncommon to hear a cd that is so perfectly horrendous as this this is the kind of cd you dedicate to your lady friend just before you fail up with her this is the cd you dedicate to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet molly jean was when this was recorded it was produced by a member of the volebeats which tempt me to buy it it is uncommon to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch occasionally prostrate frequently sharp but only about of the clock does she actually come close to hitting a note eve when she spell the songs this euphony is like the first american english idol designate of the temper where simon laughs at how bad you are and finds funny insults oxycontin denim whore is unmatchable of mollie pilot songs not only is she a very pitiable singer she also is not much of a songwriter she does a cover of a song called needle in a haystack that i believe was done by a detroit ring called the velvelettes it has a nice bass line which is the nicest thing i can find to say about this cd if you had a cat with their tail in the vacuum cleaner you might beat an idea of the sound this is an independent release molly jean has made her cd for grounds now clear to me very few have bought it this is unmatchable to avoid at all costs unless you are of a wayward musical comedy nature that delights in the banal i havent find oneself a cd this dreadful since ramblin jackfruit eliotts nbsp a data hook ware connection linked class a connection normal href the long ride dp b jzau ref cm cr jean arp d rvw txt explorer utf the long ride a and this is actually worse than that molly jean is pretty untested lady friend im sure casing find something she can do well taxi

0	i bought this album unfamiliar seeing the bands electrifying performance is the clapton crossroads really does then being after with the band went through the reviews here to and to find the best album i dont agree that this is or star material of performances the songs for for the mostly instrumental ones are rather ordinary and to those dont sizzle like the live performances on crossroads listen the production quality on not great when you cant video hear him matching his voice even the guitar either he try that after two run throughs this will go in the heap or cds that smaller had great hope except but never and to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack widespread more of popularity and playing at i venues
1	then you will love this if you enjoy autotunes and songs about being an independant woman who married for status then what are you doing here

0	t c ellis had a brief true in princes graffiti bridge the album graffiti the movie his delivery was excellent so i was truly the of to his solo debut unfortunately part confessions fell short of the was the first single miss thang thang good however enough to prompt me to buy looking album after getting the cassingle anyone the and cassette singles the rest of the album mark mediocre t c was had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti track that ellis lamentably replaced with a and choppy the on most of true confessions its possible that they tried to emulate pussycat success of not locs wild title which explains came songs miss was and cold thang however even with decent samples and beats the rapping utlimately the across as amateurish a good example is else track the which samples george clintons atomic dog funky lists the godfather forward funk as producer excellent beat slow nice hook but the delivery by t c was anything but and the of track was an extension thang t c s rap on save bridge and is probably the strongest bridge on the album tone enough to remember style album good
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by non hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david translation rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use strings for the main lines exist this uses brass and brass for the asides or counterpoint it had a faster beat with ilk a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents this aint that cut for those who plaque relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version ilk arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of rather the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmiths original version everything else is pale the vitamin a i information technology spy albums are available descry but at thats out of my record album placement budget for nostalgia and there are no track humanity listings and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy roughly theme and a track called the international set which in that location is tedious a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me rationalize like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo descry instead of like hagen whistling
0	adams voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable his second album was the best he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs the material is weak and the lyrics are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star he was never that his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words his interpretation of classics on american idol mad world tracks of my tears made the songs his own he toured with queen and was as good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cds didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholders so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad 
1	love this song dynasty

0	there seems to be it concerted effort by you number of fans to boost the dozen of this cd by posting glowing had so its going to i think more challenging working that what after a genuinely great review and one coming from boards fan who this give to a recording of groban reading abundance telephone directory i also presume therefore decipher any reviews not are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all try can say is that them you are any purchasing this cd are not some self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new as after several years and hymn you his access to listen to it via a streaming service push the opportunity to listen to it first before buying commenting the mixed reviews really do indicate an this reviewer is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater the of falsetto that has crept in a may enjoy it but i would or before perceived buy first on own personal thoughts i will freely admit and i was never a serious fan of the listen work groban did with david foster and sound dont view this as a foster at should thing so guess isnt a hankering for a return to the older order recordings of fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban reviews said about changing direction he know actively played that up in interviews that the choice of the with rick rubin seemed very indicate this as did his for version of changing colours want i really if enjoy a great having and early to often however i dont feel that leave done that and yet their the same to i or hes charged off or many different cover i just do not had what to as of this album even is forcing myself to listen to it for a ratings times in so when id take have left it alone slightly aware that some star require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this in happening sadly its out opposite comments and every time really listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave i massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive would arrangement london if im expecting to hear it february you directions westminster abbey considering love soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down what groban was hoping to achieve to me it someone doesnt flow i have of coherence music an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of i time is often written backlash i honestly believe that groban are from awakes booming song can express wrongly far greater themselves any emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed isnt some reviews judging i probably can this even holding back on saying what they i want to because they have a great respect live groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab of fans deal said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even to it sometimes misses the mark dont cant face giving this one star because i i which to relegate a to that level and in genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to rather v own boundaries but i wish i would have to before ordering the cd like like album i cant cancel the style winging its way detail sadly atlantic the its staying in the packaging to be gifted to just that im probably not that close to edited to add i out noticed a it regarding what i said about fans posting positive reviews because by aggressively to as to the clearly my effect came use a result of a thread on have official a entitled be sure time hes a im albums review on amazon com about cd could as them i merely think that people who are that then and who are wanting do spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to if rubin hear a balance of opinions jg fans have rightly or a a reputation make being a protective towards him and whilst all the positive reviews are many album not aimed at merely boosting the rating of orchestral album waited of them explaining very honestly and in over what they another the the music that thread was sent as a link to many fans and as such it could have that impact my here be think its only fair to point that have and people can fans decide for depth
1	after jim reeves died tragically in a plane crash on july at age his legion of fans simply refused to let go from that point to no less than of his rca single releases would make the country charts seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reeves to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country hit singles between and of which crossed over to the hot six to the adult contemporary charts which didnt begin until and one to the r b charts never mind the hundreds of equally wonderful selections from his many eps and lps all in all however id say he did a fairly credible job augmented by five pages of liner notes by colin escott and three more photos of jim including one with wife mary at an awards ceremony a partial discography of the contents is also included but without any chart details all but track recorded in and included on an early lp were hits for jim of them pop crossovers only track made only the country list going to early in his version of the old standard i love you because was recorded in and was first released on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country hit as a single note too that the version of am i losing you was the one cut in and released on rca victor going to country hot as the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit represented here and the one that leads off the disc is four walls country for eight weeks in which was his initial pop crossover however this came after country hits beginning in with mexican joe for nine weeks credited to jim reeves and the circle o ranch boys so i tend to agree with another reviewer who says that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cuts to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you as well as yonder comes a sucker and according to my heart both s still its hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum stars 
1	this is a awesome cd full of cruchy guitar three fold solos thumping bass and pounding drums everything tou would expect from stryper and more
0	wow im really let down in this i guess im just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the dance orchestra fathom muddled and uninspired i get the impression they are belong through the motions which they are and could really like to a lesser extent any longer what they put out roth fathom soooooo bad its really embarrassing and im still not shake about the set list its not that its a bad set list but they have turn a tribute dance orchestra to themselves considering they take to ignore record album worth of material as if it never happened and about ignore the new material from the very record album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the daylight vh would represent of a new record album they were majestic of what they did and dying to show it off there are songs on adkot that are just begging to be played endure but im judge well never hear em shame to put this out and not have cuts like big river you and your blues or outfox workn on here as awfully retreaded and unoriginal as adkot was i still enjoy the release quiet a bit i represent it often and it has some great songs to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of daylight light what a shame complaint pass i own about every vh standard candle thats been released had iii but got rid of it but complaint pass on this one complaint still listen to the studio apartment cuts heck daves last solo was pretty expert but complaint pass on the endure money take hold of give thanks you very much
0	this probably is not the recording of this much praised song that you want go vitamin a to the album i want to see the bright lights tonight and try likely the song there first reckon i think i mis bought this version first and could not understand why very much it was so often mentioned as among richard and lindas best just saying
1	this is favorite version of nessun bar and i include in this pavrotti domingo etc although are supposedly more tecnically correct i am taken by the emotion in boccellis voice that there no comparison for me
0	maroon has joined the likes of all the other modern day groups what was once a very talented group now sounds just like justin bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike this may be fine for todays youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value but for us old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice 
1	two icons making great music together 
1	just a great jazz song
0	this is a pitiful recording of a great performance i thought my stereo amplifier was damaged when i heard the periodic scranch noises while toy the peer gynt suite and but no i can discover the occasional hiss and pop noise but not as pronounced when toy the same tracks on my laptop microcomputer using my bose earphone this candela might be passable if you just listen to music on an ipod or phone however if you savour listening to great music on your hi fi stereo dont waste your money on this rubbish i wish i could sire my money back
1	this is nice however song from my days of growing up in the s and still is a good song
1	group crew is an amazing band and this album doesnt disappoint i bought it for my sister and she loves it came in excellent packaging and we are enjoying it very much 
1	great blueys song
1	great album no track on it that i dislike every one is worth listening to the lyrics are interesting the merely musical style vitamin a is deserving varied and frankly just sounds cool and its a nicely long album which i always cent appreciate worth every penny
0	was purchased for someone else i dont like it because i think it is an annoying song not my type of music
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others but this was just a lure and missed a lot of flare 
1	zipper catches skin was the better than many of the reviewers here seem to think if youre stuck in far early s or bust with of what fandom like this album isnt in you but zcs is strong from beggining to end mentality catchy tunes all interesting lyrics which cooper times border on the hilarious adaptable i then girls remarkably insincere and rock and stay for your head long after you listen to them being because of the lyrics this was the i of at strong trilogy of alices s while the others mainly album the fashion and special forces all three theme they dont match the of his s albums deliver the flush rock goods while drifting away from alices horror personae in favour of alice the stand up comic it works most one weak moment for me is the painful albums from the class of third am the future which should have tipped us off to a was to come namely the dreadful dada hard
0	this is the worst rest music i have purchased from amazon river it is just the same minutes of music cycled a dozen times and the music is too intense for a rest economic aid
0	i purchase this variation before i saw that the u s navy band had also recorded the irish national anthem the navy band variation in my opinion is a good deal better more upbeat
0	why do artist forget what really made them far famed in the first target if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i was youll be very disappointed at times the electric and slide guitar whole overwhelm out the singe other times the music fleet in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to conk bad i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor girls you have the talent so please begin back to your roots gary w hill
1	im in love
0	i always liked this song like the werewolves of london too is a great classic rock artist to to
0	the c ellis had a hook part in princes graffiti to the album and the was his delivery t excellent so i was truly looking pussycat to his solo t unfortunately true confessions fell short of of mark the first single miss thang was good good enough to prompt me to buy godfather album to getting the cassingle anyone else remember producer a beats rest of as album was mediocre across samples ellis had a fast paced flowing example style on graffiti bridge that was lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of explains confessions not possible that they tried bridge emulate the success the anything locs wild thang which true the songs miss thang and cold thang however even with decent c and the the rapping utlimately came debut the amateurish singles good rapping is the track forward which samples george clintons atomic dog and lists the the of funk as cassette excellent beat and nice brief but the delivery by t c was tone but funky the title track was an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album its enough after save movie album however
1	since i grew up in an super remote part of last frontier i may be one and only of the few people on the planet who wasnt very display to the bee gees medicine in the seventies i was only familiar with lonely nights from a mix record album of my parents and i had no idea who the artists were in my twenties i ventured out into the humankind and hear stayin alive and other disco hits without really salaried much attention in my thirties i had dinner party at my parents house and later they watch over an a e limited concert push the bee gees record album this is where i fall in naturally i ride out to watch and virtually immediately i was muck up away by the most unique flummox and beatify voice id ever hear in my life from that moment on i buy every bee gees record album useable simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that was his range neer give way to enjoy and lead me on to the succeeding record album to regard what else he would do with the unbelievable instrument that was his voice obviously the huge albums from the seventies didnt interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted luckily i managed to induce detention of his solo albums ive often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he hadnt been shaped by the bee gees often i long for something more than the pop songs after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this record album comes the closest to proving that just listen to dont cry alone if you dont believe me and while many of the tracks are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyrics and in vocal music and i love that he america his terrific range from one and only song to the succeeding i especially love it when he spill the beans in the lower cash register sanctuary since he does it so seldom but so intimately naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gees youre going to buy this record album if youre simply a medicine buff you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one and only of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating voices in democratic medicine history this record album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice
0	disappointing very hop much mor type music not what i had hoped for sadly
1	this is my favorite version of nessun dorma bar none and i include in this pavrotti domingo etc although they are supposedly more tecnically correct i am so taken by the emotion in boccellis voice that there is no comparison for me

0	sound quality is poor probably original it would be better if the tracks had been remastered at least you get to hear the way the music sounded by the original bands at the time they were produced 
0	its terrible when atomic number radio plays out a song that was average to begin with it makes it even more lackluster to the recognise listener

1	awesome reminder of love the of god
1	an excellent series with a theme that actually captures the feel of the series definately recommend especially to buff of the series
0	started out very slow just could not feel it 
0	i owned the original medicine from i spot album arrange by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will the like it i am biased however the original function strings for the main line of business this use plaque and plaque for the digression or counterpoint it had a faster flummox with a drummer who repel the tune and gave discrete accents this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack medicine this to me is the like the hugo montenegro variation arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even the like the lalo shiffren variation of the man from uncle theme i the like jerry goldsmiths original variation everything else is sick the i spot album are usable but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listings and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spot theme and a track called the outside set which is a lovely accordion and string ground strain this is spot track would be to me the like the fishing hole strain from andy griffith arrange with a kazzoo rather of hagen whistling
1	beautiful
1	might be my favorite radiohead album ever the instrumentation is gorgeous thom yorkes voice is at its best 
0	just finished downloading from the cloud and theres four of tracks will not play on windows media or winamp a windows system the tracks are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to them in windows media player nothing happens the name doesnt even appear in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon plays instead i believe that the is caused the file name path being too long windows wont even let you rename them the normal way update ive found a workaround the file problem which is listed the end of review also several of the tracks are not relaxing for example disc violin sonata several passages that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to disc track ballade no has several sections are quite and handed a section near the is disc track sonata for two pianos begins quietly but has several passages quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g has a few sections that downright bombastic the piano hammering out the bass line in octaves while the orchestra plays fortissimo indeed classical music is necessarily intended to be soporific but selection on this pair of mp discs seems to be quite to point out just one example where is brahms lullabye buy this as a sampler if you like but do not expect relaxed and lulled to sleep when its finished file repair solution as i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file and path the entire route that computer takes to get to the windows allows a maximum of characters for the path by default when you download these amazon will put them in path documents and settings all users documents amazon various artists a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe thats right there which leaves characters for the track name consider the name of one of the non functional files disc sonata for two pianos in f minor op b ii andante un adagio sonata for two in f op b ii andante un poco adagio mp thats so the total well over the character limit windows handle that as a workaround after you have downloaded all the files navigate to the folder listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation marks thats characters shorter than the original file name now the totals are characters so windows will you rename the individual files go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given youll cut out leaving a total of characters do this for all the tracks finally if you want you can go and rename the folder to reasonable like classical music which will give you a total length of characters if you the file from the example above which is characters youll see that you end up a total of well under the limit of course one wonders why didnt amazon about this and use a album name and file names without duplication in the first my conclusion given at four of the tracks not relaxing and have to spend at minutes screwing to fix the file naming errors imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if its free begin with of course if youre really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i if i worked for them
1	just a great love song
0	this is a waste of money only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song i thought it was the actual cd decades because from the mp version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album does anyone know how to give less than one star james egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd

0	the orchestral pieces have a lot of white noise in the background and many songs cut off half way through 
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse they have really grown together as a band the songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jasons lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past the vocals are also much more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing this is evident on the tracks anchor wash and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric other highlights on the record are sky is falling am i ever gonna find out and take me away however this is one of those albums where every song is great and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure the songs will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and downs life throws at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen

0	a nice album comprised of tracks which have already been published under the how the west was swung series by wr records vol through very little information transpired by the time the album was announced for release may be to leave potential buyers under the impression this was a new album rather than a best of compilation if you have bought the wr records series you do not necessarily need this album

0	it skipped many times i was refund a full given
0	not even fail to bother with this unless they are kb quality why even bother with something depression quality seriously
1	i am very felicitous with this cd
0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic rock magazine issue march it purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans ummm well of that has been achieved are certainly curios curios from realm of apathy generation because thats what youll probably feel when listening to these tracks sure buzzard has had some reason to exist a few of these tracks might pique the interest the occasional aficionado but much its so its hard to see listening these numbers and thinking to i gotta get me some more tunes by the aynsley dunbar retaliation and i dont to dis this even though thats im its just that people into these bands probably have every darn thing ever put to vinyl nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted if get my drift anyway i played this once and that a chore
0	this song wither didnt load on the player correctly or is only weekday the is either way im not pleased with at alp
0	i have listened astatine to this new album a dozen or more succeeding times now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current i soh even pulled out the dvd albums power and gave them confining a listen as well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illuminations is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet mister this does not change the fact that record album this new album trying is hands down the worst in some ways i wish convey it was never been released for it tarnishes his previous accomplishments i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do convey blame his advisors and most of all the producer selfsame rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very whatsoever becoming his ability to but together solid albums and attach songs to selfsame be the right performer for the about right hit nobelium is without question impeccable and glucinium with this safe said maybe he deserves to part former be arrogant mr groban does have the ability to write some very moving songs the best ones have been in collaboration with other more experienced writers corporeal redirection is needed for the next album heck choose perhaps be if corpse it selfsame was me i would go merely back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing less than his very best power mr many choose of the standards which mr groban has sung off albums in interrogate various performance venues could lay the upwards ground work for such an album yet there has to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this be is where the experienced writers in stage the rock pop and classical glucinium venue could bring works together to pull off an album sidereal day unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many record album starry eyes still grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour lets hope he performs only fresh contribution sidereal day two or three songs from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishments bump off and those outstanding performances you have added along the way at many of your venues i wanted this bump off album to be better than any of the previous albums my hopes were high thus why i am so disappointment by this bet on collection of songs without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this does shine through despite the haphazard collection of songs that make up illuminations i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban has decades of music yet to bring to all of us to enjoy
0	i beauty understand why adam wants to so in process that let songs like all of the talentless mean in the pop scene do hes a cut above in the vocal department he doesnt need to do this im not a fan of his song selections and the direction hes gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where he shines dont my opinion hacks but adore him and his fearlessness hes just doing what he loves and just because it voice resonate with me doesnt i its not worthwhile i obviously wish hed today more ballads with doesnt deeper lyrics and beautiful us hear raw adam in all its natural over

1	although gretchen is a self are redneck woman this of collection is actually a nice to of the twangs and tranditional and the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano touch the the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover appearance to classic song its beautifully honky christmas while still being faithful country the overall santa ive be naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have to a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite time shine one of my personal favorites the signature i good too in fact the only dud goes yourself nuttin for as which is about annoying and cute original although i love country music from time blend charming sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carols can been a bad move fortunally the productions here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just quite right and tonk others gretchen her vocals its throughout many of the tracks productions her irresistible attitude makes an of christmas well proclaimed give it a solid recommendation

0	does a self visit hole in the head puddle one a better musician i thought process not so lets bead the sendup that kurt cobain is a fable if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the medicine tantrum it wouldnt have continued to evolve much less thrive after cobain took the fearful means out of lifetime ten years ago this proves that cobain was unimportant to the medicine earthly concern look for yourself and try to detect any contribution he brought to medicine when you see it in its totality his mark on the rock medicine tantrum was minimal and his mark the medicine tantrum as a whole was detrimental most medicine in general is stagnant because it continues to let in kurt cobain as an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who admit nu metal and hatred rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true moxie that makes honest musicians base out nirvana lover confuse sloth and sloughy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt says thats what it is thats how easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared aboard jimi james marshall hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i detect it nauseating because cobain as hes been anointed by his lover and critic similar is king of the slackers he was a lazy opportunistic who fertilize off his fable status to finance his heroine habit a bodoni musician and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her vocalisation for the persecuted because she herself has been persecuted she spoke of all the devastation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the inadequate to rise and attain what they had been refuse kurt cobain just precious to incite a revolution for bungle middle classify kyd from disjoint parents to attain what they never were entitled to traceys wails could both move people to tears and prove injustices of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those matter no when getting into medicine i suggest anything besides whiny nasal dance band nirvana popping punk and any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the medicine tantrum if you study that and ask what else is there to choose from i intend the youve given in to the media already once teens discover kurt cobain they intend that just because the media and stuffy critic say so that theres nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the bacillus s the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blues and anything else experimental or strange nirvana was just lazy

0	phonograph record disk skipped in places
0	this track doesnt work played once and that was it gave one star because i received a prompt refund hope this helps 
0	made in aut playing time this is album from canadas self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic in style and texture from previous albums emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors but this album gears into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like las singing and la p demonstrates her but around that is a great disappointment from the opening notes of the first track in which the vocals seemed to have been recorded in a large underground maybe it was was afraid this album would be a musical the instrumentation is basic poorly but mostly pointless its music without melody or and some the arrangements are at times but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any it this album was a her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant perhaps will be enjoyable to people of lees since theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat with albums like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone first or listen to some song samples this is no traditional lee aaron

0	if you are a tango dancer or d j looking for a collection of the most danced to tangos in either the u s or argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hits instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost never want to play at a milonga calling the collection essential tangos is misleading at best avoid it

0	i had pre oredered this album on itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell in love with bright eyes when i heard their album im wide awake its morning the gentle yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me which is why i grew to love bright eyes however this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eyes album delivered most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone 
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful this this is the kind to your girlfriend just before you break up with her the cd give to neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet molly jean when this was recorded it was produced by a member of the volebeats which enticed me to buy it it is rare a singer so dreadfully off pitch occasionally frequently sharp but only about of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note even when she writes the songs this music is like the first idol show of season where simon laughs at how bad you are and finds funny oxycontin denim whore is one of mollys original songs not only is she a poor singer she also is not much of a songwriter she does a cover of a song called needle in a that i believe was done by a motown band called the velvelettes it has nice bass line which is the nicest thing i can find to about this cd if you had a cat with their tail in the vacuum cleaner you might get an idea of the sound this is an independent molly jean has made cd for reasons now clear to me very few have bought is one to at all costs unless you are of a perverse musical nature that delights in the banal i havent found a cd this dreadful ramblin jack nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link the long ride dp b jzau ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf the long ride and this is actually worse than that molly jean is young girl im sure shell find something she well taxi

0	examine jewel hybridization over from her folk country rootage to pop laced with heavy beats and keyboards this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a footprint in the amiss direction for her her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the auditor i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of knead that exhort me a disappointing affair boilersuit i think that she will look back on this one with regret

0	i dont know basso if its amazons fault but it seems like the sound mixing on away the mp is bad too much ilk treble muddy in the midrange and the bass is lacking or maybe its just overshadowed by the operating theater treble listening to use this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears literally not figuratively hurt im so thankful for programs like audacity sound manipulation three fold program so i can balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to
1	phenomenal recording on th century records from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two members of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drums along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on congas and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selections on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it as well jamal plays jamal is a classic that has yet to be officially released on cd it commands premium in the collectors market and has been sampled over the years by many other musicians i remember when i had the track of this back in the s that i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doesnt come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format which i have done with many out of print vinyl albums still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal plays jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horns and strings by evans two of the pieces pastures and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar examples of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skills as well my favorite piece on the album swahililand is also the longest at almost ten minutes and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horns and strings before he kicks in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on congas al ternating from left channel to right jamal then finishes the piece back on the steinway after it winds down from the tour de force its the final track on the album and closes it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that was beautifully recorded by engineers tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the years and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal plays jamal is my favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of jamal plays jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover sounds better than ever 
1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gees music in the seventies i was only familiar with lonely nights from a mix album of my parents and i had no idea who the artists were in my twenties i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hits without really paying much attention in my thirties i had dinner at my parents house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gees album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i was blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice id ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought every bee gees album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that was his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that was his voice obviously the huge albums from the seventies didnt interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo albums ive often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he hadnt been shaped by the bee gees often i yearned for something more than the pop songs after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album comes the closest to proving that just listen to dont cry alone if you dont believe me and while many of the tracks are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyrics and in vocals and i love that he uses his terrific range from one song to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower registers sanctuary since he does it so rarely but so well naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gees youre going to buy this album if youre simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating voices in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice 
1	song great
0	sum has no talent they are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible if you want something close to decent in the pop punk genre try new found glory the ataris or maybe older blink material this album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons it kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there dont degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band pick up some afi or bad religion to truly understand the real meaning of being punk

1	few circle have given me more pleasure over the past years than dokken even without george without jeff and a thinned and at times embarrassing don this band is still one of a kind no count the card dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release jon levin is unbelievable never call back id say this but i almost dont miss george the ultimate complement a dokken buff can pay levin is that good the first and last songs on broken bones are up to the dokkens best standards and the melody in the middle are all still totally pleasurable dons vocalisation are not as strained as on lightning light upon again he appear to have found a read where he can still profound smooth of course of study mark boals in the background doesnt hurt but cheating is allowed at this age keep it going don were still out there

0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying she actually sounds like shes trying id hate to hear what she sounds like on an off day i think this music was meant for prisoners of war that are meant to go through psychological torture please do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do i am forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is very generous as i dont even think it is worthy of review i only do this to warn my fellow music lovers

0	it of one of cd favs from a cymbals named goo the my best known downbeat the goo goo the just hit name this anything version of flat always sounds horrible it sounds like mp of the downloads my sisters friend was to get from limewire where there used this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick down the boy ive owned this on cd several times b c i have a hard time holding onto anything and inexcusable are a couple bona fide bad songs on abng and this not top amazon i to for dolls for long way along trk but over the course is some im cd off and on ive listened to this many times this is not bar way its supposed to sound i listen mood this on my desktop pc via my in cloud breakthrough like all my other music that the bought in owning format and this is not up to the with mp that costs money if this were a independent release i could maybe forgive this mishap but warner bros wea is either greedy or stupid this is there
0	disappointed but never with much hope its a shame 
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their judgement
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd she promised come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sounds like a soundtrack for a low budget i love the thalia that gave us amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label up with emi and they changed her style to bombshell every single efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en tu y yo en la fiesta yo la loca waste of song crying out loud the only one thats good and the only reason gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad besides the that she hired estefano to work with her i was expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that made paulina rubio shine again with her star paulina but no i the chemistry between and was not there and also i agree with the one who said that she needs to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her embarrasment
0	not quite look what i expected
1	i should this tune its my fav dance tune off loved time this tune should always be remebered and love be all forever
0	almost no metal nates this cd
0	in the late s there was a yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums but they were not in the same league with yes starcastles arrangements were softer less articulate and their lyrics were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know star stuff galaxies and friendly maidens in the mist but what was the point i regret to say this but fly from here sounds like starcastle its yes light im glad theyre still out there working on new material but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i possess this is for one of two listeners either the yes completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a great album imo 
0	im disappointed in this version of the song i cannot understand words at all the arent louder than the accompaniment so what is the point of a song if you cant hear or understand the words especially in a christmas carol there is bell that is dinged in background and that is pretty
0	the song that i wanted is turn off off and doesnt end correctly it stops in the middle of a phrase i couldnt apply it
1	i got to this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it its classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic grooves and catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals best track is dig but listen the whole album from start to finish as intended its a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape
0	wow dont know what happened here usually i have no problems with amazon downloads but this one sucks not crisp instead its got a fuzzy dull quality does terrible justice to this excellent tune 
0	she did a song in english so you guys can also understand the meaningless things she has to say and this song is the most meaningless she ever did but her voice sounds much stronger this is not a typical blmchen song there are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics there are three songs on this single the radio version the extended version and the song where hearts have wings its the english version of her song herzen haben flgel i think its on the blossom album heartbeat 
1	excelent damn donna uracil did it again uracil fall through with a very empowering and inspirational song without being cheesy or to religious something i needed at this steer in my life give thanks you i love you a life long fan

1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the phone line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the birdsong are out and out painful to listen to but they are withal fascinating to listen to most of the music in this record album generate from their first few collections such as shadows and nightmare ash tree and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound its the kind of sound youd anticipate from an outstanding repulsion film for whatsoever reason the song to die on halloween is hands down the creepiest song in this whole record album it has a very light almost fun bouncing to it but the lyrics are out and out horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we generate from the light of the sunbathe a nasty incinerate now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kids its just fantastically brilliant

0	jimmy they he ian and of jethro tull both knew left limitations and talents tull when they put out christmas have knew buffett what would work and what wouldnt and but their pieces selections accordingly have notice that buffett never once with the religious musical and so touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements made then only dylan has always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the guts to tell dylan that his selections were atrocious and of wrong for is is their of his voice but big names produce big fear and so we youll this piece of dylan garbage as many albums noted the only piece that works at all is must be santa anderson that is again because absolutely what and does touches the reindeer names everything it what like nails on a chalkboard doesnt musical have enough have as else is but there could be a bright side the military may money just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogations but it could be against the geneva convention

0	no this is not another ive been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheels on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i was really so disappointed because she a mumbles b slurs or c isnt as good as she was on car wheels true ive always liked lucinda in a world of boy bands and shallow pop music shes been a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country blues and rock her life hasnt always been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything goes wrong its a double cd only tracks on each record most of them way too long as if adding a few minutes of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumbles but thats not really the main problem she has always mumbled all the way back to passionate kisses when her voice was still young and strong it has never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the songs a few extra times to pick up all the words what makes this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tunes to be honest i feel ive heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the songs doors of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copies of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong theres even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what was once a quite powerful rock ballad some reviews praise her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sounds flat uninterested and stale as if a group of capable studio musicians have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of roots music its the sound of old beer tired muscles and autumn rain its the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job has lucinda finally lost it have all the years of boozing and shorting finally taken its toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it was just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the idea was better than the songs that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had more than enough songs to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheels although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and in a world where good and original songwriters are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda has it in her this one however was just a big yawn to me 
0	thie album is pretty good redneck crazy is by far best song would not buy from amazon again have to use their player to down load and it is crap have to pa a year to add your tracks to it if you have over

1	i just discovered rosi golan heights group o lucky me she let the cat out of the bag songs of the heart from her heart and does so with a depth of feeling that is rare such yearn so beautifully expressed innocent she uses the minor mode in a way that expresses this yearn and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan heights there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything that it mustiness be literal and true love and that such love does subsist all the songs are marvellous but i particularly recommend come around think of me and yesteryear if you neediness to be transported to a put in the heart of literal love thank you rosi

0	this is a instead strange compilation the individual tail have little in common other than that they were made for movies this is a mix of single channel and stereo tail as well as of instrumentals and vocals it moderate fairly new medicine as well as some very erstwhile medicine the audio frequency quality is quite an good though some of the senior tail do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tail this mixed bag has very little break for it it would have been far skillful is theyd selected the tail in some manner it would have been far skillful as a collection of medicine from early films or of more recent films as it is it is a hodge podge that i real cant recommend to anyone

1	its definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz post bop and avant garde by listening to it you can find why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the s and dave holland was and is one of the most important bass players in the world barry altschul is superb as well and yes braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his but he fits here great anyway although being an item accustomed ears is not to be missed by any real music lover
1	excellent song
0	i really to be blown away by this album it was one of the selling records the year it came out and this record cemented lil wayne as one of the rappers on the planet you couldnt turn the tv on without seeing him or this record however there were only or so songs that i liked the songs just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me this review is not a reflection on weezys style or lyrics but the producing clearly the guy is talented the record just came as bland and repetitive me his with birdman was slammin i expected this record sound a little closer to that obviously i am in the minority here as the rest of the world cant get enough of this record
1	this album is a great example along of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the s and s while i think that maynard ferguson was middling the epitome of this big band incarnation minute woody brought a vitamin a pretty decent band along as well even though he was entering the last decade of vitamin a his life amazing guy amazing version of coalition la fiesta starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time were they all rolands dynamic and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff coalition crammed in the middle coalition shrieking trumpets a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamics as good a version as you will be find anywhere
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i couldnt help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beats on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you dont know that plays over and vitamin a over again to imply the listener didnt hear it the pitching first times the final you dont know drop a line ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very vitamin a inexperienced singer dont throw away vitamin a your money assistant adjunct and if its multiplication on attender the radio change the station
1	love this song its very catchy and very cute this whole album is such a wonderful find my infant son and i really have enjoyed every song but this is one of our top

0	the remaster is terrible like so much music remastered these days for mp players it is completely oversaturated so that the sound is pack together and garble and there is almost no dynamic compass the sound register looks like a brick this type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad distinguish and makes people retentive for vinyl it is absolutely possible to make a great digital remaster but this is not one of them boo

1	this more acoustic sound really suits haynes and is the best ive ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these songs out of which are haynes originals an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc arent bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demos are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fans overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette 
1	my little boy majuscule will listen to this song over and over great way for memorizing scripture
0	i was eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britains got talent on youtube when i first played it i something gone wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more times i realized it was actually the production hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this also the case in other songs but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to and her fans i hope she comes out with another cd future recorded with different people or a different company

0	honest by liam finn and eliza jane like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instruments had so much of screechy sound and the was just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and face i accidently got stuck with song when i was to download the amazon mp feature for another musical honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie anthem for womanizers and maneaters

1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the details of tan career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s geological era releases because theyre a small difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop music and light jazz genres i get the printing that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt tilt that tane herself was more occupy in pop music and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an creative person is fit to follow her own track obviously but i wish tane san wouldve exercise an album or ii more of straight forrader tilt because shes good at it and her voice is comfortably suited for it the hetero album is something that fans of tilt and female person vocalist should snap up at their number chance because although it has some underage downside its akin to a buried pop music tilt treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a foreign nigh playful verse takes some superbly unexpected wriggle in harmonise progression picks up a stark lose weight drumbeat then dives into an fantabulous middling angsty chorus which again cover a harmonise progression unlike anything ive heard before just a swell understated tilt tune down is former armed forces more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over unsubdivided pleximetry and late some subtle keyboard but heres where tan unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain on the dot why but her voice reminds me of sayornis phoebe pull the wool over someones eyes mayhap its because of that foreign vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same prison term but that comparison keeps chute out at me even eld after i number heard this disc slue the fruits is a small funky a small showy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and refrain there a cheering gnarly twangy guitar go in the bridge then back to that gliding groove then a rideout chorus that work the tune to an abrupt terminate just an fantabulous groove from get down to stopping point ame to gamu jaw gum confect is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that unremarkably bores the hell out of me but the vocal tune in this song is nix short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french piano accordion but it all lock perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that appear to station american language producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much prison term listening to nipponese tilt and pop music unrivalled of the number happy breakthrough you will have is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyze element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and virgin mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an copiousness of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an legal document on an even equality with guitar and vocal but i am really really happy thats the slip anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tan vocal carrying out is just phenomenal here and i nigh forgot something that puts a magnanimous goofy smile on my grimace every prison term i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a cite of that three harmonise figure in jimis wind cries virgin mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just throw me smile memoria is mayhap the best song on this album but slue by an aggravator in the recording the heavier component part are noticeably distorted you have to push that aggravator aside because memoria is just epic unrivalled of those call thats like a devout small journey or adventure it begins flabby as a plume physical body and physical body explodes in anthemic refrain then after a abbreviated acoustic bridge turns a street corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that physical body to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to terminate on that same flabby as a plume place it started this is unrivalled of those tunes you can listen to for the number prison term now yet will appear like it was the background for some of the most go see of your life a song thats been with you for eld that folks is right songwriting just a swell song easily unrivalled of my all prison term faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the refrain but swell song no jokester starts with tan sly vocal over piano and drums that reasoned a small like solo john john lennon but this is the tune i like to the lowest degree on the album mostly because of the refrain which have tane stretching her range too much amid reiterate of the line i wanna be your charwoman i wanna be your charwoman its not a hideous song but to me the refrain are awkward and a small annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good manner kakekko sprint or wash is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal tune and trace of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool soaker there also an understated acoustic swoop solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most showy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes exercise since but an fantabulous relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another showy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth throb then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the refrain the vocal tune is not as interesting as the rest of the call which leads me to conceive its unrivalled of those call that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicalness just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a small bit beyond the three most of import phrases in any voice communication namely where is the beer where is the comfort station and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree end out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tan voice refined through a lose weight radio mic speckle that fits the song perfectly there are ii break away into slower tempo grooves that are actually more right and spectacular than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im former armed forces more a tilt guy than either jazz or pop music so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from late albums hetero is her standout disc for that tilt element but again i motionless havent receive roughly to getting her other s magnetic disk if you like alt tilt thats generally upbeat rather than a monolithic boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique phonation get hetero in spades prison term comfortably spent
1	been wanting to get this song for years after selling my vinyl havent tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly

0	this cd climate length singe track audio song is really get across just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i mortal think it is south america or central america wildlife sounds generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar inwards or leapord loudly punctuates the mood sequence it reckon is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you put down know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy placidity listening to it again imagine you knew speech sound someone was going to yell in your ear placidity at some random point within astatine the next hour now try to relax
1	okay after using that annoying paronomasia allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the initiative album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt things though inauspicious get veracious to the album save up yall any more small scale talk i was bear some more of greenwoods songwriting after all usa is a superbly write call i wasnt bear these sleek numbers from mainstream nasvhille songwriters thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwoods part is rich and pure he get hold of these songs perfectly nonmeaningful and little in the hands of any other singer and turns them into something memorable most of em deal with love of flow it virtually makes me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the commonplace and when a womans in love is a play seem at how women palpate when their hearts get all fluttery at to the lowest degree from a mans perspective rocks that you cant move is about getting on with life through the rigour round here get hold of a seem at small scale town and the new first class emotional version of god bless the usa is as patriotic and strike as ever so lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is district thats been traversed before to be sure but his part is unique his sense of timing and style is un correspond aside from the excess picture taking not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be firm than time but its definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the commonplace seize the moment and along with it lee greenwoods firm than time

0	the instrumentation is amazing the vocals are very good but when i first heard the lyrics i just thought wtf this has got to be a joke why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song i was extremely let down it still gives me hope for the sound of this upcoming album if the lyrics were any better this would be one the most badass songs ever 
0	far too cloying the original fleetwood mac version was sweet without being cloying and is far far superior unfortunately that version is not available as a legal mp download im left with the option of buying the cd of bare trees for this song 
0	i would rate this cd as just ok for the money there are better sounding versions out there this has the uk mixes which sound flat and lifeless it has bonus tracks ironically from the us lp which are already on the album a better choice for bonus tracks would have been some songs that are not already on the album like ill get you baby its you i give it stars out of a possible 
1	maybe this album is not as good as rejoyce but its still great i just love her 
1	here we have some other prime example of dmb doing what they do best live shows this show is special for quite a few reasons unrivaled being only unrivaled of a few bands to play the historic wrigley field and this being their utmost show of the summer circuit this release is the nd night of a ii night streak if you were a phallus of the warehouse you could have gotten both nights anyways this show is incredible for those who quetch about the utmost tone ending good issues live in new york this release auditory sensation amaze and on a side note i could not really hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the show starts with an volatile you mightiness die trying a swell path to start affair off dave then sneak in the ever wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song you can severalize this is a special night for the band and the fans dave does a partial good good time a nice surprise for the fans that live square into nonetheless some other incredible and like every fan have intercourse dave and the band ever re invent the song there is so much energy department in this show it really feels like youre there in the crowd after the incredible ii step dave surprises nonetheless again with the beautiful christmas song and ends the show with none other than the utmost blockade if youre a fan just buy because you know its good if youre new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boys still prove that after years they have no foretoken of slowing down or end what they do best and if youre lucky enough to apprehension the train this summer im sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

1	leon cuts up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tunes the version on here of tumblin tumbleweeds alone is worth the authoritative roger williams price of the album also upwards you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than strain lone the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recordings not that theres anything wrong with total that its just a refreshing change for his fans

1	really good
0	this song is pretty slow i think i dont know why i didnt like it i just didnt like it very much 
0	very slick only giving the weeknd a single hook verse other than he would have killed this vocal very dissapointed dont buy if youre looking for the weeknd
0	i dont understand why adam obviously to so over let that beautiful voice the all of the talentless hacks in like his scene today hes a cut above in the vocal gone he doesnt need to do his in not a direction of department song selections and the fan hes pop in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock loves he shines me my opinion but lyrics adore him and this fearlessness hes wants doing what he where and just because it doesnt resonate with im doesnt mean its not worthwhile i just wish hed do more ballads songs with deeper i and process us hear raw adam in all its natural beauty
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part not a high point in an illustrious career 
0	t c ellis had a brief part in princes graffito bridge the album and the movie his delivery was excellent so i was unfeignedly depend forward to his solo debut regrettably true confessions come down short of the mark the first single miss thang was good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette singles the rest period of the album was middling t c ellis had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffito bridge that was sadly replaced with a obtuse choppy style on most of true confessions its potential that they hear to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the songs miss thang and cold thang however eve with decent samples and beats the rapping utlimately came crosswise as inexpert a good example is the track pussycat which samples george iii clintons atomic tail and lists the godfather of cringe as producer excellent beat and nice plume but the delivery by t c was anything but funky the deed of conveyance track was an extension of t c s whack on graffito bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
1	i love this song because it a me of the movie kill bill i phone use it as reminds ringtone for my even

0	i listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic are way had made her interpretation i personally cannot see this not a time about histrionics crowe about reflection version these and it mr cohen illustrates what loss is to lose a love later voegele life after a long relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young both who has lost the love of his is and will never love that but die man of love recordings ms looking back from god place of acceptance and reflection ms in has recorded a on which captures what it she like to have just lost that love and the wounds have not had song to scab over like job feels is as willing to accept that her suffering is just nor life she willing to curse a and again

0	this soundtrack was downloaded on a whim after i came across it while looking for another music title i remember hearing other similar flowing water creek soundtracks and thought that this would be similar but was disappointed i thought that this recording seemed fake as if made by a synthesizer or in a bathroom the track also seemed to be a second recording on a continuous loop like you i base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others if you liked my review or felt that it was helpful to you then please let me know by clicking yes below i would also be happy to answer any questions that you may have about this product thanks my reviews are real and typically based on weeks of actual product usage my opinions are not copied from other reviews and are from my own personal experiences

0	i have been a xtina fan since her knowing genie in a bottle days i was a teen when she first receive came out so i kinda feel like ive grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people have may not consider her vitamin a iconic but her voice is be one in a million most people that foremost came up around christinas be time world health organization dont even compare in vocal part range she had such a big voice for record album a pop star who didnt get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album but stripped was ducky a chance for her to show the world what information technology she could do depict on her information technology own terms and in her own words stripped is my firstly absolute favorite album of all in that location time she sang from the heart and great experience she took us on a journey of finding tramp her own voice in the figurative and literal sense tattle writing quite an her own songs and working with the inwards people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch was one of the best glucinium things shes ever done career wise vitamin a i dont know what happened be between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basics was successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it didnt shadow quite catch the essence of strippeds drop a line christina find oneself bionic was a huge fail even though she had a couple of great songs on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop songs lotus was an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign was up vitamin a after stripped there may be a couple of songs i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it stars but information technology they are nowhere near memorable it really sucks because xtina is a truly talented individual but sleep with either she needs to retire from music or get it together
0	while the package art is be nice disk i think thats about the best part of along this disc the best songs are at the end of the pine tree state disc and the new vocalist is o k but not a jon anderson most of the parcel songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous ive listened to this about a dozen times thinking it would grow on me but i just dont enjoy be it
0	i would rate flat it as just ok for uk money there are a sounding versions out there this has the the mixes which sound of and lifeless cd has bonus tracks ironically from the us lp which are already on the album a better choice for bonus tracks would have been some songs that are not already on the album like ill get you baby its you i give it stars out this better possible
0	this guy is terrific however this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content every song on one is on the other in the take order and i bought both thinking theyd be different really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with sort titles great performer probably a properly guy but permit take one of those off the market it makes this extraordinary artist feeling comparable either a business amateurish or sneaky

0	i had heard the season that jordin was on in american general i had heard a song chords just radio probably too much and decided to download today based on a sing i watched today i have to say i like the song but the prove is really now course of given the whole chris other thing it makes nothing feel disgusted about idol in him but really this song emotional a sappy love song and the ending is me but them shouting out random on and overly is notes that seem to compete more and more with each snippet the longer it goes know to ending they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long i along you can both brown modern day air supply blech but might appeal to this lot of people the not me just my opinion
0	this album was a huge letdown it is way first dissatisfactory and was commercial light rock being on huge fan of all that remains owning all of their other albums nearly gone to too can this album was a they disappointment melodic shows be cool if it is still heavy like a their older albums but this album popish not having heavy album for me i dont like the the they have gone in i liked direction their single major released which prompted me to purchase this enough but the rest of it was melodic i dont recommend this album to hardcore and metalcore fans

1	honestly i was never a huge fan of this song the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song one of his favorites he thinks its really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentines day ive always known the lyrics were romantic but they have more meaning for me now also this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper versions his voice doesnt bother me now just goes to show how important recording quality really is 
1	skilful song
1	my youll had to me one day i tears in his eyes playing this well on his phone he said he only came one request of me dad promise me that if i me pass before you that son the song at my funeral song what could with say but only if youll do play same for should son very touching day for us thanks guys
0	saw them perform well a talk show and thought i might like them oh on
1	i really liked this album thwarted when it first came out one of the songs was even featured on starsky and hutch dont give majuscule up on us baby was a safe great feature go to song for couples and i really liked the rest upper case letter of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor its hard to explain the states each song can hold its own even though make david soul is best known as an actor director he did a great job strain operating theater with playing to an audience of one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this selection
0	wow this album is awful i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo days royce too since the late s budden is a great lyricist joell is dope he has been one of my favorite rappers the last couple of years the first album was really good some filler on it it was recorded in days they took years on this album most of the songs released on the internet before the first album dropped were great so many quotables green lantern freestyle was sick the mastering on this album sucks period im listening on a rega system where is the production from the alchemist they sounded great over just blaze production on the song with em they are trying to get into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly they pick the worst beats from these producers yes these guys can rhyme why cant they make good songs unless they are rapping over someone elses beats the singles were weak but i expected that guest features from cee lo singing that awful hook busta skyler grey never heard of her bob swizz and em wtf i blame eminem jimmy iovine and interscope records yes these guys deserve success but not with this album knick knack paddy wack how i wanna bone cmon joell these reviewers are saying they are bringing back lyrics im going to listen to the hip hop weekly series mood muzik the bar exam and pretend our house never came out and to that first review killer mike r a p music is the album of the year so far

1	we lost this wonderful country singer way too young his songs calm the soul and lift your spirits he will be missed 
1	recording quality isnt that great 
0	ok jason moran vitamin a is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this vitamin a muted work former the problem comes when you record album are looking for something else proud of this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be fountainhead grounds record album okay disappointed to top it off the themes included in this album are dull and flat
1	strain good song
0	bob dylan should know better he no longer has old voice moral of can story dont get a etc think you the still sing this also applies to harry nilson paul mccartney and
0	horrible sings through his nose and steal all of his slip guitar licks from others dont bother with this one
0	unfortunately this album does not the all of the shanties cadences is a shame since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the since and these are very which doesnt our similar military this album to contain all of them here is contain youtube video with of the shanties
0	played is only relevant for the vinyl version the is got the piece of plastic itself once this music im a very big about fan not i saw brendon its about this hear preordered it i received it on the day a the release april all good only today i panic to listen to it tweeted all this a tiny bit too high pitched and it in sync next to of digital version of the same songs you can i it playing even without first time i this it and i swear i watched just thing like a hawk and cared for it victorious it was my child theres a lot of jumping in like dont and threaten me with a good time
1	liked it when i was a kid her version michael jackson almost exact now im by it she has such a way about her no prince and quincy jones and whitney houston and all rest admire her talent
0	as of this writing many of the be tracks on this album are misnumbered mislabled
1	granddaughter make love ts
0	im merely not sure what those who gave this or endure stars are be good hearted thinking this is awful i realize there will always be sycophants of be certain bands who are so enamored with them they will always rate stars when its painfully obvious stars are not in order this is certainly one of those times this cd is horrific and thats being charitable i in that location non love old van halen they are among my all time faves but this who in their right minds can mavin give this crap stars worry much less or dlr sounds terrible reprehensible i wont even go into the sammy vs david argument since mavin i never really cared for the hagar years i love sammy as a solo merely artist but didnt care smitten for his work with van halen but i prefer his mediocre work with them to roths garbage now
0	frankly i have no idea what other review is trying to say i will issue a caution to anyone considering this track notice that this is a remix of levels and not the version you probably know from the radio if youre a dj this could be a great addition to if not well this might be what youre looking for anyway be warned that this is pretty mind numbingly repetitive
1	love this song very inspiring and felt i could listen to it all day it makes my so with the spirit
0	the only two strain that are worth listening for me are the disco strain i was passing discomfited in the despicable me song i was expecting the song corresponding in the opening of the film and i was lupus erythematosus than happy when a chorus of childrens voices started chiming in i dont recall that from the picture show at all i enjoy the picture show very much but i cant recommend this album if your concern rest in more of the picture show edition of the strain rather than the strain on this atomic number i should have demo the strain before ordering but i do corresponding the disco strain that are not available for download
1	go out him on agt and loved his version of this song had to buy it will hopefully obtain some other songs
0	if you want conscious breathing exercises i would rate this a great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes the problem i had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place i bought the cd to get further into conscious deep sleep i had the reverse effect however as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body the meditation does work i feel refreshed yet energized 
1	i absolutely love this merely album i play it constantly these songs are just perfect
1	great birdsong

0	im sorry little but i did not like this cd i was so impressed the untested last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and say some of their make own creations immortalise like a soh piece safe of rock and roll and drama queen very good songs strain but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kids are very talented and great musicians geezerhood however i thought the song writing was bad the lyrics bad and the vocals were bad vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah needs to take ownership of the tattle vocals and put her own signature and personality into them not just safe read develop them off the sheet of paper she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent remember indigence her office janis joplin cover turtle blues thats what im talking about she needs to do more of that be this band has much more talent immortalise than what was displayed on this latest cd somebody needs to help them with their songwriting it was all over the place along on this cd im hoping they can turn it roughly around but for now im backing off for a while to see routine where they go from here good luck you guys
1	this is the music from euphony the opening scene porta of the movie center layer cake wherein daniel craig plays a fascinating vulnerable role as a middle man for a recreational medication group in the uk interesting concept for a movie and the music grabs your grab attention also
1	good
0	this cd set is okay but stupefy a little monotonous after a while i was hop skip it would be better but its okay
0	her music is horrible and she supports endorses and sleeps with lilo brancato a cop killer if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you dont care and are not part of a civilized society 
0	the problem with stimulate the prevue is that they never let you hear the ends of song i dont experience whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album but several of the songs have the last note or deuce hack off either completely or right in the middle of a note not a lot of joy there i will say that there are some songs on the album that are all right but stimulate flap down the like that really ruins everything badly probably go through the album again and take these songs from my device
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and its still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance but this one grates on my nerves first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song thats what this song totally rides on at least chris brown even though its a similar beat has something going for his song with you better lyrics nice video altogether i just dont appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in second i will never forget you youre in everything i do later just like a tattoo ill always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own songs and maybe youll get some attention stars end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who isnt afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these days in the studio because it seems like everyone has nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g but copying a songs beat that has previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyrics are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stands out 
1	classic michael jackson how can you be anything less than thrilled at thriller its just a great album at a great price its times less and you cannot go wrong with adding this gem to your collection
0	nothing that worth mentioning but an perfect good tracc with brandy was o k picture dumb s t shouldve been without snoop an blacc ty
1	the entire compact disk is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my favorites although the entire magnetic disc you can play from start to finishing and mob tanks music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really suppurate with this compact disk the great thing is he didnt try to adjust to some of the newer antics with his heavy he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate for the ladies tank moving picture show on the inside pass over proves to be an extra bonus for us lol

0	after i had heard david talk about this project i have to admit i was excited to get my hands on this box set from one of my fav bands i could not even get through songs before i realized what a collection of cutting room garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past i find nothing new or the slightest bit interesting about the on this disc the songs done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good about this disc collection the booklet is kind ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you a couple of years and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollars lol
1	typical hank williams jr modern country with a serious message makes me proud to be an american 
0	bad of a tribute cd but as myself id really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp the moon revisited is basically nine different artists that cover track each of the famed dark side moon album if youre a major and i do floyd nut you may get more out of this cd than i did the track the gig in the sky about me nearly crying for mercy the woman vocalist just goes on and on to put it way the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band tunes like speak to me brain damage and eclipse are okay at best
0	did not have the intro make music

1	possibly the best soundtrack be ever to this genre perhaps and kind of movie this soundtrack is a perfect perhaps example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie nothing fancy just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fits perfectly with the euphony time period a perfect example of motion picture how less part can be far more effective
0	its not ok what i expected

1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your gustatory modality summary buy of simply find it on you subway
1	first came out as was the bands second lp maybe not a but pretty decent symphonic title at that this gardens of delight pressing has an added tunes i liked were the title back on my hill stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two members heinz mikus guitar vocals and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a they released several more efforts rock lions hard breath and gold n glory check em out

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriters mostly a good cover band with a athletic showman up front and of the best merchant guitar players in the of rock probably a great bar band when they started i saw them in their early days when i was a teenager care that dlr a mediocre at best his energy and the musical chops the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal he ever possessed has long since evaporated lee roth is not merely in the way that many so called rock of the bad nor in the that many older rock icons like springsteen and lose their limited vocal appeal as they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible who should never be feet of a microphone still he clearly knows it and rather try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyrics or his correct lazier vocals than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have this on unsuspecting public
0	only songs good
0	why is amazon sell nazi propaganda
1	xawesomehave heard this song done a routine of ways this by far is one of the best
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sounds like a soundtrack for a low budget movie i love the thalia that gave us amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell every single efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for crying out loud the only one thats good and the only reason i gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad besides the fact that she hired estefano to work with her i was expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her star paulina but no i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano was just not there and also i agree with the one who said that she needs to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment 
0	well in short not good at all not basics chemical romance style if they felt like getting back to the my at least go back to decent music like three cheers

0	i am a huge manowar fan since i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm i have seen the band live probably times both in the us and in europe and have met them personally on occasion it pains me to say it but this album is horrid yes the production is poor but that is not the main problem the songs themselves would not have made any of teh previous albums i liked gods of war this is the first manowar album i have heard and i have heard them all many times that lays totally flat sounds bad and does not have a single song that i find worthy i would not expect many or any of these tracks to make it to a live show i am still a fan of the band i always will be but i need to call it what it is horrid 
0	trash with disgusting texts and music
0	i feel like a traitor saying this but i wont be buying this set any time soon vitamin a i stand second to none in my affection for coif the band but unfortunately this career spanning retrospective is seriously whatsoever lacking in representation of the last years of that recording career by my count fondness there are only about five songs resign on this set that were released after not good glucinium enough capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boys compilation that is a whole lot light headed heavier on newly gathered songs and a whole sentence lot lighter on the re light headed re retreads

1	great album no on it that i dislike every one is worth listening to the lyrics are interesting the musical style varied frankly sounds cool and long album which i always appreciate worth every penny
0	after listening to the previews on amazon i decided buy the actual cd ive always liked dj shadow and was interested to hear what kind he was making now in it typical shadow ambiances and found sounds but some tracks have wildly swung broken patterns like flying lotus and like a few tracks attempt a dubstep feel but it comes across as plodding a couple even have some trap hat and tripleted patterns those actually sound the coolest the part that makes me absolutely dislike the album even parts are ok is the rapper in the rap track that states that trump has sex with his youngest daughter so that rapper i would keeping your politics to yourself unless you wanna lose half of your audience moby just did the same im selling his now as he mouthed off about trump
1	this is a classic anyone into hard punk should give this album a try especially good riddance is an amazing song great precision and no mercy

0	pops i one there are two dirty words in the song and know wanted the clean version that you listen on radio radio so i could hear to it even if my child so into the room but instead of using another word like the the edit this one uses cartoon effects very weird and just as you are getting into the song that pops this wish i wouldnt have bought up i

1	lorraine feather is the complete package here are incredible intelligence and uniqueness beautiful voice all embracing ranging moods and arrangements constantly surprising and satisfying you mustiness hear lorraine feather to believe it can be this good
1	jonatha brooke jargon has one of the most beautiful voices ive ever heard be she is also one of the most under rated songwriters in the country the story was a rather short lived person group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the harmonies that jonatha and jennifer created were are convey inspired and at times their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears my two favorite songs from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much musical harmony mine my absolute favorite still is a gorgeous song played impeccably strain well by highly skilled trunk musicians the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true dancing artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo albums is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title automobile trunk commend from the alan parsons project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas albums both solo and from make the story are inwards dissolve highly recommended her voice would melt even the sing hardest of hearts and her song saint writing along with away her interpretations of other artists songs is roughly inspiring and at times vitamin a haunting her songs stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of be work as a whole i just cant imagine why handout she isnt more popular some of inwards her music has an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythms and percussion that make you want to likewise dance while some center of her be songs make you want to cry she is that good strain i dont know what else to say write other drop a line than buy her music
0	a think that i must have got i bad copy because this sacd from awful it sounds like a cd sounds

1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to luxuriant a little chip lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first record album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the cellular inclusion of divinity hallow the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt things though ill get right to the record album save yall any more low let the cat out of the bag i was expecting some more of greenwoods songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek numbers from mainstream nasvhille songwriters thats the bad affair the good affair is greenwoods voice is deep and pure he takes these birdcall absolutely nonmeaningful and piddling in the pass on of any other singer and change by reversal them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost ready me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely head off the bromide and when a womans in love is a fun look at how women feel when their hearts get all fluttery at least from a mans perspective rocks that you bevel locomote is about have on with life through the hardships round of drinks here takes a look at low towns and the new excellent emotional version of divinity hallow the usa is as loyal and moving as ever lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure enough but his voice is unique his gumption of timing and expressive style is united nations matched aside from the excess photography not mischievously done but unneeded this record album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but its definitely the record album of the here and now so to continue on with the bromide seize the here and now and along with it lee greenwoods stronger than time

0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sounds like someone who has spent a bit too much time in clubs and has made some friends with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyrics provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to

1	great remix of great of the key show of the show gives a one feeling to a strong songs number
0	i was in my twenties when i first listened to this album it made a very poor impression then but i thought id go and take another look some decades later this trios creative contributions to the band during jim tenure were inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard renditions robby kriegers classical level and songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the for arguably of greatest rock bands what i from these guys particularly from the of their grief over their friends death from such sadness often springs the most heartfelt forms of creativity was an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some the doors most popular and while rays singing ability was pretty questionable he the others were exceptional musicians who could plumb the in most songs i wouldve expected the songs by and large to sound distinctly doorsian not in rays at least in the instrumentals and structure basic mood of the songs this is what i expected what i received was a collection of songs that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender of outpouring of creative angst from depths of their artistic souls their lyrics and melodies sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melodies and lyrics that were doors at their gloomy best even their song titles practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe knowing who these guys were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearances this review isnt about bashing the surviving members the doors they provided far too much pleasure me as a young man and still do to regard them with anything but deepest respect and for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated some rocks best songs have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed well beyond his songwriting skills even his incomparable vocals i believe that contribution was most fundamentally serve as a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melodies and lyrics something about i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and morrison wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more anything he provided a clear and stellar what they about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guys even now that something wonderful would believe the post morrison albums vividly demonstrate that jim was more his stage antics a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he a primal creative force a dionysus to bandmate maenads they were a holy force without him they were merely creatures stumbling through the forest
0	this is one of the worse gospel compilation ive heard this has nothing to do with gospel its a mix match of melodies poorly played

1	one of the best compilations a be great way to meet and learn about yes when most people mix in glucinium think of rock music the general roughly conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dopes then be knock groups like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication glucinium these tunes are not only enjoyable they also nurture ones synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpieces

0	if werent so badly warped it would be fantastic maybe if you are lucky and get another batch
0	no this is not another ive been a fan of since this or that record usually wheels on road which everyone seems to worship and i was really so disappointed because she a mumbles slurs or isnt as good as she was on car true ive liked in a world of boy and shallow pop a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent in the borderland between country blues and rock life hasnt always been easy which in her voice in this her latest release i feel that goes wrong its a double cd only tracks on each record most of them way too long as if adding a few minutes of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumbles but thats not really the main problem she has mumbled all the way back to passionate kisses her voice was still and strong it has never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the songs few extra times to pick up the words what makes this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself complete lack of tunes to be honest i feel ive heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at three of the songs doors of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale of something i only vaguely remember and the final track faith and is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong theres even a version of bruce springsteens she to take every ounce of life and out what was once a quite powerful rock ballad some reviews praise her which stripped down and pretty basic to me it sounds flat and stale as if a group of capable studio musicians have been in to try make a decent effort for the grand old lady of roots music its the sound of old beer tired muscles and autumn rain its the sound of could have mark could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job has lucinda finally lost it have all the years of boozing and shorting finally its toll this is supposed be a concept album of the highway and maybe was just an gone something she felt strongly to make although the idea was better than songs that out of it i liked her previous album where she had more enough songs to make it a double liked little honey i liked sweet old world better than car although i might be accused of blasphemy for so and in a world where good and original songwriters are few and between i still hope and believe that has it in her one however just a big yawn to me
0	there unfortunate that its isnt a negative rating day the disc took five weeks to arrive both the arrived quality and the renditions of the songs were it even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging recycled the scale abysmal sound
0	i love the soundtrack to psycho herman its one perfectly of my favorites of all time so you can imagine how delighted i psychotic was to see this release was available i bought it as soon as i activate saw it and was excited when it showed up on my mind doorstep i put it on my turntable and was horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality was it erst was accumulate like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs activated i couldnt believe how dreadful it sounded dire and absolute insult to bernard hermans classic score so if youre like me and collect and enjoy listening to soundtracks on vinyl erstwhile do yourself a favor horror struck and dont make the same mistake i did

0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it for exampl e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders a complete and utter waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence but will certainly line the pockets of daniel goleman dont waste your money on this no help whatsover book

0	singer this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is for maiden steve may be should main composer in maiden but british lion proves and he cant achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden richard by himself he does need the other guys also the of that harris got this singer richard taylor iron the album the bruce between difference dickinson and this guy is blaze the difference between but ferrari and a beat up bicycle im not saying told it have been on the album but that bailey should have known what fans expected dissapoints him that gotten a decent yes even like bailey is a good singer he didnt have the energy and the connection to the fans that a lead steve in iron maiden requires a blaze singer can sing i dont know who bruce could album taylor that he this sing

0	garbage joe derosa is not a rummy funny man
0	i remember liking this song when it was popular yrs ago really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era and since am i the only one that thinks she absolutely cannot stay in tune she flats out every few bars she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average overall kind of meh 
0	i do not to recording sound of any kind once so ever however this album as by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late s would have have submitted to a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood the words of the so called economic recovery of the states overall if this were his first it would a higher rating but it is not i truly find amazing that jack johnson on using renewable sources of energy to power his recording sessions i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound was the best he and his engineers could come up if this is supposed to sell people on the green and its approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	neer rec it
0	clicked the this too quickly before noticing its not on original
1	liz had rough couple of years with being said she has come out the other side than ever with more of a blues rock sound and hard living lyrics exodus of venus is best work to date
0	pay atttention from a have tape and does not mix the whole song pointless
0	wanted song with the words just instrumental
0	adams is so deeply buried under the effects that is unrecognizable second album was the best was starting to define his style and worthy songs the is weak and the lyrics are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to mainstream pop star he was never that his forte was his wide range style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words his interpretation of classics on american idol mad world tracks of my tears made songs his own he toured with queen and was as good or better live than freddie mercury vocally though he couldnt match stage presence or personality i guess his first two cds didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholders so this is a last ditch to attempt to turn into a middle aged justin we dont need another shallow pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad
1	jeff williamss second outing as composer for rwby is a home run he creates wonderful music that gets your blood pumping and your head bobbing personal favorite tracks are shine and caffeine but theyre all great tracks thats just as awesome as rwby itself

0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be buying any more nor is this a worthy example of trip hop imo this is way overrated i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day yet i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker pimps becoming x etc there are a few good tracks but for the most part its a mish mash maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length repetitive running loops while a guy mumbles self aware hipster speak gets dull fast ya know getting a few decent female soul singers and a sequencer doesnt make a good record 
1	great mix in mix
1	we just got this for christmas and its a wonderful cd my quaternity year old is asking great dubiousness about the songs
0	i purchased by remastered a to replace cd worn out a way mobile fidelity vinyl copy most from the start hotel and have to say that while licensing a fan of of of friday musics reissues this remaster sounds like it was the directly from a digital source such as year my all to full it all bright and forward from the very mars to end and i have an warm sounding straight tube preamp my at mobile fidelity japan pressed year old copy sounds much more pressed and is superior in almost every old in fact i panicked and bought lp this mint copy on amazon from a wonderful was a few days later earlier last year mofi seller supposed to re release this album on lp but decided not to at transferred last minute and friday music picked up the im rights instead this reissue isnt sounds bad though as i found phil leshs bass guitar very very lp the rich throughout the recording and and lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at grams it was natural old rti in california and sounded good standards control quality were obviously taken used the staff that produced this recording
0	i had hopes of nice old style quality christmas hymns and songs them guidepost empty albums we you not so of is a cd set and loads of and there many of from are kind this jazz style strange slow singing tracks vinyl feeling but were a few pleasant traditional pieces but have have to wade through a number of not songs to get there if you want to for it might be worth the money but if you are looking experiment some uplifting christmas music i would dragging recommend this
0	rental banjo i not simply disappointed by the overall sound i and mumfords first album and thought the second one was just as good if was cds i was very it to receive this cd the first day it came out no after listening to it three times out felt end i to bored after the first week i accidentally left it in the cd two of my no car when i that excited loved made but effort to retrieve it i hold end hope returned the group makes a th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original player better so terrific
1	there are really only a few things in life we can look on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee audio amaze and strictly flawless on the drums while campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo disdain all the health problems lemmy has had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy tangle vocal performance the songs are as attention getting as ever and shoot out all the lights contains a dandy call and answer incision motorhead have ever been open of busting out a dandy lay and this doesnt change with the infectious til the destruction every song is a fascinating and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stones sympathy for the devil not very many bands could pull off a stones cover but sanctum horseshit does motorhead slay this song i was twinkly from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimicker jagger but instead puts his own alone tangle spin on the vocals while phil plays a copulate of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drum this album is pretty much perfect and this dance orchestra needs a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

0	as a fan of we were looking forward to new cd set with great when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of releases tso this concept left us cool there is very little that is melodic and a of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listeners with extremely diverse musical but i must say this was a bust we never listen to it and had we previewed it would never have purchased
0	nothing new here except the packaging this collection is ilk the first time inclusion of information technology singles from their recent lackluster album thats why god made the radio the reason i highlight singles is because what the heck is of course a single these days although there was actually a rpm vinyl single issued of easy divinity thats why god made the radio it deity was just issued only for probably admit adult get across collectors sidereal day like me the other new single isnt it time only exists on the album back in the days of top radio we called these album tracks not singles included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibrations come on guys isnt it time that a stereoscopic photograph stereo mix officially comes out most beach boys songs were recorded on state of the art deity for those lusterless times recording equipment also included are radiocommunication several more should sport be stereo mono tracks do there it again surfin safari i get around the little girl i once knew help pic me rhonda fun fun fun and ever so of course good vibrations unexplicably missing take on is their first hit surfin take on plus many of their biggest hits like be true to your school and of course their holiday season hits also included are some non hit album tracks listenning to the mono tracks most sound like early cds tinny and bassy and are definitely not remixed i dont think folder that erstwhile brian would ever have okd these without at least re prohibited eqing them on the plus side included are black white photos be of the beach boys in their younger days pre gray fat and bald each disc comes make in its own sleeve disc their young days and disc the old farts theres also a nice untested booklet which could easily fit in a jewel case both along cds look like mid s swirl label capitol vitamin a s the sound is great and pillow slip does offer many of their best songs
1	leon cuts up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tunes the version on here of tumblin tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recordings not that theres anything wrong with that its just a refreshing change for his fans
