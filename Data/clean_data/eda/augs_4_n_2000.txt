0	world i detest getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa state that it wa hypothetic to be the best develop album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt deserving producing well to begin with there is a crew of filler among a couple of meh vocal not one individual song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating zip here is suitable of being added to the live placed or suitable of being added to the listing of jackyls best of unremarkably i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a succeeder here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only track that seem to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rpm it up and kick the bucket already the same can be state for just because im drunk it just a water down adaptation of secret of the bottle i dont nonplus why some have already state come up is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric come up come up come up uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by missing to see a come up car being driven by that year old terpsichore baby invigoration thing not to observe the chorus line seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed to shake me range me or jackly me off in any manner sure the production is unspoiled but you acknowledge what they say about something in particular that you can smooth the attempt at a deeper sound of metallic element too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce rear but they sure are not the same dance band they once where they really need to find themselves again and knead out what made their first class honour degree couple of album great zip here is suitable of being remarkable of a jackyl classic
0	okay effort is certainly than victim of at but even though it a comeback in comparison to those failed album this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky rock of the westies etc many of the on the fox come frustratingly close being classic ej song just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the song fall a short my advice skip this one and jump up which isnt a great album is a better example of elton john returning to anything close to his s

0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because like me you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of orton blair daly barnbill dennis chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not the band with only song out of entirely by a band member apparently band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum brockman drum and to the of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus ha played guitar and key a well a treating to some singing am glad he had some fun but i not paying to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had to listen to all those other people i have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too to ask be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted listen chicago i dont mind if i dont like the song a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the producer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they to write and record it own music only a name to milk a they did with chicago and far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the band by showing that a their producer he belief that composition and playing of all those other would somehow be better the album that of the chicago themselves his treatment of in particular is almost unbelievable guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play drum on of song this is joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy he seems to me be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of if he wa proud them he would disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after pause of year what choose to go out on and what and memory leave behind they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad from any out take any of the album from to written and performed great by others is unworthy epitaph a band that used to be more than just a name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to avoide this album save your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of chicago to you will several piece here will enjoy very much buying for occasional listening if are fan chicago to you are not going care who made song and played them and you will totally love the whole of this album which more of the same it ha some good by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album good production buy it and love it

0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the euphony business organization a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the terrible garishness war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate motorcar and subsequent release of classic beatles record the pack together of an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a mountain pas from album to album on his ipod a note here the standardization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall caliber of sound the maiden fourth dimension i had heard anything by chasten impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent euphony to walk home by and wa enjoyably surprised it came in a very nice quail enwrap digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which listing the lyric everything software wise is very secure and i must say again that the album art at to the lowest degree for me is one of the best that ha arrive in quite a while but once i rend it to my pc using eac my pinna had started to distress after the sixth song i decided to affirm my opinion that the cd had been overly compact by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i fancy that lonerism ha so been sham negatively by the terrible trend of over compression before i oddment the review i must state that this album euphony wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that in the long time to arrive lonerism will perplex an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail sacking feel disengage to disagree ask me anything in the comment redact a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume layer turned up to the guide of over compression and twisting drum in particular sound a good deal better buy the cd and or vinyl group and support the creative person and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two whiz still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there
0	though ill take some responsibility i downloaded from itunes should could have listened to the sample my bad how can they use the same name a an already existing band and produce music like this while using that name really it should be an outrage im stuck with stupid music that i paid for oh well ill just chalk it up to my own carelessness hopefully it wont come up in random very often

1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein

1	this more acoustic sound with cover haynes and is the best shorter ever heard him do on song i live earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like is on varied perfect boot that artist give apparently blister and trail for many mile of of i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes his writing itself fitting only so so and the more stripped down demo recording on the ive disc arent bad although none of own seem essential in fact them with the final railroad track weak and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the suit of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fan overall a great version really plenty last tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an no tireless will thought a vast and that palette
0	have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i say i very disappointed with this album like many chicago fan i am partial to the chicago that in the early seventy these were the time which band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm terry kath and cetera however a most fan the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty one might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement he didnt contribute a single contributed very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or to see them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have doing from a compositional standpoint for last robert lamms solo subtlety and passion s p is an excellent many way it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the that cetera there are some funky mix here but what they they sure dont seem too chicago and there are the horn everybody know the chicago horn the band it trademark the horn to wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single these guy are musician need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
0	the problem with getting the preview that never let you hear the end of song i dont know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the but several of the song have the note or two cut off either completely or right in the middle of a note not a lot of joy there will say there are some song on the album that are fine but getting slammed like that really ruin everything ill probably go through album again and remove these my device

0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival and loved every single song based on that i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it after hearing these song i definitely will not be purchasing this album the girl are definitely beautiful all right it easy to see why theyre so well loved because of it but on this album their voice havent matured enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their later work where they dont sing with little girl voice and their song selection is a little more mature

0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most emphasise men however the like i find this cd hoosier state completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical deadening merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd regain astatine is essentially the same a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a year old glucinium over uproarious unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems footling to be there only incidentally quondam i vitamin a suppose some folk would know that a cd simply with a penis on the cover and a title daniel chester french like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling point trust me they aint

0	i bought this album after seeing the electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to the best album i dont agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary even those dont sizzle like the live performance on and the production quality is not great either you cant really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had great for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue

0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a soulful even impression then but i thought id go lacking and take another look contributed decade and this trio creative his i the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique regard doorsian keyboard rendition robby kriegers often level guitar playing and in songwriting and and john densmores understated simply beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest they band what i expected guy these guy particularly impressive ray depth pleasure their grief over their friend death sounded such sadness classical voice the of heartfelt form of creativity wa an from soul produced singing of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while the outpouring ability wa pretty questionable he more soul a were result exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by song large to about distinctly poor if to superb ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i expected what i received wa im collection of song that imposed my ear from from a garage band post a bender you of an outpouring of creative knowing subversive the depth most their artistic rock their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal back even review faintest trace of his rich from haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their them gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity a horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not angst who these like a would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance fertile the isnt about bashing the surviving member my the door they provided far too much of for me a a young man and still do to very gloomy with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving others mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of the best ability have chilling something so devoid of creative out of best theory so far is that jim morrison some something well beyond his songwriting anything and even his incomparable vocal serve than that contribution wa most fundamentally and i were a focus for the bandmates creativity he may also have to a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something provided morrison instead think drew merit the best in krieger manzarek and densmore later perhaps morrison but wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps not skill believe he sound a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a this world where of musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if to placed a young hungry jim morrison in front their these guy creative now that something wonderful would still i believe the on morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing spring and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to contribution bandmate maenad with him rock were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest

1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt thing though ill get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you cant move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time
1	excellent recording i can not stop listening to this once bought this i got all other master in this series a
1	i have hundred of xmas am a dylan fan read all the recap here wanted to add i love this cd i gibe with all the detail in the star recap habit repeat them but what stand out is the sincerity classic feel of the system here it is warm glowing like a warm fireplace dylan rasping vocalise add together the spice crackling of the log for me this cd smell like xmas a much a sinatra manilow or bing unlike other bad name star who make the obvious xmas collection dylan somehow wa able to produce a standard that gain me want to play it over over definitely a keeper from left field to center stage

1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can understand from listening to her music and i havent however hear all of her s era discharge because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the immense legal age of her knead subsequent to the s fall into the soda water and lighter jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her handler or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in soda water and lighter jazz but assent to a harder butt on record album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an record album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes beneficial at it and her voice is swell suited for it the hetero record album is something that fan of rock and distaff vocalist should rupture up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried soda water rock treasure since there no track listing here ominous do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back get going with a strange almost playful rhyme take some marvellously unexpected flex in chord progression pick up a desolate reduce drumbeat then plunge into an splendid somewhat angsty greek chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive hear before just a enceinte understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting sung mental attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and sung over simple percussion and after some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice cue me of fin coke maybe it because of that strange vibrato which fathom both tightly curb and loose at the same time but that comparison keep alternate out at me even year after i first hear this disc weakened the yield is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful drifting upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarled twangy guitar break in the nosepiece then back to that glide groove then a rideout greek chorus that add the tune to an abrupt closing just an splendid groove from depart to finish ame to gamu chewing gum confect is hard to describe again it sung over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily drill hole the the pit out of me but the sung melody in this sung is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentality synth wash and daniel chester french accordion but it all network perfectly the nosepiece is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened cony if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and soda water one and only of the first glad uncovering you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely classify to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone pipe buried deep in the background but rather is an constitutional catalyzing component of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on land masaki of daida laida and daydream koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin out king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and madonna hibiki of lighter bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even equality with guitar and sung but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable sung and tanes sung carrying into action is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big sappy smile on my nerve every time i take heed to this sung is the fact that the cobbler last three harmonize of the sung are a quote of that three chord cypher in jimis meander cry madonna whether thats incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the near sung on this record album but cut by an vexation in the recording the impenetrable persona are noticeably misrepresented you have to push that vexation aside because memoria is just epic one and only of those song thats like a earnest little journey or risk it begin soft a a feather build and build detonate in anthemic chorus then after a abbreviated acoustic nosepiece play a corner into an unexpected melodically wizard handing over that build to it own crescendo with tane rain cat and dog heart and soul into the sung to closing on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one and only of those tune you can take heed to for the first time today however will seem like it wa the background for some of the most moving have of your life a sung thats been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a enceinte sung easily one and only of my all time faves it unfortunate that the direct misrepresented the the pit out of the guitar on the chorus but enceinte sung no joker get going with tanes tricky sung over piano and drum that sound a little like solo whoremonger lennon but this is the tune i like least on the record album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her chain too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it not a hideous sung but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the nosepiece is just weird and not in a beneficial mean kakekko dash or race is a mellow groove with a reasonably sung melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool torrent there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the nosepiece kage no naka no kage vestige in the middle of a vestige is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the gormandize shes done since but an splendid slacken groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is some other jazzy tune mellower than kage with just sung over electric piano and some periodical synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentality with the chorus the sung melody is not a concern a the rest of the song which meander me to believe it one and only of those song that rest more heavy on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the wash room and i love you broadly in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree close out the record album in a dreamy atmospherical backwash with tanes voice serve through a reduce radio mic piece that convulsion the sung perfectly there are two break into sluggish pace groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster pace of the rest of the sung an understated but unrelentingly cool tune im far more a rock guy rope than either jazz or soda water so although there are a lot of her tune i like from after album hetero is her standout disc for that rock component but again i even havent gotten roughly to father her other s disc if you like alt rock thats broadly upbeat rather than a massive gravy boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you love totally unique voice get hetero definitely time swell spent

0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism the animal third album the first beeing the animal and the second animal track i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job ive heard so far the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track a complete failure repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try thank god i have the original on tape in stereo
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day im not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the s stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then spent the next year releasing various compilation live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but radio wouldnt have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the s but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let be honest even a lot of the material on their early record werent great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they dont want to which is fine but then it probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album

0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound over compress a recording to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued many including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey to turn the volume up a notch from album album on his ipod a note here the normalization would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of the first time i had heard anything by tame wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with gorgeous album art in a on the cover the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise is good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my had started to hurt after the song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively the dreaded trend of over compression before i end review must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that in the to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it essentially the same mix without volume level turned up to point of over compression and distortion drum in sound much better buy the cd or and support the artist then go look for that particular version great album problem solved two star stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there

0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why

0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion drum in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there
1	i just love it the music is will through with
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their firstly cd then dont even inconvenience with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my hunch that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent opinion to create an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that altogether to attempt to live up to their childhood dream of play in metallica is candidly depressing from a fan solid absolutely love their firstly effort i give this album thumb down please for the love of insert your choose deity or spiritual force here revert back to your pilot sound trivium
1	download this but tell make to you tube and watch the couple of the isnt of this song this guy ha that real magic and him his affect on live audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison he will go eye contact with just one person to for just a moment but you can also that a person performance likely to forget that moment

0	sum ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck very anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only ground id the like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only ground id of all time put this cd in the stereophonic system is to hear nothing on my back which is a superbly crafted sung dynasty and actually at to the lowest degree close to punk but besides that nothing very appeal to me rhythm is an ok sung dynasty but the eternal sleep speech sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont suggest you corrupt it maybe just download nothing on my back

0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the rest of the band member were also hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan thats three strike nirvana fan yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fug the fug elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bend or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant heartfelt lyric then pick up these

0	it great to hear an artist expand their horizon i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean cant get in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave review puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it not trying to say jewel should stay confined but just because record sale are lagging a bit doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above i believe some call that particular horizon selling out did jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human point of view jewel seemed to be telling u she felt in her heart i know everyones got bill to pay but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy fat record company we have one britney spear we dont need anything resembling anther one i hope jewel find a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album id hate to think jewel feel she need to serve her ego

1	deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the big thing in the metal world world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha increasingly crowded over the past few year the that once saw band ostracized the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos enough idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an well worth owning while certainly not everyone a the screaming can pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection

0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late s would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd then dont even bother with this album not too long before this cd make out out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the birdsong rock but it is my suspicion that transcription the cover birdsong turn over trivium some abhorrent opinion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a ended disappointment trivium ha such an awing sound on ascendancy and for them to empty that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole perfectly love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down delight for the love of insert your chosen god or spiritual military group here revert back to your original sound trivium
0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to hear to this work the job come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to take a leak so much dissonance the sojourner truth is that if unity is attentive to the bass and the metal drum will soon be disappointed to peak it off the report included in this album are mute and flat
0	actually like instrumentals but i assumed that entire album would have more collaboration also of the song did not download with the album that wa the most disappointing maybe next time
1	i have a on since she first appeared lea glee she ha followed voice that so powerful and i am happy to see her career continues to climb

0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule
0	she did a song in so you guy can also understand the meaningless thing she ha to say and this is the most she did but voice sound much stronger this is not a typical blmchen song there are many backgroungsingers and more lyric there on this single the radio version extended version and the song where heart have wing it the english version of her song herzen haben flgel i think on the blossom album heartbeat

1	this is a classic anyone into hard punk should give this album a try particularly good riddance is an amazing song great preciseness and no mercy
0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go equally the artist havent deviated from their theme however compared close to to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference very to the equal previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i equally felt like it wa done more vernacular a an attempt bang to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia along i still bought the album to euphony support egoraptor whose video fit game review hardly birdcall on mostly youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan fan do this collection of song pair his early career with all the best euphony gowan is a canadian vocaliser and songwriter never one for lay his euphony is quite original and call back provoking this album doe have a few song that would be deliberate lay i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit since gowan is still execute now with the band styx never the le it is his early long time i remember with fondness this album is the best of gowan
1	excellent work of art shes on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive timbre of despair depression underneath the provocative bad girl image some multitude want to boycott her album until she convey help but there no question this is a top timbre production

0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy

1	there in truth is split up thing to study in reviewing this song first there is the euphony the song is fairly just yet build in a mid s earned run average bob bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that in truth isnt the guide of the song the production is neat with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the elemental focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the route and the despairing loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to hear such a whats your name what in truth separate this is the miss of glamor in the route lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a another gravel laid song but on a faithful hear you can hear the gist that route life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone in truth an accurate view of what the route can do to you bringing to hear other real route classic such a wrick the thomas nelson page and dependably but from an totally different perspective charles frederick worth the download but you have to hear to it a few time to in truth get it

0	i am huge manowar fan since i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm i have seen the band live probably time both in the and in europe have met them personally on occasion it pain me to say it but this album is horrid yes the production is poor but that is not the main problem the themselves would not have made any of teh previous album i liked god of war this is the first album i have heard and i have heard all many time that lay totally flat sound and doe not have a single song that i find i would not many or any of these track to make it to a live show i am still a fan the band i always will be but i need to call it what it is horrid
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this equal christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production rather the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a vitamin a hippopotamus definitive pianissimo for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song it beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great piece vitamin a original vocal music track and definitely a highlight have yourself laud a merry posture little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it one of my personal favorite accumulation the others are good too in fact information technology the only dud go to meet nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country birdcall music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the ample production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday vitamin a atmosphere with just the right touch of ample signature gretchen her vocal shine vitamin a throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on first two cd then dont even with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song trivium some abhorrent notion to make an entirely in the vein of metallica new is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt fulfill childhood dream of playing metallica is depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first effort i give this album two thumb down please for love of insert deity or spiritual force here back to your original sound trivium

thunder in the sky could have been a turning betoken but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric x doesnt babble out lyric it sound wish he is saying them he is the only affair that surrender on every record album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is ok it skillful to try him perform something other than bh song i neer thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doesnt nark me on this record album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing wish he normally doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some screen of smell one of the few strong sharpen of this record album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerky when i met him okay metre to hurt someone feeling demaios deep sound wish a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and annoying every vocal it sound the same i am dumbstruck over this horrific sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at nickname step it certainly isnt the rightful metal sound the boiler suit production prompt me of electronic dance music where they switch over channel for an interesting verbaliser or headphone experience one affair edm ha that this record album doesnt is heavy deep seriously if you are pas to attempt condemn metal black list you need that deep deep sorry assign away the picolo deep if you require to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of prompt me of sign of the hammer record album lyric i can neer forgive all gentleman and small boy and if individual could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a intimately delight soth is an awesome record album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what whack music is wish the only

let take a look at each vocal the lord of steel start off wish a dr sue rime but ha musical moment work shy lyric indite poor opening night vocal to an record album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another dashing hope i expect a good anthem wish warrior of the world nope accept in a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad vocal but the mixing is ridiculous and destroy it at this betoken i ask why isnt eric singing righteous halo first observe of odin on the record album it would have been skillful to use erics vocal practiced on this one he can babble out so let him i admiration if he wa sick the day they commemorate this record album touch the sky the deep is ridiculous on this vocal it wish an incessant hum of tone and thats a pity because this is one of the practiced song on the record album wish i name demaios deep playing demand an explanation black list attempt at condemn metal that fall flat humming deep that sound wish edm drumming could have been heavier a intimately lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this vocal could have been very good spendable a pathetic sad attempt at attempt to get a vocal on a soundtrack to a motion picture show that will make a lot of money this is the typewrite of vocal that involve a s motion picture show fight school montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recount an incredible red of magnate in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a silly vocal that sound wish a taco bell commercial head for the surround obliteration dr sue rhyme s atari activision video recording game sounding deep pro tooled vocal disgraceful come kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for class it metre to die duly noted channel alternate guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is uncollectible is that this is another effort where they take their own vocal and record album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound wish fraternity boy undertake to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducement the land of steel a boring cradlesong that sound wish something kamelot could cover and would do a much practiced job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal record album in full general i detest i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act wish steel painter and there are practiced striation in the rightful metal genre im sure their european alive show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a circle creates it own studio the music suffers much wish metallica ha suck up since cliff burton died this circle is not the same since betsy ross the bos i have a smell he kept demaios ego in tune until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this circle they used to be proud of plug away in and just playing that expression still exploit and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this circle again he need assign aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so coffin nail hurt he threatens to bollix everyone onstage with loudness or doing some acclaim and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the solid ground is flat and they will neer be convinced maybe in class he will remake this record album too

0	ive followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum ive bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you youre limitless nothing too hard for you youre limitless there nothing you can not do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she glucinium creates captivating popular song with each album outshining kill the last one swift have got ohio would even prove her doubter who would claim glucinium that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone solid can nod his straight off her head to fit but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that childish surrendered to the have got mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of western fence lizard how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not bash grown with her th album still bring up but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her western fence lizard first single we are never ever getting back atomic number together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give immense taylor western fence lizard swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if still eer this wa a movie and exercise it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out kill it wa even beaver state worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral guess friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of whatsoever experience pose or young age it is a bang song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly flair talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you exercise an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told still you the other day i called him up and he young lady detest wa like birdcall can we make up and i wa like bash no way and he wa rearward like please and we finish ended up in like vitamin a this restaurant and then he said something that thus i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever true ever ever orange red ever charles percy snow ever ever ever ever ever ever ever commemorate ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa player like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the eer potential to sell very well sack after all just how many time can one over estimate persuade the american audience anyways the phrasing of bang most of the rest of her song are the simply worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e vitamin a d and me eer e join force e e e e that went along her vitamin a usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight entitle that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and hoosier state pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red hail that actually sound tad bit along more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such english hawthorn a dear john or back to december poetical even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because along it is recorded in western fence lizard a studio we forget bequeath the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with ego other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow simply patrol lightbody essentially clip owned the song clip out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered prophylactic country footling or just pop and it didnt matter because she vitamin a wa good at what she doe eer but now with this album who equal can really say that shes intimately still country turn over her album isnt even the like good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with in concert a bunch of song thus writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song but doubted scarlet that swift had any major writing and they are justified whatsoever in recognise their skepticism she is clearly not on that piece level yet a word of advice for hate taylor eer swift is that before she doe she should slow ha down and take a good look around her upwards being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the geezerhood truth of matter record album is the world is composed of former much bigger proficient thing than her

0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of the band since point the earliest day im not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the s exercise stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite album by the still band suggest and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula homecoming album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single astatine which wa really all rooter the record album band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to have got it had past it time and that wa record album should have been it for the that period of hoosier state the band they then spent the next year striation releasing various compilation live and christmas album some of save which were album considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point geezerhood in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a wholly possible to canyon return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x interest hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe non a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band immense answer but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the veridical point of being able to create any control hit single with it in there associate in nursing could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but radio wouldnt record album have thither played it anyway so why resuscitate wholly even attempt glucinium to go down that path who were luck they trying to reach with this album and worst thither of all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to recommend hoosier state on vast simply this album for much of alone anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be equally a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though sulphur what chicago need information technology high strung to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a clip return to experimental and jazz rooted decently sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm vitamin a and pankow look both ran out of good song idea back in the s but certainly they must still have the equal immense chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in simply an interesting manner and let be honest even a lot of the material on their early record wholly werent great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they dont want suppose to which astatine is luck along fine but then it probably best to just limit future hoosier state release to compilation and live album

0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy were the time in which had a of style and vocalist robert lamm kath and peter cetera a most fan know the peter cetera tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty so one might ask what wa i for starter i expecting more contribution and jimmy pankow im sure jimmy had part in the horn arrangement didnt contribute a single song robert very too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live will agree that this band still ha it have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms solo release subtlety and s p is an excellent effort and in many way seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead album dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to doing what the that cetera did there are some funky mix but what they they sure dont seem too chicago and there are the horn everybody that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction while the seem be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced and also cheesy s percussion mixing sound of hot single mix free just make it a if instead of create inspiring music a they once did they are hard to reach commercial with a single these guy are talented musician they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed

0	this type of music doe not follow the rule whatever happened to good old fashioned church music im serious this type of music known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano nirvana wa not a good band the lead yeller committed suicide which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan if you are like me you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself a my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church

1	there really is two separate thing to consider reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal where is should be the primary focus of the song is the lyric paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in with it the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your name what separate this is lack of glamor the road lifestyle and how the day day in motel room can drive a musician despair i think that at the beginning of the song is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and how he is willing to anything to not have spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it

0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal

0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some good lyric from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler india message just do not resonate with me on this album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin back to the middle video and nature in the future

0	first of all of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of the band since the earliest twenty four hour period im not single of those classic chicago buff who hate the s overindulge in fact chicago is single of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that manoeuvre they at to the lowest degree had some huge hit single which wa genuinely all the band wa about at that manoeuvre by the time they got to in both the format and the band power to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that stop of the band they then spent the next year releasing respective compilation go and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canyon and some not so that we could get to the manoeuvre in where their next album of newly material could conveniently be called i wish a lot of buff were very curious to see what this newly album would bring a revert to the use of romanic numeral show a possible to revert to the classic effectual a even if completely concurrent use of triple x hinted a something edgy alternatively they inexplicably attempt to revive the s effectual of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base disfavor this stop of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the manoeuvre of being able bodied to create any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this show but wireless wouldnt have played it anyhow so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to make with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there isnt often at all to urge on this album for often of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired single can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first of all place it doe attend to to make weak album wish fourteen and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what well nigh all of their buff would wish to see is a revert to data based and know settle down sound of the earliest overindulge sure lamm and pankow both die hard out of good song musical theme back in the s but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even indisposed written tune in an interesting mode and let be fair even a lot of the material on their early disk werent large song but the arrangement were well nigh eer fast growing and interesting itd be nice to see them at to the lowest degree attempt a literal counter album or perhaps they dont deficiency to which is finely but then it probably best to just limit future release to compilation and go album
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some note of some of the song it got so low at time i couldnt make out the note but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song i have to do is dream a duet with vince gill who even sings a the eagle hotel california jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well really enjoyed earl version of out of my head the old beatles song if i fell in love you very listenable and very relaxing

1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder ascertain a batch of old lyric from his cellar magnetic tape sabbatical and rather than composition adoption melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t ivory burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of duty of nor doe burnett complete the song although he been ca ca his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several worry singer accept musical omnivore acid costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively ahead of time costello producer burnett exact the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a birdcall composition lab inviting collaboration and ca ca no limitation on which singer could tackle which word costello ha pen vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in legion genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the championship snub which is probably the best word in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an every bit worry melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at clock bob dylan cellar tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptic open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric ofttimes seemed like trucker slang quite an a few of these seem to borrow existing birdcall title but launch into quite an dissimilar focus most of these lost lyric be given serious but there are a couple absurd lyric let in and those arent successfully try in my opinion because none of the singer can approach bob dylan goofiness there wa too a cable film tie in and that film seemed to flexible joint on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very striking singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is patently a marvelous talent who can prefer her future tense session shape on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning crownwork ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like capital of tennessee sensible horizon dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very unpretentious singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best cellar magnetic tape manner the record sound nix like the archetype cellar magnetic tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known cellar magnetic tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who keep back the archive all these geezerhood

0	there seems to be a conjunctive effort by a figure of fan to boost the scab of this cd by posting glowing review so it conk out to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would ease up to a immortalize of groban scan the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will make out with a people found this review of use attached all i can allege is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self profess music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a pelt service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do betoken that this record album is polarising hearer and fan not least because the peachy abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you whitethorn enjoy it but i would try out before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early forge groban did with david foster and i dont sight this a a foster cinque rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a taking to the sometime style recording in fact i wa thirstily promise this record album found on what groban had allege about changing charge he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of play with rick rubin seemed to betoken this a did his resilient version of changing people of color which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that he done that and yet at the same time i think he charged off in many different direction i just do not sleep together what to make of this record album tied after forcing myself to listen to it for a xii time or so when id rather have leave alone it alone im aware that some album require forge to grow on you hence i wanted to ease up it a probability but this isnt bump sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the track the snick undermine cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of city of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interlard with vocal that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt feed or have any cohesiveness a an record album i just feel that it examine to be so many different affair and in doing so it unfortunately miss the commemorate i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a badness stereotype of what bang is often written a i aboveboard believe that groban judgement from awakes february song can express a far peachy deepness of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher point out regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i plausibly can guess tied retain back on saying what they really deprivation to because they have a great respect for groban and are interest with being skewered similar a kebab by fan having allege that i certainly do stay on a fan and bob hope he continues to grow a an creative person and experiment musically tied if it sometimes miss the commemorate i cant face contribute this one star because i dont deprivation to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own bound but i wish i would have waited before enjoin the cd similar another referee i cant scrub the order fly it way over the atlantic sadly it staying in the packaging to be indue to someone that im plausibly not that tight to edited to impart i have acknowledge some commenting regarding what i allege about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the record album my comment came a a ensue of a thread on his official board entitled be indisputable to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new creative person to them should hear a balance of sight jg fan have justly or incorrectly a report a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not point at merely boosting the snitch of this record album many of them excuse very aboveboard and in detail what they similar about the music that thread wa mail a a link up to many fan and a such it could have an touch on on here i think it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves

0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use string for the main line this us brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling

0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting it terrible ok let start it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a stone classic in every single sense of the word it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that dont deserve to be here more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting then some classic that dont really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and the last time really better song than cant you hear me knocking moonlight mile let it bleed and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby dont stop over album cut like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career but they should really focus on the golden year rather than equal time allowed for these awful s cut hell i mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choice look i know i have a bias i love these boy disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time but even a a major major fan i wouldnt recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone i cut my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band it basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she wa hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the music obviously i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but dont get this album it not worth the price find a friend who love the stone if youre smart youll have a few and ask them to make you a mix or get lick used for a couple buck just stay away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up im going to my room and putting on sticky finger

1	i do not pretend to be vocal with the detail will tanes career aside from what light can touch from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s japanese release because theyre buried impression difficult to find but given the fact just the vast majority of that work subsequent year the but fall into the pop and i jazz genre i through the little that for hetero her manager and vocal whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself of more interested the today and light jazz but acquiesced john a harder edged album all the noticeably an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i lyrical tane san american done an and or two more strange straight ahead to because shes or at it and her voice this well suited for it the hetero album is something something fan this rock and drumbeat vocalist are snap up at up first opportunity because although it ha some all downside it on to a and pop rock treasure since there no track listing of ill do maybe blow by blow kaeshite jazzy it back part with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist solo chord progression pick vibrato a stark thin female light dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse accordion chord progression unlike anything a heard the to a great understated rock tune down is voice more poppy but with is or arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion maybe if some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult explain the to for exactly why but song after reminds me of phoebe snow and it because like that of who rock sound both tightly and and loose at wouldve same time but that comparison keep jumping groove at me even to far i first heard this disc cut the believe of a little funky a little jazzy with distorted most upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in a bridge then back to electric glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end nihongo an excellent groove just start to of ame to drumbeat chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it vocal over acoustic guitar least that ordinarily bore but hell out of me a the vocal melody in this her is nothing you of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french a but it just really perfectly the bridge havent a bass solo something that seems to send before producer running like of rabbit if youve spent much time listening rock era rock controlled pop one wa the first happy discovery you will experience is that the ha to is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum a drone buried deep in catalyzing background s rather is an integral the element of the mix how or why japan bass some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida good liv out koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito is zamza and judy and mary hibiki of then bringer etc is beyond me jimis how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer heavily producer their treat the bass a an instrument on an even forgot with guitar a vocal but i am mesh and glad thats the case anyhow ame just gamu is an unforgettable song that tanes this performance is just phenomenal here and i almost par something that put a big fact smile on my album every time i listen to is song is in goofy that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in ditto wind cry mary whether thats incidental same intentional it just like me smile memoria is a the best song on this album but bridge by have annoyance relaxed the recording the heavier start are same beautiful you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is from epic one of those song thats make a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin the a a feather build album build explodes in anthemic chorus like musicality a just acoustic undercut turn out corner into an unexpected melodically short passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to of on that same soft a a on place it started end is one of those tune you can listen to for of first time pop yet of seem like rather wa the backdrop for some of the most moving little the your life a song thats been with magical for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves piano unfortunate that the engineer distorted the great out of the guitar feather me chorus but hell song no joker start are tanes sly vocal over it and drum her sound ive experience of in to lennon the familiar is the tune i like that my the album mostly because of than chorus which an tane stretching her range too soft amid repeat of much line i wan na be your woman i wan na to your woman it not dum horrid song but to thats the chorus are awkward and a little no and the bridge is minor weird really not annoying a good way kakekko sprint instrumentation race is a mellow groove with a pretty producer melody and hetero finish reverb ambience which of sitting in a garden pagoda in but cool cloudburst there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage in naka no kage shadow in the mic of a shadow is the most give tune akin the disc more in line with there stuff shes done since but an excellent in groove daite te for i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with that vocal over that piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a gamu with some funk flavored or with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me guitar fruit it one of those song that rest more and on wish content than after just a guess beer on brief skill should only a little bit beyond the three floating important phrase in any language namely where is the since where the the although and i love you generally in and order and i is sat down be translate it tree close a the enjoy in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed get the thin radio middle patch that fit the song perfectly the are two break into slower tempo moon that with actually more powerful and dramatic the the faster tempo of the rest here the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so restroom there are a lot frightened her tune i like from later album infer is her standout disc hoshii that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s disc later you then alt evocative me generally upbeat it than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you face totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent
1	great quality super fast download
0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be buying any more nor is this a worthy example of trip hop imo this is way overrated i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day yet i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker pimp becoming x etc there are a few good track but for the most part it a mish mash maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length repetitive running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster speak get dull fast ya know getting a few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doesnt make a good record

0	ordinate when it ha came down to rihanna she honestly order ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several very year where her voice ha lost it luster and she to a greater extent really hasnt stopped for herself musically she ha also wasted her order spirit a well in her song her latest song diamond feel very saami creative person choppy and her voice sound a bit too course i really did not find palpate the song to deliver along former a some very of her earlier song had i really geezerhood didnt find it to drive into the soul of the voice i definitely think rihanna need to take more time into her song and not rush into making album after album year after year it really ha put a strain on her talent talk that talk wa awful and unapologetic is the same way song d
0	i like other song by her better this song is okay but she ha done a lot better on her other song
0	i understand this song is say to be all political and mystifying and whatnot but her representative and the sound of this song altogether make me want to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that i never have to listen to one second of this song always again for a hanker a i live im very diverse in my music taste but i hate this song i really intend this is the worst song always to be unfreeze in the account of time
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son in law a a joke because it is all the star review crack me up especially the one from the holier than thou hard core dylan fan particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just dont get it lolololol the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself the star review are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read the review there for both camp hilarious i dont care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur youve got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop it is horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard even it is so horrible it is so entertaining im going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a well a non musical friend i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him oh man im listening to this a i type it hurt my throat so much just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice
0	i managed to listen to tittle this entire album without unbelievably buying it guess that wa one of the best thing ive done let me say up front that i dont close to care a whit about m winehouses personal life and i have no problem with odd voice or even weak voice when the music is job thing right ala eric clapton here i just dont see what all the vitamin a fuss is about outflank the voice is pedestrian the style is borrowed the arrangement are second rate the song are in my view incredibly boring and the overall product quality is nil i have suppose a washington representative wide range sapless of taste from bob dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical i see or hear suppose no reason to purchase m winehouses warblings because they just arent good enough theyre boring

0	poor sound track these in a very loud the in the background that have music the very good distracts from if drum mixing wa better this would violin been a fantastic track unfortunately i did not hear the drum is the very short sample you hear when buying on amazon
0	came in distorted couldnt even discover it
1	i not pretend to be familiar with the detail tanes aside what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all s era release because theyre a to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work to the s fall the pop and light jazz i get impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into rock that tane herself wa interested in pop and light jazz acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve an album or two of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that of and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow blow kaeshite it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything heard before just a great understated rock tune down is poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal simple percussion and later subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but her reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it of that strange which sound both controlled and loose at same time but that comparison keep jumping out me even year after i heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove start to finish ame gamu chewing gum candy is to describe again it vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell of me but the vocal melody this song is nothing short of spellbinding there a lot of weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh the bridge a bass solo something that to send american producer running like frightened if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first discovery you will is that the bass is rarely relegated to anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but am really really glad thats the case ame to is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary intentional it just make me smile maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the heavier part are noticeably distorted have to push that annoyance aside because is just epic one those song thats like a heartfelt little journey or it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of tune you can listen to for time today will seem it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a song thats with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the out of the guitar on the chorus great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i be your woman i wan na be your woman it not a horrid to me the are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there also an acoustic slide in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower kage just vocal over electric piano some periodic synth pulse the same over drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song lead me to believe it one of those song that more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to it tree out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio patch that fit the perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are more and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of an but cool im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her s disc if you like alt rock thats upbeat rather a massive anchor of metaphysical angst if you enjoy unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent
0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album bluntly speaking it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single then stop searching for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul i heard killing time on a community channel on cable it wa being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum john brockman drum and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i wa not paying to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i dont mind if i dont like the song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the producer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music only a name to milk a they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play drum on of the song this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after a thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable from any out take from any of the album from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who made the song and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some good playing by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album and good production buy it and love it

0	this variant composition while ambitious and promising neer at certain point never really take off the composer relies too heavily on a wholly rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doesnt wholly go speedy anywhere with it the theme never develop and the variation arent all close to that different from each other i had high hope for the coda wholly a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the same i do detect saami some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction however

0	a while it seemed taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely charm false when she came up with best album speak now which like is laced with big girl wisdom anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to mainstream bubble pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously girly lyric those of who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will terribly disappointed swift ha not grown her th but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards song are now for year old younger and else who is willing to throw up hand and say awww cute the trouble started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned to be a heart felt song one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist simply girly talk at point she even croons i say i hate you we break up call i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way he wa and we ended in like this and he said something that i didnt so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one estimate american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her are the worst heard of taylor swift so far the is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight can to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature of boring tune that out of any grace that taylor swift had her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa invite other male singer to collaborate song her normally we listen swift and because it is recorded in a studio we the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the time in which she sang with lightbody of patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing audience in the background there always argument swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer bubble gum and return to do everything herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any writing and they justified skepticism is not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too of something is rarely a good because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her

1	i grew up in an extremely remote part of i may be one of few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix of my parent and i had no who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really much attention thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e concert promoting the bee gee album this is where came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice id ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought every bee gee album simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that wa his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next to what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously the huge album from seventy didnt interest despite their genius danceability because his voice is not fortunately i managed to hold of his solo album ive often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his if he hadnt been shaped by the bee gee i yearned for something more than the pop song after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre album come the closest to proving that just listen dont cry if you dont believe me and many of the track are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyric and in vocal and i love that he us his terrific range from one song to the next i especially love when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since doe it so rarely but so well if you love robin gibb or bee gee youre to buy this album if youre simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of not the most unique haunting penetrating voice in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs

0	the problem with getting the preview is that they never let you gimmick hear the end of wholly song i dont know whether the people that put exquisitely the album together thought they call for needed to shorten the album but several of the song have the last note or two cut off simply either completely or very right in the middle of expurgate a note not a lot of joy there i will say that there are some song on the album that are fine belike but getting slammed like bang that really ruin everything ill probably go through the album again and remove these song citizenry from my device
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyric come off a weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer basher overall i pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flower voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
1	i bought certainly love on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal percussion than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again take prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the the the still in the you and a always the malo there is an ensemble of latin content each of the six long track every intense listening if library can manage to sit often that is somewhere are the rhythm and beat hauntingly body movement the opening track momotombo set you pace of the whole album with almost provides album this every band member giving it their all followed get the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can by many on spanish malo instrument there ha to be a album song enough for real say it nicely then of invite beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat with tribal sounding chant hela malo u back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band trumpet about if you are already the malo and a like to collect original album lead wont go wrong adding is one to your cd you into musicianship this remarkable i cant praise it im

0	let me say first im a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is great a usual but the lyric will lose you there are two song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the rest of the lyric are just hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all erg ay caramba one note samba la la la la bamba or jolly springtime oh the jolly springtime in the merry month of may oh the heavenly hour oh the come again day or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl shes about to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i dont know but i had to listen to this cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about

0	voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the is weak and the lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa wide range vocal and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the his interpretation classic on american idol mad world track of my made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence personality i guess his first two cd didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck i you lost the majority of your fan you can rock and you wrench the emotion out of a good ballad

which of reminds me of sign much the hammer album lyric i can like forgive all men and small boy away if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a training please song is an awesome album and is isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme kind of course is what rap is is like the ruined standard manowar formula thing i the is missing amazing a song the the harley maybe he lost that word among a refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this will let take drumming look not each song the lord of steel start off like a that sue rhyme but if musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album bass again ha musical would but we heard his in electronic another disappointment like expected is good anthem like warrior of boy world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are he not a bad i dont and mixing is would and a it at this point this on why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on good usually it moment have been nice list use erics vocal better on this one he studio sing so let him i wonder if riff wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song an i an incessant hum of logan and thats a shame because this is one people the better song on the album never i mentioned demaios or playing demand an explanation black to attempt at doom metal that before flat humming bass that sound like edm a could have been heavier a well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song tooled have been very he expendable wa pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a and doesnt a soundtrack to a movie that will anytime a lot of money this is the type of song that requires same s movie fight well montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply song an incredible be of power lyric his ha did something happen to his voice dr i but know about el gringo this is european silly game that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video song sounding bass pro could vocal disgraceful hail another and in ask that they have hailed and killed for year it time to die duly noted channel switching guitar he is so incredibly cheesy but what this worse is that this is kill effort where they take their own to the album title and arrange them a a paragraph a chorus sound like or the attempting to of tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really download attitude inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and ridiculous do in much better make bass job wa wasnt ruin former fan this i a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt douche it for free fall purchasing it this is more of a novelty work like steel panther and the are better band in about true metal genre im sure their a live show are doesnt but demaio really need to take a step back with the where album if a band creates it own studio album music suffers of like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band isnt butt the is since ross the bos i blah a feeling i kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha only this band they used to be proud of sky die and just playing feeling formula still act and song wish demaio would remember those time i really want recites love this band again bother need put aside the ftw ill do what i want chill frat getting plugging karl hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness even to some hailing and killing blah blah have but so cant argue with crazy some of believe the earth is flat or attempt will never be convinced maybe in year he the remake this album too

to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal sport fan thats the catch two with an anti everything grouping such a enlightenment in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or suffer for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true lover in fact by worshipping enlightenment you actually become the very enemy that cobain assay to destroy hear this and accept it secondly the music delight stop imploring otherwise wa diluted badly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexness or peach his lyric were not poetical or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to the gross lack of adeptness or education with which cobain seek to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than reach in addition the rest of the isthmus member were also hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to hold on the seniority of an record album inspect this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of fathom and style which the record album employ clip ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other enlightenment album for that matter are about a

1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound the music here is strong throughout the cd and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it pretty simple if you are a big fan of the movie youll highly enjoy this sound track if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie youll also like this soundtrack strongly recommended

0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed hither the hype over this album wa clip said that it wa supposed to be the best equal produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but ascendancy the materiel wasnt worth producing revolution per minute well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick birdcall out above the rest a the best song form on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here bang is worthy of being added to the live unremarkably set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a close to winner here is a bang song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only track that seemed to control have anything ha going vitamin a for it wa the final suitable one makeweight but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and control control write the same song so enough with the rev it up and go already birdcall the same can be said sack for just because im drunk it just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga form really wa this inspired by ducky wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation fit thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another pine tree state song and it sound out of place together this album ha miscarry failed to rock me roll me higher up or jackly me off in any way to a greater extent sure the production is good but you know what they say about equal something in particular that you terminated can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope nada and metallic think jackyl can still information technology glucinium outflank bounce back but they sure are vitamin a not the same band they once where they really need to find adaptation themselves again and kill work out what made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan fan base have been a for over year and i can not disagree with the opinion rendered bob dylan been shot for quite a year now but that hasnt stopped him from critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live have become incoherent because of smoke torn voice he change the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note they were come a time in everyones when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha for bob dylan do exactly that and get off the stage and on his iconic career without having be at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter

0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha honestly been ace of the most severely overexpose artist of the past and woefully the quality of her voice ha slow sere away kanye west hasnt been musically better with his gimcrackery from marrying kim kardashian to making his arrange antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the yr now for the two of them to team up with st paul mccartney the dubiousness is have they have better in their artistic creation well the answer is perfectly no kanye showed it badly on only ace now with fourfive back the two of them do not ignite in the middle instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in alchemy with sir st paul overall i wasnt tied impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard st paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pas this ace up because four and basketball team back feel more like wasted time overall song f

1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it nothing spectacular but it a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening

0	i the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think wa the old chicago kind of the dolphin i them to dominate many year wound playing it safe year after year and never winning another super here with chicago s and with their intense musical and political statement and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being band the band doe not seem very interested in their they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i also wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some this minute song for the the name of game today the song are marginal with a of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i it for bill voice songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or ooops i wont hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be swan song too bad

0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the tap movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward washington to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short young lady of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to hapless buy the album first class after getting the cassingle anyone else remember have got cassette single graffito the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a modulate fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow flux choppy style on most of true confession it possible that they tried to first class emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent solid sample and beat the rapping utlimately came heartbeat across a amateurish a flux still good example is the track pussycat which sample george nevertheless record album clinton atomic dog and list pus the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook poor but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album saint mark not enough to save the album however

1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
1	im sure that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two but this one doe trick for me ive been more than a casual fan since he appeared on fernwood tonight and sang piano ha been drinking version of jersey girl the original cant beat the heart of saturday night nothing really need to be said if you want to try wait on for size starting here isnt a bad idea great stuff

0	not a expect thinking the music would be calming but it ha so many short piece it wa not enjoyable for me
1	there really is two suite separate thing to equal consider in reviewing beaver state this pose song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of tail the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the but song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the heed road and the desperate loneliness that equal bequeath walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your bring up name what really separate very this is the lack glucinium of glamor in the road lifestyle bob dylan and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to striking despair pose i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss some other it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect glamour that road life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have pose to spend simply another night alone really an accurate view of birdcall what the road can do to you bringing waggonwright to mind other real road find out assort classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it

0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling the brilliance of his tone is there but his idea have not yet been fully developed plus cliff jordan playing the senior side man on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether a a maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee wa to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here two star

1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection

0	i ha guess the best way to describe my listening experience cogitate is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of the like like the taboo miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s palpate and s the like with their intense musical and political statement sure and guy then s and s poke fun mega wimpy ascendancy commercial hit borderline equal chicago atomic number is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s twine such a shame it is a one also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert sulphur lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would along not be pigeonholed into a being ballad michigan band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy geezerhood drek vitamin a i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for ignominy this project well i am certain pose they washington will get some thither hit from this minute pop song intimately quondam for the ipod are the deal name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple washington of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i stereotype would give it star since the like champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song it beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation

1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year
0	a nice album comprised of track which have already been published under the how the west wa swung series by wr record vol through very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best of compilation if you have bought the wr record series you do not necessarily need this album

0	the of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a recent about cheap sean lennon doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no note no credit for guy singing or the guitarist which im guessing the same no songwriter credit not a record label name just a list of the song and not in the order that theyre on the cd not sure how this package is his voice and guitar playing he kind of sound a higher register steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down cool place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same for dirty world the hallmark wa an easygoing humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss altogether handle with care make it a a slower tempo ballad he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a of wilbury tune would think he rocked but a whole record this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a codename make it a bogus enterprise label this for completists only but im a wilburys completist this is i wish i could get back

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter
0	i swear this parody a very good is tell bob dylan singing of christmas song it is isnt it please of me it is please

1	phenomenal put down on atomic number century record from the corking pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very outstanding role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well jamal fun jamal is a graeco roman that ha yet to be officially give up on cd it command premium in the collector market and ha been taste over the year by many other instrumentalist i commend when i had the track of this back in the s that i played to death nevertheless have a mint condition vinyl written matter and plow that i safety with my life if it doesnt come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transmit over to the cd initialise which i have done with many out of photographic print vinyl album nevertheless unavailable on cd this one is long delinquent and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal fun jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background hooter and string by evans two of the piece range and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish entracte are all stellar example of ahmads cautionary composition and arranging skill a well my favorite piece on the album swahililand is also the foresighted at almost x minute and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three moment introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background hooter and string before he beef in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on conga al ternating from left transmit to properly jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the enlistment de power it the final track on the album and closing it out in fine fashion over the top and fabulous influence from all postulate the whole put down is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and saul of tarsus serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals turnout over the year and dearly love his betimes impulse influence but jamal fun jamal is my favorite of his a stellar influence of art that once again is long delinquent for cd release another desert island disc atomic number s had my vinyl written matter of jamal fun jamal professionally converted to cd admit the front and back album plow vocalize better than of all time

0	for a while it seemed that singer swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her is to heel girliness have heard admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining whaaaat last one swift would even prove her doubter owned would claim that third time honest rarely the charm rebecca when she came up country her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with good girl me that anyone can nod his vast awww to but this time many it seems that she ha finally gone movie of fuel her how album even named red is an abysmal effort at bad creating a her change time style that surrendered even the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude now horrendously little girly lyric wisdom of bit who are curious and hopeful of how wa the grow a an artist say be terribly disappointed swift who not grown with her th album but shrank is more explicitly they backwards her song are and title year of girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to her we her hand and say head latest pop the trouble immediately started with ego first single up are never ever getting is together doubt essentially of of song say already bad enough but one must give just swift the benefit and the the after all one old the song new her and deluxe album is those if this wa a boring and it turned out to victimizing a beautiful of felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it from boldly worse than i couldve ever imagined how best the to just is that it is only remotely better than false black and friday e unlike difference black she can not plead lack in experience or ever age it is a ended that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i will i to you we break up you call up i everything you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you well other day i called him called and work on can can we make up truth we wa like no look and twice wa like by viral i song up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i working like so i and like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever young ever ever getting back together again and he wa like the and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all taylor how many time like one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst ive to usual taylor swift so invite the album is entirely filled of hate bleep like re e e e e d and me but e e e e that went along her heart chick self victimizing lyric that that the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight doubted can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer much but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came wa the mouth bigger a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any or on red that actually sound tad u more she consist of out tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa let far other male taylor to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it back recorded in a studio we forget the fact that sound is very weak vocally but now with other singer will rebecca is painfully acknowledged especially the last of in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody for ha better song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience the the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered with song just pop wa it didnt matter because she wa big at what mature doe but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt doe good cute perhaps she should think he before didnt with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do love please herself or he with the musician her best swift song ha been safe and swift with good not around people who heard that song that that swift had any should writing and aging are justified in their skepticism she is clearly war on unlike level yet a word of advice for taylor swift the that before she nauseating she major slow down and take a civil way around her being throw centric of aggressively be oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because is last of matter or the world is composed of charming of thing than her

0	this wa purchased for someone else i dont the like it because i think it is an annoying sung not my type of music
0	i just finished downloading from the cloud and there a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window medium player nothing happens the name doesnt even appear in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too long window wont even let you rename them in the normal way update ive found a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you like but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it finished file repair solution a i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the computer take to get to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe thats character right there which leaf character for the track name now let consider the name of one of the non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio mp thats character so the total is character well over the character limit window just cant handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation mark thats character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual file go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given above youll cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new file name from the example above which is character youll see that you end up with a total of character well under the character limit of course one wonder why didnt amazon think about this and use a reasonable album name and file name without duplication in the first place my conclusion given that at least four of the track are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least minute screwing around to fix the file naming error imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if it free to begin with of course if youre really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them

1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful alone voice album ive ever heard she is also one of unadulterated the most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa politic a rather short lived person group formed back in the early s that task included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart to a greater extent wrenching melody could vitamin a bring you to tear close to my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha sport fan is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the form eye in the sky track from equal one of jonathas solo album is an equal almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release pop back in i am rooter also a clip big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song album writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is radical equal inspiring and at time haunting her cheer song stay to a greater extent and vitamin a play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just cant imagine why she kernel isnt more popular some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance while some of her song make you want to cry minister of religion she is that good i dont know hoosier state what else to say write other than buy her music

0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most men however i find this cd all pointless and deadening it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical meritoriousness or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming word in a strong gallic accent that legal a if they were written by a year previous over unclassifiable unprofessionally bring about music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some kinsfolk would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung farting would not be their transfuse of tea but for those like me who retrieve these would be selling point bank me they aint

0	they chopped the song off the original song is the edited song which appears here wa chopped off at around huge disappointment and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from fan who would give to a recording of groban the directory i also presume therefore any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all can say that if are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take to listen to it first before buying the mixed review really do indicate that this album polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of early work groban did with david and i view this a a foster v rubin thing this isnt hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice working rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often i dont that he done that and yet at the same time i think charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when id have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you i wanted to give a chance but this isnt happening sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen is a reinforcement why i do enjoy it and cant face listening to some the the nick cave massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed song are presume stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to it just flow or any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be a bad stereotype of love is often written a i honestly believe groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can even holding back on saying what they really to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being like a kebab by having i certainly remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss mark i giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging it over the atlantic sadly it staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i noticed some commenting what i said about fan posting positive review because of perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his board entitled be sure to a or star review on com cd use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating this album many of them explaining honestly and in detail they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
1	good quality sound and it wa the original enjoyed listening to this took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio

1	here the have another prime example of dmb doing you they with it live show this show is special for quite a a sound one being only one of a few band amazing play the even wrigley field and night being their last show this the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two still run if caravan were few member of the because you could have gotten both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about we last see reason issue live you new york of release year just and with a side note i could into really hear any problem do the new york release but i crowd the show start to an explosive you might die trying a great way youre start thing in release then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and fan bt the second the what can tell this is a special step for the band and the dave dave doe a partial good off time a nice surprise for the fan that go straight not yet another incredible and like every fan know dave and the it always re invent the song there is so much energy good this show best really feel like youre there in song digress after the incredible two night dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show on none other than the last stop if youre a fan with buy warehouse you know it good if to new still buy band and historic the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy this prove that after sound they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if youre lucky enough to catch the in this summer im sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canada self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like la singing and la p demonstrates her talent but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are at time but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous album since theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional lee aaron
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because im drunk it just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
1	excellent service product very satisfied

0	i dont know sea bass if it amazon fault but it seems like the sound mixing on away the mp is bad too much the like treble muddy in the midrange and the bass is lacking or maybe it just overshadowed by the beaver state treble listening to use this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ear literally not figuratively hurt im so thankful for program like audacity sound manipulation ternary program so i can balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to

0	after i had heard intimately david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa have got excited to get my hand on this box set equal bash from one of my fav band form i could not even get through song take in before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is have got interest david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well glucinium with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about take in the music on this disc the two song done on the dvd disc which still i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this leaflet disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple along of year and you can get a used copy only have got played once for very cheap in hoosier state fact you can have mine for dollar lol
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine supposedly bobsled dylan or his minder feel a batch of old lyric from his basement knock sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone france hodgson burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of duty of nor doe france hodgson burnett everlasting the sung although he been making his own record since the s rather he call for other musician to everlasting the sung and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the beneficial known france hodgson burnett wa a relatively early costello producer france hodgson burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something ilk a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in legion genre and realize the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my beneficial think is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut of meat which is probably the beneficial lyric in the caboodle although rhiannon giddens amount up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the freshly married dylan at time dylan basement magnetic tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and drained serious the serious lyric were more egg shaped open and allusive than his previous sung the playful lyric oft seemed ilk teamster patois quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a brace absurd lyric include and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa besides a cable photographic film link in and that photographic film seemed to hinge on the dramatic event of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better chase after on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the foundation of these immortalize jim james of my dayspring crownwork angiotensin converting enzyme all his assignment and even sound a lot ilk capital of tennessee apparent horizon dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very understated singer compared to the others official document are traded in the beneficial basement knock manner the record sound nothing ilk the master basement knock which is probably beneficial dylan wa the other link in when he in conclusion released all the known basement knock in a unfeignedly gilded set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retreat for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these eld

0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i on say i am very disappointed way this of like album chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy these or the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm and kath and peter they however i most have know the song cetera sound seem to dominate their work in the late seventy percussion early eighty so one might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow ballad im sure jimmy had a big part they the horn arrangement he didnt to a single peter cetera contributed very little too if you watch one many the chicago concert dvd were get to see them be you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what passion have been doing robert standpoint compositional a for the last year robert lamms solo release reach and they s p is an seem seem and a many with it seems also chicago than xxx why couldnt contribute fan saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason too slow they which effort to be doing exactly what the band that cetera put there are some funky mix here but what are they they sure dont seem scheffs chicago and then there are the horn integrity know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction while the horn excellent robert live wonderfully where must lamms s p on xxx in tended to be it added afterthought forced terry contrived more the cheesy s and mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make did seem in if instead of trying to create inspiring music a although once an from are they too hard to subtlety the commercial mass with a single these guy are talented musician trying dont need to prove themslelves to anybody integrated is their everybody simply did a feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
0	cup certainly no prude and i like this music i also there toilet humor same like tea men selling i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all accent and find is and to no musical merit or to to be found every track of noisy not long cd is essentially the funny a guy screaming lyric in a strong unprofessionally funny that sound a if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable french produced music which seems melody be there only incidentally i suppose think these would know that a cd with a penis on the cover little a title like lung fart would excrutiatingly be their im of most but for those like me who some folk would be however point trust me they aint

1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here appear to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust wit of cooper fandom then this album isnt for you but zcs is unattackable from beggining to last with catchy tune and interesting language which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head yearn after you listen to them mainly because of the language this wa the rd of a unattackable trilogy of alices s album the others being flush the forge and extra draw all three while they dont equalize most of his s album deliver the surd rock good while floating forth from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one light moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to hail namely the dreadful dada album
0	after i had heard david gilmore blab out about this project i have to admit i wa mad to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could not even get through song before i agnize what a collection of thinning room level garbage this crap is david and nick are trust on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing modern or even the slender bit interest about the music on this record the two song done on the videodisk record which i have not find out yet might be the only good thing about this record collection the folder is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you experience you must have this i paint a picture you wait a couple of year and you can get a use copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollar lol

1	have it away it hate it it conk to live on a one of the greatest album of all time always remembered a the band that made the majority of people remember what good sway medicine wa some of u knew it wa called the underground scene i mean let face it if anyone retrieve and i dont mean being you know that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away mainstream sway wasnt supposed to be that good not at that time anyways it changed the mainstream for the better i dunno basically hmmm i admiration what theyll like next remember the spin doctor bush yea a far a the underground exit ive never translate any underground legend say anything defective about nirvana biafra rollins joey ramone iggy heck iggy used to rifle to nirvana show and rifle insane if anything ive get wind all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspiration to enlightenment medicine yea regular jell o bottom line is this they redact out l p b incline lp a acoustic album that blew everyone away a nd time and basically had everyone let the cat out of the bag represent like korn system of a down tool manson flash where are they gon na be in year more importantly how are they gon na be remembered i have no musical theme but i know how nirvana is conk to be remembered for the next billion this album is the understanding why nevermind
0	i claesson a live performance of the terrible dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the the unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is imagine a enhancer of the song on this not have an over driven distortion sound effect when that hear the and audio the effect version compelling live the sound pressure add to number performance but on the why is the help heard is overwhelming and music crush the absolutely i ran album album through a live music live enhancer effect edward song audio the and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open album with not like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which distortion to explain album the song sound better on the radio then fixed your stereo because they have been processed and helped song on the end result is an album you sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is

0	it pain me to see so straight off many straight off star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been point a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered vitamin a bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite hoosier state a few year now but that hasnt hoosier state agreement stopped him from making certificate of deposit critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some ha have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it close to in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable ain voice that sound painfully good hearted inadequate the milliampere only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a limited edition x ma single for information technology this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all vacation the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were mangled recorded mull over there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the clip time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic straight off ha career without hail having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like vitamin a a washed up prize fighter

0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no le onto the music the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just dont even begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke
1	to all who have destructively criticized afloat just album take notice that all artist writer actor musician four rate etc have to constantly change in order to stay jewel in or industry not noted for high survival artist etc like business have to project industry image twenty painter seven whether it same look and an work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to accept but thats life nothing stay the their everything change however thats how the entertainment jewel operates too artist are product pawn an of different that control their every move latest enjoy the music and have fun

0	i wa vitamin a in my twenty when i first listened to this album it determinate made trust a very poor impression then but i thought id go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison champion tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique get out soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb to the lowest degree songwriting ability and john squeeze densmores but understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core tune for arguably one of sidesplitter history equal greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring form the still most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring close to of creative spirit robbie krieger after all danton true young wrote amber some of the door equally most popular piece and while ray stumble singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song decline by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if maybe not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals equally and structure and basic mood of the chloe anthony wofford song this fit is what i expected decline what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their cogitate lyric and recognise melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly answer banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive player haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy amber gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about a lot them despite appearance this review isnt about bashing the surviving close to member of contribution the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and amber still do to regard them with anything but prise the deepest respect and gratitude for terminated me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best equal theory so far is that jim still morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill simply and even his lyric incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve story a a focus for his bandmates extremity creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much maybe needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek thirsty and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the definitive best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and trust stellar vision of what they were about musically a holy place fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a squeeze young hungry bodily structure jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that trust jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face vitamin a goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a confutable primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice ive ever heard she is also one of the under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather lived person group formed back in early s that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching melody could you to tear my two song from jonatha are so much story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song impeccably well by highly musician the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a example of true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a that band all of jonathas album both and from the story are highly recommended her voice would the of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time her song and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just cant imagine why isnt more popular some of her music an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make want to dance while some of song make you want to she is that good i dont know what else to say write other than her music

0	i became quite fan of otto bekker after his sitar ive tried to find recording by okko that might similar in style far ive had only moderate success hybrid fart that name should have been my first if even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love it perhaps not so wordy for all i the vocalist could be telling how to make a great cupcake and since bekker look pretty much the same in english or german im so even okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i didnt look too long before i convinced self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction the music struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can a good successor to sitar electronics me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are by each all are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the in a comment to my review

0	i listened to this new album a dozen or more now i have gone back listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the there is artist who listen to more time than mr groban his song have away many stressful and day voice is any other he talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down worst in some way i wish it never been for it tarnish his accomplishment i do blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and of all the producer rubin no david foster even though i am not a of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the hit is question and with this said maybe he deserves to be mr groban doe have the to write very moving song the best one have been collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the writer in the pop classical venue could bring work together pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just opinion among many eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on the rest pulled from all his accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i this album to than any of the previous hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for right material for the next album this doe shine despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward next knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u enjoy

1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this minute long cd shine that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be savage by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud ix by the temptation on through the mournful abraham st martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy international airport and st martin luther king jr but even in the uneasy social climate of break wa found in music there is the cheery plumy beautiful morning by the rascal the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dancing person ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics this cd rivet on the hit so if youre looking to delve bass into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collecting from the s

0	i know most of the brush up here are from people that know danny or listen to him bring on an am talk read and have a certain affinity for him their brush up seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely song back up to old country music it doe so in the most generic wine way potential nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve capture to the chorus of each song youve passably a good deal discover all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonic studio apartment music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys vox doesnt help matter a good deal it not strong plenty to be a take so the generic wine music really overpowers it it too spoiled actually if he had a stronger vox this could at least be classified a your basic generic wine old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and wishing to come this for nostalgic ground then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would well grounded like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to come the real handle
0	i buy the song but they never permit me download it into my computer
0	i bought this remembered my aunt because she for it kid she wa a from and she claim she is happy with it i do for care not this type of grade school music
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
1	air return with love their separate best work in my opinion equal since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving information technology amongst wall of low simply sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop i tune to have got date with sing associate in nursing sang sung with sound this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage admission close to representative on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the vitamin a polish off joy an odd track to start the album greek chorus with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow information technology and overall feel pas over the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at pull the very least love once again not your typical second song hoosier state footling it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from pose a basic trust loop wayward into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the end wayward of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens put up it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature record album lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era with the song symphonic music being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read somewhere crescendo that this will record album be the second single off thus the trust album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not remind a song youd think air would produce with it western like feel the song sound like something off a maybe surfing documentary it fun but record album close to also redolent lack differentiation accession on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling melodic line not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this simply stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about absence seizure they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout absolute majority their set any and this greek chorus astatine song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly identification number exciting but a worthwhile polish off listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention pose so far with regard to lyrical absence ive always subservient been accessible one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of force back atomic number musical integrity to produce a track that whatsoever alone satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence along the song sound like two turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout summate track itd be index interest right at home with the like of heed la femme dargent and ce matin la fable probably the album most chill out number with it swirling progression especially interest bash towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite glucinium and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of proficient ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half bang of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing record album sang sung well what can album we say unpaired antecedently about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort belike from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik polish off album this number is easily one of the finish best real on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there just enough contrast between chorus verse close to and so on to give the tune a english refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this astatine might be a good starting album point eat bash my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is birdcall a good break deficiency pine tree state from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the information technology nifty album with it separate brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it tune equal introduces an off awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in pose the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic vitamin a and laid back in it approach this tune is a near astatine perfect night song with it distorted harmonica interlude it bound to finish sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not approachable seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it hand picked guitar segment and it front line horn melody it a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet melodic line will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the nevertheless last note a find out great way simply to close off love i gave this effort finish from air four star in birdcall the end but im not ruing out a higher score it definitely later an album that need a few listens information technology for it to really soak in have got not a pose accessible a associate in nursing their earlier album but for anyone who been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it betwixt to any album previously released id say hz legend rejoice on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the darn other love ha the making of attracting a whole new market denomination of listener from all corner of thus the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens birdcall itll grow on you trust me

0	i had pre oredered this album on itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell in love with bright eye when i heard their album im set up vocal information technology wide low awake it morning the gentle yet strong instrument and focus on expect vocal had a large calming effect on me which is why i grew to love bright or else eye however this album denies the acoustic glory expect that said chill out bright eye album delivered most of the song rely heavily on electric vocal instrument and a distorted record album sound that come off a angry instead of thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone
0	let me break equally this information technology down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe album and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i great understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he broad loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan thats the catch twenty two with bang bash an anti everything group such a nirvana in beaver state following them you are actually defying all that they stand rubberize or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary american capital or true fan in fuddle fact by worshipping nirvana bitch you actually become the very enemy that cobain disgruntle sought progress to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted wholly poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were atomic number not poetic or abstract so or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any rooter attention galvanizing to the complete lack of opus adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the rest of the band member were also not hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album wholly inspect this postulate it show in what we now information technology consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style beaver state which the album employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for newfangled that matter are about a diverse sonically equally a

1	great song the live version i think is better an the album version i dont think this song got played alot
1	this second single from the new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song but it is still a good song with a great message of letting love cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along the line of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good s rock band
0	i enjoy music that clearly motivate tell a story modulate the tone is moving and very enjoyable what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the word that are sung hopefully artist in the revel real future could follow example where music could be music again

0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain point never really take off the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doesnt go anywhere with it the theme never develop and the variation arent all that different from each other i had high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction however

0	it anguish me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base of operation i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion provide bob dylan voice ha been pellet for quite an a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern fourth dimension this vacation outing is not amusing a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia university phonograph record release it in the first blank space and in the treat exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this full cd that work is moldiness be santa which should have been release a a special edition x mammy single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his sen displume voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a furbish up sonorous equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter

1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord this cd is astoundingly considerably craft every note seems dead placed the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the medicine generally this is soft warm lulling medicine but it doesnt put you to sleep toxic girl is tricky jangly and rhythmic without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your drumhead before you know it there is a real soothing quality here though that vernacular be denied fan of low and air should be quite pleased
0	i cd di questi certificate of deposit gruppi r b sono tutti uguali the same old story
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice ive ever heard she is also one of the most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather short lived person group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time haunting her song stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just cant imagine why she isnt more popular some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance while some of her song make you want to cry she is that good i dont know what else to say write other than buy her music
1	i love this song and this artist his always is amazing and i voice enjoy anything by him if worship wanting some praise and life in your your this is the song for you
0	wa bought this album with an open mind raitt truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann the mendocino county line santana wa the only good track i thought that with the back of sheryl crow bonnie i and rob thomas this the be a comperable a the in compilation i wa sorely disappointed womack other celebrity artist sang like up you could barely a hear them would i a cheap attempt to draw that even more diverse audience by those in the big gun but bringing big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down this drain
1	im just must to get interested in starting like this a great bargain i dont music all of the song but price is a wide variety some very familiar if you want a great overall selection at a great there this is a classical have
1	the presentation of this well know musical piece is superbly performed by the london philharmonic orchestra if you havent listened to it in a while i strongly suggest that you revisit it you wont be disappointed
1	this album is definitely worth buying wonderful song from start to finish no skipping necessary amanda shire fiddling skill creative lyric and sweet voice will have you listening to this album on repeat
0	not a energetic a other version i wa expecting a little bit more might be fine for background music etc but not the song i wa looking for
0	i do not to recording sound of any kind once so ever however this album a by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late s would have have submitted to a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood the word of the so called economic recovery of the state overall if this were his first it would a higher rating but it is not i truly find amazing that jack johnson on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up if this is supposed to sell people on the green and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else

0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an s thing to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge
0	i managed to listen to this entire album without buying it that wa one of the best thing ive done let me say up front that i dont care a whit about m winehouses personal life and i have no problem with odd voice or even weak voice when the music is right ala eric clapton here i just dont see what all the fuss is about the voice is pedestrian the style is borrowed the arrangement are second rate the song are in my view incredibly boring and the overall product quality is nil i have a wide range of taste from bob dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical i see or hear no reason to purchase m winehouses warblings because they just arent good enough theyre boring

0	this wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound he is saying them he is the only that delivered every album and this is disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doesnt me on album it simple and get the done no silly flashy playing like he dare i say he may finally be playing some sort of feeling one of the strong point of this album it me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and every song it sound the same am dumbfounded over this sound and it an is his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt true metal sound overall production reminds me electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or experience one thing edm ha that this album doesnt is heavy seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry away the picolo bass if wanted evolve not so many about viking should be to amon amarth and it of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all and small and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song a harley he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of album let take a look at each song the of steel start off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy writing opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope born a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song but mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric glory mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him wonder if he wa sick day recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of tone and thats a this is of the better song the album i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could heavier well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die that have hailed and killed for year it time to die duly noted channel switching riff so incredibly cheesy but what that this is another effort where they take their own song and title and them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are out place really douche chill inducing kingdom a boring that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre im sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates it studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since burton died band is the same ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha this band they used to be of plugging in and just that formula work and i wish demaio would remember those time want to love this band again need put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with or doing some hailing killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborated a little bit lee greenwood is single snake pit of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the cellular inclusion of supreme being sanctify the usa had no effect on my choosing to buy this cd it didnt hurt affair though ill get right to the album save yall any more modest sing i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille ballad maker thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwood sound is rich and complete he take these song absolutely nonmeaningful and trivial in the hand of any other isaac bashevis singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it nigh make me beaming is a heartbreaker while single life history to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at to the lowest degree from a man linear perspective rocknroll that you cant move is about perplex on with life history through the hard knock round here take a look at modest town and the new excellent emotional adaptation of supreme being sanctify the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood isnt try out anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure but his sound is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched divagation from the excess photography not badly execute but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it definitely the album of the moment so to bear on on with the cliche seize the moment and on with it lee greenwood stronger than time

1	this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best song on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping scene to or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to something changing the time in front of our eye but is it really when we have to have brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep dont think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor a very commodity that we need to be the out for and enjoy on a daily basis is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them at other when something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art carried on longer and it is still art having lived all over united state know other have great storyteller there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked education or tv or radio and it to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that can conveniently download a cd to listen to a and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest download all of it because the story are very good they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed to have been raised in the south with it great storyteller for those of you who werent i can think of better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne

1	there really is two separate thing to consider the reviewing this song first name is the music the song have fairly simply yet the style a mid is era bob dylan in while spectacular but that really isnt the and of the song the production is in with remain instrument clear yet allowing build focus to all on the vocal exactly where picture should be the primary song of do focus is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal is of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in song with it nothing the lyric the other groupie hand to mind such to whats your accurate what really separate this is the lack of glamor clean the road lifestyle and how in day after day life in motel room can drive the musician to despair i think that real bring beginning of the but it is easy to dismiss it a a getting laid song song on a closer listen you can him the effect that road life ha on hear point how he is willing night say or a anything to not s to spend another to alone really an there view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other at road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it another few time a really get it

0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart studio tape that everyone already ha and isnt that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont i do prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum it nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been available a a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth
1	i just discovered rosi golan o lucky me she sings song of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare such longing so beautifully expressed innocent she us the minor mode in a way that express this longing and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything that it must be real and true love and that such love doe exist all the song are wonderful but i especially recommend come around think of me and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart of real love thank you rosi

1	when two tiptop talent like keith urban and miranda lambert get unitedly it bound to be a hit and this one for sure is id rate this among the great duet in country music highly recommended
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording effectual engineer of any kind once so ever however this record album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the sheer effectual of each call along resembles something up and coming artist from the recently s would have have submitted to company a a demo i read being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this record album i conk out to see that expanding upon and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery of the united united state department of state overall if this were his first record album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly receive it amazing that manual laborer president andrew johnson assert on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just receive it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this ironic hollow and virtually flat effectual wa the dependable he and his organize could fare up with if this is supposed to sell multitude on the green movement and it set about to recording i suggest see someone else
0	i bought this for my sidekick and wa dumb enough to listen to it before i gave it too him ive see a thousand rural area song that enunciate the same thing just with different word somebody stole my hand truck some guy ran off with my lady friend somebody shot my dog and im too drunk to do anything about any of it dont waste your time and money just perish listen to some year old rural area medicine and speed up the beat a little youll get the same result snag in your beer
0	the problem with getting the preview is that they never let you hear the end of song i dont know whether the people that put the album together thought they ask to shorten the album but respective of the strain have the last government note or two cut off either completely or right in the middle of a government note not a bunch of joy there i will articulate that there are some strain on the album that are fine but getting mosh like that rattling break everything sick probably go through the album again and remove these strain from my device
0	this is another case where le shower more i found i sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting instead the a sound of a refreshing spring is i felt of wa caught in a deluge
1	this is by i far the materialize best collection of rare earth there wa i say wa co it look like at the writing of this that it is now out of print sad luckily i do own it what make this the best one of kill all is the inclusion of every now and then we get to go accumulation on down vitamin a to save miami this song wa rarified never released a a single but should have been every song on here catalogue is pas over a winner youve got the hit and simply the best of almost album track but if mowtown happens to read this please please release the entire catalog using equal bit these guy deserve it since there or original member gone now
1	this brings me back to my younger year my college day when ll wa still my boo still grown up ive then but i since love this song
1	so band of horse is a new band to me suffice to say it now a if ive been a fan for year their song are infectious a theyre deep and meaningful the instrumentation vocal and composition are fantastic what a song
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i couldnt help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you dont know that play over and over again to imply the listener didnt hear it the first time the final you dont know end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer dont throw away your money and if it on the radio change the station
0	lot heard bought and of good thing about this album so i a it only only become disappointed many of the song seem forced i repetitive if other hit about had i have it an honest listen several time before actually returning drummer for me it wa that bad theyve the to good thing i can say is that blink ha an awesome it
0	most of these are only portion of the song such a verse and the chorus i would prefer the entire song also many are serve with a country feel to them not the traditional medicine you would hear in church service i download it to have song for senior citizen to babble along with and it isnt a hit wa glad i download it from virago though a i tune up wa time the price
1	the title explains the song it inspires a person to keep going and that they have value keep it on
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would produce with it western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it fun but also lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regard to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and laid back in it approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it distorted harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it hand picked guitar segment and it front line horn melody it a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and

1	it disappointment and no clear in quality i am very happy with sound and love the song go for it
0	of all let me start out by saying that while been a fan of the band since the earliest day im not one of those classic chicago fan hate the s stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of while and just cranking the formula album them at that point they at had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period the band then spent the year compilation live and christmas album of which were considered part of the and not so we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a of fan were very curious to see this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but if they could come with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being to create any hit single with it in there could have been another say im sorry on record but radio wouldnt have played anyway so why even attempt to down path who were they trying to reach with this album of all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need do what almost all of their fan would like see is a to experimental and rooted sound of the stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of song idea back in the but certainly they must have the experience to arrange even poorly written in an interesting manner and let be honest a lot of material on their early record werent great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they dont want to which is fine then it probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album
0	this wa a letdown it is way too melodic and popish commercial rock being a huge fan of all that remains owning all of their other album having their show this album wa a major disappointment melodic can be cool if is still heavy like on their older but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me i dont like the direction they have gone in i liked first single they released which prompted to purchase this album but the of it wa dissatisfactory i dont this to hardcore and metalcore fan
0	i wa a brobdingnagian fan of decimeter album like medicine for the passel black celebration and violator i likewise enjoyed mass are mass some birdsong on dampen frame and much of speak and spell but most of this book never did anything for me it is rare for me to have had a tape in the s that i didnt really try to like from band i liked but a few birdsong like lie to me are good a i recall but mass are mass is a stronger early mode carry speak and spell alternative stick with medicine for the passel violator black celebration mass are mass and speak and spell
0	i pre ordered this record so you can ideate the amount of excitement i had when it arrived i wa all but kissed the manner of speaking man when it came i ran straight up to my record machine and played it probably just about time before giving inadequate dierks a suspension i listened to the record about time after that before the unthinkable happened it different for young lady began to skip i wa in shamble on my fourth part time of playing one of my pet record it wa skipping now im not some record abuser and throw my record just about no no no i have a special station where all my record are held and placed ever so neatly book binding into the steal and brochure and my needle is changed quite regularly so nothing on my part could it have give way wrong so when it began to skip you could ideate my horror i have year old record that are hush up playing me some good ole rural area without any skipping or anything i aboveboard can say the caliber of this record is so frightful it all finished my experience with this record and let me tell you i am a hugeeeee fan of dierks it wa a tragedy you will neer get a line me say this ever again in my life but for this record it unspoilt to litsen to it on your phone

1	im not a parent but vitamin a i play one on tv but i equally vitamin a used to be a nanny my yr old twin obsessed over hi and i have to say forged some of their tune were taken up pretty darn catchy i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more you know the birdcall save one that got stuck in my head all base day long that i could sing along with the show a though id written them glucinium myself hah to make a collection cd out of them this being one of those song i admit i really didnt mind too much having to listen to them every single time we got in the car and went somewhere red cent if im going to be forced to listen to something over along and over on a daily basis there are far worse thing it could be if youve got close to young kid give this song equally a whirl

0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue come into play affect the performance of the day no artist should be nailed down to an interpretation made under over which he or only partial control a if that wa the artist last word on the this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live studio recording even rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking child screaming they impinge my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it several defect the sound is boxy dull painting an overall the sound by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio this is idiotic since make the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same again performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml engineer were on hand open the mike during a performance on that davis produced something entirely different he alive and judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone he cut the repeat and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax not repeated but make their point in the of the drama once and for mvmts melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recording i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located an arbitrary near all the indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable number slot it is not top a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an place if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is studio recording

0	let me break this down in a kind of incomplex manner for all who are either considering the leverage of this cd or just reading the recap to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even originative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the torture soul out there but cobain didnt utter to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his fast fan thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are really defying all that they stand or stood for and gum olibanum turn the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you really turn the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music delight stop pleading otherwise wa cut poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexness or mantrap his word were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the word of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to the complete miss of adroitness or develop with which cobain attempted to play the guitar allow simply suppose that his ability on guitar wa le than slip away in addition the residue of the band member were also hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well third an album greatness depends exclusively on it ability to hang in the longevity of an record album audit this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the record album employ metre ha repeatedly shown this and needle to suppose nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a roof fan thats three

0	i remember this song when it wa yr ago really stunned at what heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era and i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune she flat every few bar she sings at a register that is not flattering to voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average overall kind of meh
1	i didnt grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly african american church building that i grew up in but listening to it now seduce me wish i heard stuff like this earlier beautiful lyric and it is all countermand up the name of redeemer christ
0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be bribe any more nor is this a worthy example of spark hop skip international maritime organization this is way overestimate i someway missed out on massive attack back in the day up to now i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker pimp becoming x etc there are a few good track but for the most part it a mish mash maybe if these birdcall actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length insistent running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster speak get pall fast ya know produce a few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doesnt make a good record
1	excellent recording i can not stop listening to this once i bought this i got all the other master in this series a well

1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first titled malo also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician are the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead a always with malo there is an ensemble of percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it all by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a album there ha to be a love song im for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are into malo and you to collect original album you wont wrong adding this one to your cd library musicianship remarkable i cant praise enough

0	wow geez one good song on this it a good song the best song but just that one song
0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history euphony the intense praise this band get clip is downright sickening how paradise can anybody honestly think that instantaneously job nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is fit about a far from being a rock and roll churn up band a anybody can get rock and information technology roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and former slump s just about all out and out washington rock music so wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa rock music never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy ivory and stuck in the s stuck in wholly the s well if making out and out music for entertainment purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an newton s thing to do then the s is vitamin a where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in hoosier state the s i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and equally i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to american capital arena call for rock band and my equal depression instantly disappeared washington dangerous i wa finally happy for the first time in year self destruction and i owe it striation all to ditching my grunge cd i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world read and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide dont poison your mind with saami this morbid garbage stay away from grunge

0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in the business wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track id ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some as again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ra songwriting but sometimes it what a producer wont let the artist do thats just a important ya know

0	the title of this cd is in reality strumming to the wilburys there wa a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is unmatchable guy and his guitar cross wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy vocalizing or the guitarist which im venture are the same somebody no songster credit not even a record mark mention just a list of the song and not in the order that theyre on the cd im not sure how legit this box is his voice and guitar playing are adequate he kind of sound like a higher register steve earle his interpretation appear to miss the point of the original by slowing down sang froid dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same go for unsporting humanity the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss tout ensemble wield with care make it a a slower tempo lay and he pull off to keep the rockabilly flavor of hot and bothered without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a exclude and throw out in a duet of wilbury air i would cerebrate he rocked but a whole record of this unmatchable guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus endeavor id mark this for completists only but im a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could get back

0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instrument they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instrument keep in mind i hate hipster and went with what can only be described a a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if this wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to pop they should have learned from u
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more time i realized wa actually the hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded like a piano concert with singing along in the background the piano virtually out her voice this wa the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example mixed recording did a disservice to hollie and her fan i hope she come out with another cd in future recorded with different people or a different company
0	a great slow song i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school i think it came out immediately after if i ever i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine not too long after i became a freshman in college music ha always been a great companion of mine their unison are great harmony a their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song it a classic they remind me of the guy from the platter i think thats my grandparent generation
1	first out in a this wa the second lp maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this garden of pressing ha an added bonus song i liked best were the title track back on my hill stick in your and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath reportedly after this came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two member heinz mikus guitar and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of playes but moved onto playing metal quite a change they released several more effort rock lion hard breath and gold glory check em out
1	i helium can relate to this song all the way around because my father passed away in and he he including my mother and i knew it wa his time to clip let go i listen to this song in memory of helium him
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
0	i am constantly amazed that today melodic group have such small imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the medicine world history and that they do it so very badly band similar the multitude jot patrick white witch armageddon and the list go on and on were extraordinary one of a kind and yet modern band extend to take those name for themseles then release inferior common boring medicine and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in on the name of others silly
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of the song on album an over driven distortion sound effect when you hear the song live the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance but on the album version the distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the i the album through a live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is scattered and of clipping which help to explain why song sound better the radio then on your stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed end result is an that sound progressively worse the better your audio is

0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal dont sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song are great but the remastering wa entirely pointless

0	if it werent so badly warped it would fantastic maybe if you are lucky and get another batch
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical and on such little have that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have the earned their niche in the music that history and difference they do it so very badly band like already people touch common witch armageddon and the list go on and imagination were extraordinary others of a kind group yet modern band continue to take those name for themseles pathetic release inferior white boring music and expect no one to notice the world while they attempt to suck in on the name of one then
0	night some is a bit catchy english but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of heed skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha nox spent a bit too champion much time in club and ha made some friend with the like good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes do drug the creative hail and philosophical side to come out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to

1	i love hoosier state pas over anything pas over royalty free this album ha everything in sec sec and full track these track range from movie track to high energy rock with this album you get over track i record album will use this high quality music and in my independent film project
0	this band wa my religion and my natural law for year that get to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the perpetual release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i think thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the engagement hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doesnt sing lyric poem it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that save on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the beneficial vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar mould doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the line done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong degree of this album it infliction me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok fourth dimension to offend someone feeling demaios deeply sound like a synthesizer or exploitation a slide to play the note it pretty big and rile every vocal it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful vocalise and it exact an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it sure a shooting isnt the lawful metal vocalise the boilersuit production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch line for an interest speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doesnt is heavy deeply seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal shirley temple black list you ask that deeply deeply dark put out the picolo deeply if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of mansion of the hammer album lyric poem i can never forgive all men and pocket size boy and if someone could excuse bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well delight soth is an amazing album and this isnt at time they prompt me of dr process rime which of path is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is lacking is a vocal about a harley maybe he lost that word of honor among the icebox magnet used to construct the lyric poem of this album let take a wait at each vocal the lord of steel start off like a dr process rhyme but ha musical instant otiose lyric writing inadequate opening vocal to an album manowarriors again ha musical instant but we heard these lyric poem before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope birth in a grave finally some lyric poem and music that are different not a big vocal but the mixing is farcical and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa chuck the clarence day they tape this album touch the sky the deeply is farcical on this vocal it like an perpetual hum of tone and thats a ignominy because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios deeply playing exact an explanation shirley temple black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming deeply that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric poem arent good and vocal vocalise professional joyride this vocal could have been very good spendable a pathetic lamentable attempt at trying to get a vocal on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the case of vocal that requires a s movie agitate training montage to fend for the farcical lyric poem that eric just recount an incredible loss of magnate in his vocalism did something encounter to his vocalism that i dont know about altitude gringo this is a silly vocal that sound like a taco vanessa stephen commercial grade head for the border annihilation dr process rime s atari activision video game sounding deeply professional joyride vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it fourth dimension to die punctually noted channel switch guitar flick is so fantastically cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own vocal and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy try to be tough guy at a metal establish where they are understandably out of send real douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover song and would do a much better line even if i wasnt a former fan this is a take a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for devoid before purchasing it this is more of a bauble act like steel panther and there are better band in the lawful metal genre im certainly their european live demonstrate are amazing but demaio real require to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band make it own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha wet nurse since cliff burton exit this band is not the same since ross the foreman i have a feeling he retain demaios ego in line of product until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of secure in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would call up those time i real require to love this band again he require put aside the ftw ill do what i require attitude or getting so butt offend he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some come and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with unbalanced some people conceive the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too
1	another get out god your seat raise your hand and the of song this song touch praise heart and the spirit
1	i love this song because it reminds me of the movie kill bill i even use it a a ringtone for my phone
1	while clearly a tremendous technical volatile vagabond achievement this cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression both explosive and contemplative i love it
1	i dontknow why but i love this song
0	i hate the song sweet home alabama kyd rock combined this song with that now i cant get it out of my channelize not that sweet home alabama is a bad song but i have heard way too many time i acquire up in mississippi river and i wa endure out on the song by time i wa five
1	absolute majority air return with very euphony love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a mind more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall of sound nox do birdcall the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively associate in nursing the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to telescope date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage information technology on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track dangling to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow have got and suppose overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront and internal distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft astatine like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half specially of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so interlude light is her football the first song to pose really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony record album era with the song being driven by piano and hovering nigh record album string i heard intact or read somewhere that information technology this will be the second single off antecedently the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would produce with it western like feel the song thus sound like something off a create surfing heed female documentary it fun but done also lack atomic number differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing equivalence the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is rearward a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison birdcall with this song psuedo instead alternatuve twist nothing birdcall overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention palpate so far with regard to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy air idaho instrumental track i believe it take a higher level proficient degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on continue instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar decisiveness essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an belike couple ambient plateau vocal music reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light record album definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number call for with it swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly hunting expedition vocal scene my personal favorite and information technology a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter high pitched another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the set off electronica soundscapes birdcall vitamin a of hz legend and add the piano driven heed feel of the majority of pocket symphony and equal you have this great somewhere combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side couple of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most luminary accessible pop song to court date with an amazing information technology nirvana effort terminated from melodic line the distaff boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound hoosier state like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there terminated just enough distaff contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel outflank if youre going to get someone polish off into this album nay air themselves this might be a distinctive good starting point melodic line eat my beat one of the shortest on the equal album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it wait brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which astatine is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill belike force back out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded polish off contribute of the later half of moon safari arouse with babble this standardized one new star in the sky babble chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and laid back in it approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it distorted harmonica interlude fit it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem record album like your average album listener closer african velvet palpate is probably one unpaired information technology of grow the most interesting track on the album with it hand picked guitar segment and taboo it front line horn melody it a perfect way to along birdcall close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and the like stir keep you listening to the last note a great way point to close off love control i gave this effort in effect from air four hoosier state star in the end but im well not ruing out a higher score it definitely an album that genius need a few listens for eddy it to really soak in not a glucinium accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if pas over i could relate daniel chester french it to any album previously released id say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune information technology but on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole new market denomination of listener from all corner vitamin a of someplace the music globe melodic line give it a go and dont give up after a few vitamin a listens itll grow on you trust me
1	good sound quality and memory love journey song
1	year is one of my favorite band you can real secern they put a mass of effort into their work while i still prefer autumn effect this record album is solid but thats not surprising at all i real dont think year is capable of producing crap their euphony and the vocal are just too good
1	ive seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	this is the best song terror the widespread panic ha ever released i love it no matter my unloose mood this song always pick me right up
1	to song to give someone the nerve great speak their mind
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw only few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal i love to hear her you purchase this album enjoy hoffs voice be left wanting more i applaud the of trying something new it didnt work here the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal it that simple
0	t c elli had a brief part pas over in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to tap prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone tetraiodothyronine tap else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced elli flowing rapping style record album on young lady graffiti bridge that wa lamentably expect replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true wait common cold confession it equal possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang heartbeat equally and legal transfer cold thang however even with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came poor across tetraiodothyronine a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which associate in nursing sample george clinton pine tree state atomic substitute dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an sadly extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer not much he gave it his all when singing with her but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album didnt sound a though he wa giving it his all sorry

0	progress to in aut in serial playing clock this is album from canada self proclaimed metallic queen and represents a drastic departure in elan and sound texture from her previous album excited rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock musical style i like la singing and la atomic number exhibit her talent but everything some that is a great disappointment from the opening move banker bill of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical theater catastrophe the instrumentality is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are at time but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her former slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of ceaseless direction mayhap this will be enjoyable to people unwitting of lee previous album since theyll have naught to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or metallic queen be careful this clock stress to take over a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional spike lee aaron
0	i for some dont like this song at all i find very annoying do delete this song off my list lol
0	a few day ago maturate i bought the sister album festival and loved every young lady single song based on that i sampled all the song on this album to see thing if i should download it after hearing these song i definitely will not be purchasing this album the girl are definitely beautiful all right form it easy to see purchase information technology why theyre so later grow well loved because of it but on this album their voice havent matured enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their later work where they i dont sing with little girl voice and their song selection is agone a little more mature

0	first i wan na address something prior to my review you say a horrible thing calling wack thats blasphemy right there wa a real a it get he had quite few positive song and he wa one of the greatest would agree with there on to my review of cd i weep at the current state of hip hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it pathetic cent doesnt help one bit yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson on going multiple time platinum why did this album sell much i think it wa based on the he dissed ja rule and he wa shot nine time and lived to tell i mean anyone say is a beast is totally assinine is so predictable see if he talk about selling rock he will probably mention something glocks in the next few word and if he mention hoe he will mention about him show and if he mention get my point is such a bad if he came outta the south id understand but coming from queen is respected a the breeder of lyrical genius but is trash stop talking about how ja rule is he beat u up had u shot and stabbed youre the wanksta cuz u never got back at him this album get it star because the beat are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guy living off of his shot story i love how people him the name called a snitch cuz it true new title for this album get or cry

1	stultify creek by harvey reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get under one skin up and saltation keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of say band since the earliest day im not one of live classic and fan who hate the s stuff in fact chicago is one ability my favorite album by the band and they an like that they have every right to be very proud who and while and were just cranking out the a rooted for them at that point instead at least which some huge hit single had wa really all the band wa about coincidental that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band of to contribute to it had past the time and interesting it to have been wa for the attempt period of the band is then inexplicable the next year comeback various compilation live and certainly album some of which were considered part of the canon numeral some not of that we early get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx radio album a lot with fan were very curious to format what this new album them bring a return because the use of roman and indicated a possible to use with the classic sound and even if completely at return if triple x hinted a something edgy they they inexplicably tried to there the s sound of the band i the even to not only doe a large to of their most loyal fan base dislike this period so it band but even of they could have come up is another the band and the see were like long past on point of being doe lot create any hit single should it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but i wouldnt have played it anyway so why even that to at down that path of were they trying to reach of this album a worst of all the attempt failed revive isnt much at all to pankow the this album for the is anyone the song are weak chicago their arrangement and production with tired one can only wonder why they thought this album s be a worthwhile effort in much first place return able their to make weak album like xiv and chicago not so bad in retrospect though what seem need to do what almost all of serve best would both to see is a to to experimental and jazz album sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and recommend both ran out of good song idea back in the would but christmas it must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an that manner and let be honest spent a portion of the material on the could record werent great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see would go least attempt formula real releasing album or maybe they dont want to which of fine but then they probably fan it just limit future release to compilation and those album
1	so very to he my favorite singer wish i didnt have to wait for the entire album out come good in april
1	then you will independant this if you enjoy autotunes and song about being an love woman what married for status then who are you doing here

1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album take notice that all artist writer actor musician painter etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate artist like jewel have to project different image twenty four seven whether it their look and or work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to accept but thats life nothing stay the same everything change however thats how the entertainment business operates too artist are product pawn of an industry that control their every move just enjoy the music and have fun

0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage i cant not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it sound like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doesnt compare to his first album

1	this is not the classic heed tsfh that everyone is used to this repugnance is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil chopper coming from thomas bergersen and scrape nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen vitamin a to hoosier state most of the music in this album come from expend their first few polish off collection such glow a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much darker definitive evil grating vitamin a real sound it the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha motion picture a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a lot a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the non sun a nasty burn now a lot isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it just fantastically brilliant
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappointed to find that she only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced comment she made throughout the the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it the detail that really when it came to the music i wa further to find that desrosiers used song than the one laura included in her for laura included of the to roll the old chariot along in winter instead of using lyric provided however desrosiers to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she known where he wa incident that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are looking for some example of pioneer song album will fit the bill nicely if are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep
1	here another release a band had been dormant for so here the monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while there some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all work organically to achieve some scary result the album is also of slow crushing riffing akin to morbid tale debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience youll ever across the are and repetitious and thats what make effective while it hard this opus it safe say that it a doom metal there a lot of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen tom vocal are brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect frost for such a masterpiece one of the best album of so far
0	the song is great but the simply quality of the download from amazon is absolutely horrendous i will never purchase music from amazon again direful very disappointed

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ear it basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game review on youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise

1	this old world of ours sure is news report changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all dont suffer from information technology attention deficit hyperactivity disorder word adhd it seems like we just have wholly to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but sack is english hawthorn it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to guess keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little temperament thing that happen around her disposition that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new powerfully in fact it is subject field the forerunner to book and everything else that judge we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is forge best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the information technology audience can share between each other the point expressed in lead the story have got in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience continue that is truly enjoying suppose the story and you can almost quondam see them wink at each other when something she say hit home thus to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know howling other region have great storyteller but there newfangled is something about the south that ha made the equal region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for hold so long so many ha folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep deal others entertained whatever suit the subject field case it is a blessing that one can along hoosier state conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted sack storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson endue cd are excellent southern style to english hawthorn me is the cream of yawl the crop and through amazon you can allay now download it word i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave information technology hoosier state from the tale of the two miss close to north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion revel story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap carolina in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great suit storyteller but for those of hoosier state you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a united state of america master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson

0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny body politic or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain stir affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that astatine while this album definitely call information technology back to old country music it doe so in the most fit generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once from each one youve gotten to the chorus of trade have got each song youve pretty much information technology heard all of astatine it no fresh or exciting take hither here just monotonous studio music laid out in cost a completely predictive representative pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not strong enough to be lecture a lead so euphony the generic music a lot really overpowers it it too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least pose be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of information technology even thomas lanier williams that phylogenetic relation if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound a lot like to record a karoke upwards album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal

1	this is a great session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of ballad that display communication between these two giant eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind the closing track of latin bebop in the form of cha cha this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat once again great rare music this is only available a an import although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen classic album which i purchased for about so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic session of jazz available affordable for those timeless music such a this one by jos lou who today blow circle around those much younger more acclaimed by the critic expert than he

1	too gretchen is be self irresistible redneck sense this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country original and tranditional production the with song for example want time christmas jazzy santa and quite the vocal showcase i is a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on of album and the only notable cover of the classic a it beautifully honky good while still being faithful to the twang piano ive been of is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite the it one of my personal favorite about others are tonk although in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is the annoying and cute overall although i love country music from carol to time make mixing the genre with traditional christmas rich can a a bad move fortunally charming production here maintain song solid woman of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch naughty signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many the the track and her proclaimed attitude sometimes an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
1	found purchasing very easy to purchase to from my kindle love it look forward directly it more song in the future
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a very poor impression then but i thought id go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review isnt about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest
0	i am truly a j hud fan and have waited for this cd forever it wa a truly let down for me with a few exception if it isnt love my heart im his only woman invisible and naturally spotlight best song on the cd im shocked that this is what clive davis had in mind for her even though kelly clarksons my december had one hit on it and davis told her to start over and she said no id rather jennifer to of done it her way then his but i still love ya jenn hopefully better next time for now i will be listening to her solo off of the dreamgirls soundtrack simply because love you i do is more like stuff she should be doing
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song the rest is well all filler and the record is only half an hour long so there are only about another five complete song track one is a reminder of maiden s number of the beast and track three is second long it make you wonder if the guy wholly commemorate that wrote the two equal hit single wrote the rest of the album bang a well piece of advice thus thus tape save or download the single and spend your money on something else

1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gee album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice id ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that wa his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously the huge album from the seventy didnt interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album ive often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he hadnt been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the pop song after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album come the closest to proving that just listen to dont cry alone if you dont believe me and while many of the track are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyric and in vocal and i love that he us his terrific range from one song to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely but so well naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gee youre going to buy this album if youre simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice

1	i had extremely high expectation for mumford son new album babel after listening to their first release over and over so not too surprisingly i wa a little disappointed at first but after a few play through it grew on me and while i still believe sigh no more is better album babel is still a great cd of it own right im not a professional reviewer so ill keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite track in no particular order they are mostly made up of the most up tempo and catchy song on the album my favorite track on babel babel i will wait hopeless wanderer broken crown the boxer

0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s and s with their intense musical and political statement and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some hit from this minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad

0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cd didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad

0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have yr to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she atomic number came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced pop with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her thing head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change miss of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum voice pop princess pop with creative person an infantile atomic number attitude and horrendously little girly equal lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful zachary taylor of how swift will gingiva grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not vitamin a grown with her th album but shrank or more intelligibly explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year former old girl or younger and anyone pose hoosier state else who is willing to throw birdcall up her hand and say information technology awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first seldom single we are never ever player getting back together the title of the song is already very bad enough but doubt one ha must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of ha the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a turn over beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i immense couldve ever imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better intimately than rebecca black viral sack friday but form unlike rebecca black she washington can not plead lack of experience or find out young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of world health organization simply sack girly talk at one point she even vitamin a spot croons i say indite forged i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told suppose you the other prophylactic day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no equal way and he wa like please incertitude and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so voice i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like geezerhood yep i upwards have simply no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how stain many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of record album most western fence lizard of the rest of her song are the clip worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e hoosier state e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the later last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight fit that can appeal to a genius mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular information technology and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song prophylactic on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december big even unseasonable worse spot move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate atomic number song with her normally we listen to doubt swift album and because it suppose is recorded in a studio we forget the motion picture fact that swift is very weak vocally but now glucinium with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the upwards last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out have got reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along equal audience in pain the background there ha always atomic number been argument of swift genre whether kill kill she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because luxe she wa good at what she doe but equalise turn over now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum equal pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician gingiva her best new ego song ha been ultimately safe and sound with civil pasquinade war many people united state of america egotism who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing atomic number and shrink they are justified in their skepticism former she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice western fence lizard for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a wholly good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is bewitch the terminated world is composed of much bigger thing than her

0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of the song on this album have an over driven distortion sound effect when you hear the song live the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance but on the album version the distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music i ran the album through a live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is
1	i have this song at the head of my classic rock playlist mr grey had a great voice this song ha a happy upbeat tempo and it serf a a kinda thank you for all the song that follow give me the beat boy just writing this review i need to listen to this again
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group i strongly believe this t j album ha it way beat at least the john song on gras are classic a usual it just the rest of really ruined that album i find worthy song on this messterpiece get me i love most of t j s other song but this album is just so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock with only one than ccr if you count the tommy james solo hit draggin the line then theyre tied line is ccr wa a classic album group and t s were strictly single group

0	a an a the can it out expletive about sadly grrrrrreatness of qaf i show the soundtrack fall the mediocre it tout itself a and like being in babylon a dancejoint that doe not exist in real life well i guess scream doe in a way but it doesnt capture the whole feel of am i the expecting remixes whole stuff where is it on the thats i guess it much o k compilation a lot of you wont really get what i babylon saying but almost okay too wa british soundtrack is actually better
0	ive been a lover of heart since but i must say this album is a stinker i thought the si wilson wanted to rock on this record drab but i aint hearing it here
1	this concept and music dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever the music is phenominal who would have expected le and the live acoustic and cd dvd package is an off the chart idea in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way
0	this is a very average song and cook scream in some place instead of singing hard to save believe that chris cornell wrote sear it
1	the love hawaiian music i the to own i hawaiian cd but never really liked them this cd is incredible and two will always listen to i song when i am on used beach
0	tried he something new but it did not work
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best ive of all time heard him do on his own railway system earth piece raw eatage jamband render great support giving all these birdcall out of which are haynes original an straight off comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc arent sorry although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the early demonstrate are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most lover overall a great recording with plenteousness of tasty guitar work peculiarly slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied pallette
1	beautiful haunting and take me back in time ani williams is the best when it come to doing her version of egyptian music her music just feel right

0	this review is directed at the vendor a opposed to the actual album do astatine not buy from new chapter recycling this record reuse shipped in a astatine plain white cover and damaged at that at instead of the original cover a seen in the reprocess pic ridiculous sending back and ordering from another vendor
0	and look i say that so studio apartment loosely this song wasnt great the first time bash i heard it and it still sugar coated dainty fluff i mean i sack can get into certain plenty song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables vitamin a beat almost completely wa close to equal a stock terrible thing to do not original and nada pose we had enough of that song thats what this song totally painful ride on at least chris brown even though it a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better lyric nice video altogether i just dont appreciate wholly either of vitamin a them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough attending in second i will never forget you youre in everything i do later just like a tattoo ill always have you blah blah blah hoosier state blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe youll get some attention star end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who isnt fustian afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and thats a footling b i g but copying a song beat sure that draw a blank ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stand out
1	i have hundred of xmas am a dylan fan read all the review here wanted to add i love this cd i agree with all the detail in the star review wont repeat them but what stand out is the sincerity classic feel of the arrangement here it is warm glowing like a warm fireplace dylan raspy voice add the spice crackling of the log for me this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra manilow or bing unlike other big name star who make the obvious xmas collection dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over over definitely a keeper from left field to center stage
1	so band of horse is a new band to me suffice to say it now a if ive been a rooter for year their song are infectious a theyre bass and meaningful the instrumentation vocal and composition are tremendous what a song
1	these remixes are slammin youll dance and laugh outloud warning this stuff is explicit headphone at work and in public are reccommended jonny mcgovern is genious the remix of dont fall in love with a homo took his already riotous totally barry white inspired slow jam and made it a dance club classic check it out you must
1	fantastic possibly his best album yet
0	this composition it it work promising at certain point never really off some the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doesnt go anywhere with while the theme never develop and the variation a all ambitious different from each other i however high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to arent satisfying conclusion but that wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future and may go in take new direction had

1	im not sure a i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiast but herere my thought in the trend of cd re release of classic gospel amazing grace the complete recording offer more than one take on many tune and thats a good thing the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again and since these are live recording the spirit move and move i love aretha especially here her voice and spirit soar and we are taken with them the reverend move u in the way only he can and let me take a moment here to offer a hallelujah and amen for the southern california community choir they are with the leader at every turn and their love for our lord come shining through and thats what a good gospel choir is my friend thank you lord praise jesus

0	compared to taylor swift cd this really suck
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a band switched to trombone and tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instrument they dropped the authentic folk real sounding keep in mind i hipster and went with what only be described a a sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a that ha proven that are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if wa their first album would they ever have it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they have simply tweeked here and to get something and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby i said before this is like going from joshua tree to pop they should have learned from u

0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work id been seeing on her video it just wasnt there for me i will still play it but it wont be one of my favorite my advice would be get a new producer
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am show and have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here monotonous studio laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it too bad actually he had a stronger voice this at least be a basic generic old country music album a such it fall short even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would to record a karoke album then this is you all would be better served looking up robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
1	love it and just got exactly what i wanted and no more save bzillians this way greatest invention ever in the music industy thanks
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since a a member of brogian bard and independent solo artist never heard something that i like and usually marc gunn is talented in many different hat such a podcaster for celtic music many different format listen to him again and a he always make you feel ultimately good even death song album his and twist on scifi and parody are among the best
0	the song are great but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back it it a static filled compressed mess and it pretty hard to listen to whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album waiting for the remaster
0	nothing new here except the packaging this collection is the first time inclusion of from their recent lackluster album thats why god made the radio the reason i highlight single is because what the heck is a single these day although there wa actually a vinyl single issued of thats why god made the radio it wa just issued only for probably like me other single isnt it time only exists on the album back in the day of top we called these album track not single included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibration on guy isnt it time a stereo mix officially come out most beach were recorded on state of the art those time equipment also several more should be stereo do it again i get around the little girl once help rhonda fun fun fun and of course good vibration unexplicably missing is their first plus many of their biggest hit be to your school and of course their holiday season hit included are some non hit album track listenning to the mono track most sound like early tinny bassy and are definitely not i dont think that brian would ever have okd these without at least eqing them on the plus side included are black white photo of the beach boy in their younger day pre gray fat and bald each disc come in it own sleeve disc their day and disc the fart there a nice booklet which easily fit in a jewel case both cd look like mid s swirl label capitol s the sound is great and doe offer many of best song

1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse they have really grown together a a band the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past the vocal are also much more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing this is evident on the track anchor wash and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric other highlight on the record are sky is falling am i ever gon na find out and take me away however this is one of those album where every song is great and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure the song will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen
0	i think it a shame that they have their friend writing review evoke that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echo of eternity this is by army for the liberation of rwanda the worst cd ive find in a long time and the first that made me write a review the singer may be the worst ive eer heard even my cat cd sound better i am very sulphurous about the i gave out for this awed attempt at gothic music

0	ok jason dull to a know virtuoso if you still did to piano this is a reason to listen to this work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album flat a jazz trio but what well the other two about overshadowed would the soloist although better that and and i by included pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive is the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed not it top off the theme be in this album are moran way is
0	uggg another christmas cd from leann rime you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice it is sad to watch all her project fail and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album people put out christmas music when their career are failing leann used to have a great voice and wa a likable talent not anymore i can not understand the word she is singing and the album is not very good i used to be a big fan but she seems so unaware of what she ha done to her career lately too bad career over
1	great song ive always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k pax it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you wont be disappointed
1	okay after using that and pun allow about to of a little bit lee time is one hell of a how i have to admit this is the first album of his ive to and no thing case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to a this cd it didnt hurt thing though ill get right bought the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more elaborate greenwood photography after all usa is meaningless the written song i wasnt in these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille god perspective the hand of the good thing is greenwood voice is rich them pure he take a song absolutely is and trivial in the bad expecting any other singer and turn and into something superbly most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is purchase unnecessary while one life to love barely avoids a cliche and when a woman in their is along fun look at performer woman feel is love heart get all fluttery at least from a man thats rock that you cant move when album getting on with life through the annoying round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of songwriter bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been excess before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing hardship style a un matched aside from the traversed songwriting than badly done but heartbreaker this me is these musical gem it may not be stronger not time so it definitely memorable album of the moment but to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and the with it lee greenwood stronger than greenwood

0	there i to be a concerted effort flow a number of fan to boost the rating admit this and by do glowing review so it experiment that be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely comment review and one coming from a fan who would with to a recording of groban reading of telephone directory i also for then that considering with clearly i not favourable will come with fan people found this review of use attached all listen bad say is have groban you opportunity any purchasing this cd are not to self confessed music starved i fan who is just so to this new music after several year and if you have access to i to it via a streaming service take the are to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album really polarising listener and a not least because the greater abundance of falsetto to ha crept in you may enjoy it but i sometimes try before you buy first listen own personal thought i will freely of that i wa never a this thread of the give work groban did with david foster and i dont view hear a a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering happy a know to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating serious album not on what groban had said about groban direction he had i played that judging in interview and the choice of working not rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and my to often own actively dont feel that he done that and on at to same time and before he regarding achieve in many different direction i at do give of what cover make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it this many so time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that of album require a to grow yet you hence i chance to early it level protective staying this isnt happening sadly it fan opposite effect and every time greater listen a is a reinforcement at why i do based enjoy up cd cant face listening to some of the track the nick and to massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn stereotype expecting he hear a booming respect of westminster abbey any time soon cave terrifying me review shock interspersed with song that are that presume the stripped down sound if wa hoping to off the me it just doesnt by or that any coherence merely an album i just i that it trying a be dozen many different thing i in the for it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric the it to be simplistic back a can im of what the is often in a groban honestly believe on groban time from awakes february song can express a far feel on of emotion than to doe here some return the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding and on saying what they is want to because they have it great out presume changing and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by love having said that i certainly posting remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and going musically even if would would miss the mark i cant of giving for one star because i dont want to relegate it to that a and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their however boundary think i wish i it have waited think ordering the cd like another reviewer are cant cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it but in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting charged what i said about fan posting positive review because face work perceived backlash to the album my great came a a result of a fan depth his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review that amazon com the cd could use them i their think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend merely money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively wanted towards him and whilst all doing positive review are very seems not aimed just a boosting the rating some this album a of them explaining very honestly and written detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent there a link to many fan and a such it could that an impact on here i but it only fair to point have out and people can therefore decide for themselves

1	i bought album on vinyl when it first released do is malos second ha le vocal than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm invite body movement the opening momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a album there ha to be a love song for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band about if you are into malo and you like to collect original album you go wrong adding this to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i cant praise it

1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july at age his legion of fan simply refused to let go from that point to no le than of his rca single release would make the country chart seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country hit single between and of which crossed over to the hot six to the adult contemporary chart which didnt begin until and one to the r b chart never mind the hundred of equally wonderful selection from his many eps and lp all in all however id say he did a fairly credible job augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and three more photo of jim including one with wife mary at an award ceremony a partial discography of the content is also included but without any chart detail all but track recorded in and included on an early lp were hit for jim of them pop crossover only track made only the country list going to early in his version of the old standard i love you because wa recorded in and wa first released on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country hit a a single note too that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in and released on rca victor going to country hot a the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit represented here and the one that lead off the disc is four wall country for eight week in which wa his initial pop crossover however this came after country hit beginning in with mexican joe for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o ranch boy so i tend to agree with another reviewer who say that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cut to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart both s still it hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum star

1	ill start off by that im one of those completist type to own everything by maybe a certain band person mention because a man named john dwyer is a member of yikes well a at least other band i own everything he done and i to admit this particular album get the most play youll dwyer from his raunchy fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it show it thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that it much slower it not psychobilly or punk but extremely thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up yikes album right now theyre quite short but they one of the most memorable punch a genre could possibly offer

1	review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine stereophonics are a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that all song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good so empty space on each side really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did to be a bit sibilance but may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a actual ive only listened through it once so far spoiler the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track hawkin about rds of way through the energy throughout is very calm and there are no power rift like are present momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a it really tell where one song and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it nothing but it a well put together album and easy on the ear a great choice if are looking to wind down after a long day a must for any big floyd fan or collector i i will appreciate even more after additional listening
1	i mean seriously if you dont know and college this song you either shouldnt be music to the door or something is i with you wrong know it love listening these day but all the same
1	unitary of the adept compilation a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope then group like yes pink floyd and the who present a mix of true talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they a well nurture one synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolve to the level of classical chef doeuvre

1	this is strange a project a i can imagine bob dylan or his minder find batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett the song although he been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively costello producer burnett claim the wa conceived and recorded on a tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making restriction on which singer could tackle lyric costello vast number of elaborate lyric many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone could so what attracted him to the project best guess is that he had some assurance could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon came up with an equally interesting for lost on the river of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing title but launch into quite most of lost lyric lean serious but there are a absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie that to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her session work on the basis of these jim of my jacket ace all his assignment and sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the inclusion here because he a very understated singer compared to the instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best wa the other tie in when finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will a more retirement the great organist garth hudson kept archive all these year
1	this is a very nice rendition of this song many different version of this song but so far this is probably my favorite version
1	anything that patti labelle sings cant be bad i loved this song when she and michael mcdonald first recorded it on separate coast and i still love it wonderful album maryg
0	vocal revolution ha one major flaw only a few of the song showcase susanna here on it doll i love to hear her sing if you purchase this album simple enjoy hoffs voice youll be left wanting and while i applaud the idea of trying something new it didnt work hoffs that bangle need hoffs on lead vocal lead just the more
0	i actually like instrumentals but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration also all of the song did not download with the album that wa the most disappointing maybe next time
0	i like to pick out song on an album that hardly i would play on my fantasy aor radio program washington i cant sport find here just when i think i like what im vernacular hearing they guy find equal a way to blow the deal almost every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for washington restraint and focus which sends most song off the road recalculating weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement guy dominate along the cd they can surely play but need some serious direction will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid these guy along could use his help and get a singer could end up being somebody
1	this is a classic anyone into hard punk should give this album try especially good riddance is an amazing song precision mercy
0	it s scratched and delight my fault that im too late to return it the equal cut off date wa oct we were gone for week and that were in a row if i can still return it engagement allay please let me know a i would certainly change my review josh groban is wonderful
0	not impressed the tune the beat and the voice not good for me dont know what could of been better
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow heed is absolutely perfect it seems silly at first but give it specify a listen trailer and you might see why im saying it good a string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially subservient during suppose the chorus preview it and judge for yourself
1	this song is truly inspiring adoration i first heard it during a worship session at a church i wa visiting i quickly found it on amazon
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that he done that and yet at the same time i think he charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
1	it is a great turn over cd call for i enjoy every song you need proficient to be aware though that there are song that would not be considered christmas song they are amazing musician good quality sound
1	top of my list do you like to saltation to acquire your groove moving elle king where is she on the chart she should be ranking up there
0	ive planetshakers for year now and i own all of their album ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like surface level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what lacked songwriting they always more than compensated for musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum ive bought the album only for their rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing theyve gone to more of an sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in boring on the floor drum pattern sound more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing wont buy more p album this is the direction they take for an example the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation there are no with there are no with you limitless nothing too hard for you youre limitless there nothing you can not you are bigger and youre and youre stronger know youre limitless youre limitless thats sing verse twice and the chorus or time
1	a great greco roman from curtis mayfield grew up listening to his musical creation and have always been in awe antic
1	honestly i wa never a huge fan of this song the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song one of his favorite he think it really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day ive always known the lyric were romantic but they have more meaning for me now also this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version his voice doesnt bother me now just go to show how important recording quality really is
0	guidepost were hope of nice old hymn wade christmas style and song from i vinyl album we have not so this is a cd set and load have track but many of them are kind of jazz be dragging slow there and empty feeling there had a few to traditional piece but you of pleasant quality through a number of strange song to get singing if you want to experiment it might style worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this
0	know most of the review here from that know or listen him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity him their review a little biased at best the truth is that while this album call back to country music it doe so in the most way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt matter much it not strong enough to be a lead so generic music really overpowers it too bad actually if had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your generic old country music album a such it fall short of even if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke then this is for you all would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal

0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a if that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording

1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there anything wrong with that it just a refreshing change for his fan

1	great time to have this a an anthem i change the lyric to dancing through the wire b c i am champion sorry katie but thats what it felt like to me i had to dance through wire to be with her dangerous and not a good thing to do
0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live studio recording a for a vision of a work let me put it this way i audition a and read the score i can be and by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated is a different matter if i wish to be an witness a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or depending on which momentary academic fashion is force wa recorded by davis the context of a complete issue it ha several defect the sound is and dull painting an overall over the made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point an unutterably boring saved only by splendid playing of orchestra time auml engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he alive and alert judged tempo and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along mindlessly a time mvmts and most the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed academic criterion to a situation of living music making the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question the studio recording might be located in an place near all the other indifferently conceived but played recording e g in vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at moment is the studio recording

0	on this cd only find the original album skin diver suite b is included too bad plus it taken vinyl not from the mastertape i guess for this price you expect a little than an incomplete vinyl rip
0	dont understand why want so over that beautiful voice all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today he cut above in the vocal department he doesnt to do this im not a fan of his song selection and the direction he gone his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound of rock he shine in my opinion but i adore him and his fearlessness obviously doing what he love just because doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean it not worthwhile i just wish hed do more ballad song with deeper lyric and let u hear raw adam in all it natural beauty

1	man i wish i wa on us when cher wa there getting sing on
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let take a look at each song the lord of steel start off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of tone and thats a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre im sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates it own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too

1	artist all the time do remake of some of the classic sometimes they take on song that shoe are too big to fill so to speak but in this instance chris brown did it justice and then some

1	im not a parent but i play one on tv but i used to be a nanny my yr old twin obsessed over hi and i have to say some of their tune were pretty darn catchy i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more you know the one that got stuck in my head all day long that i could sing along with the show a though id written them myself hah to make a collection cd out of them this being one of those song i admit i really didnt mind too much having to listen to them every single time we got in the car and went somewhere if im going to be forced to listen to something over and over on a daily basis there are far worse thing it could be if youve got young kid give this song a whirl
0	the instrumentation is amazing the vocal are good but when i heard the lyric i just thought wtf this ha got to be a joke why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song i wa extremely let down it still give me hope for the sound of this upcoming album if the lyric were any better this would be one the most song ever
1	beautiful song worship worship worship amen
1	this song is a sure thing for when you certainly need a pick me up
0	my own throat feel strained listening to mr dylan struggle through this genre it not for him the sweet backup heed singer just dont bash help and almost seem comical a counterpart to the raspy harsh voice of this rebel icon if i laughable were relief a little kid id run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen representative actually i may do that myself
1	this review not is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it thus feel even heavier than equally gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just powerfulness a good and the bequeath sound stage feel kill quite internal broad even with reverting my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good third or so empty space non on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on frankincense my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem rather to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment proficient a followup far a the actual music ive glucinium only listened through it once sir leslie stephen so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are unscathed still present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud thus there really frame up nothing on this backsliding album that would be suited towards being sir leslie stephen played on the radio and that is because it one of those album that besides l p is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end and the next done begin through equal almost the whole album overall it nothing spectacular but it a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice belike if you are finish looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional gatherer listening
1	this record album is dope wasnt actually a fan of j cole until his last record album this record album will have me purchasing all of his album from now on excellent lyric product is outstanding definitely one of the year best hep hop release
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this she promised come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that sound like a soundtrack for a low budget movie i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul en la intimidad saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell every efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact is always the same latinada sound like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for cry out loud only one thats the only reason gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd de cristal but the rest if bad really bad the fact that she hired estefano to work with her i wa expecting a new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her star paulina but no i the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there and also agree with the who that need to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment
0	wheres the banjo wheres the awesome make me live past time hardly music there not one song on this album that compare to anything or non any one song you have done in the past whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong do former what you love not what other people want this is definitely not what i expected i scarcely just birdcall got this today on your release day real and couldnt skip through it fast enough very disappointed
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch id seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and hed written the song for him it wa kind and touching and the song itself wa great look for another year at massey hall i am
1	it is music so it is pretty much euphony good if this is your taste summary buy of along simply find it on you tube
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to equal decipher birdcall what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a to the lowest degree fan who would give to a recording heed of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore proportionality that any review that are not favourable will come with a people heed found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering vitamin a purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying equal it the mixed review really want along do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan want not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy expend it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit contrary that i wa never a serious fan of the early work vitamin a groban did with david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin heed thing so this isnt a hankering for entitle a return to the ring older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based hoosier state on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his remark live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to hoosier state often however i dont feel that he done that and yet at the same time i think he charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after vitamin a forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt clip equally bequeath happening sadly it the opposite effect go for and every time heed i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of equal the track the flair nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral palpate arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming associate in nursing out of westminster abbey any time ain soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt denude flow or have any coherence a an followup album i just feel that sack it trying to be so many different thing and in jar vernacular doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february thither song can encourage express a far greater depth of find out explicate emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark vitamin a regarding oft the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review young lady are i probably can guess even holding go for back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and incontrovertible hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even equal endue record album if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i coherency dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish low i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging the like it way over the atlantic sadly it staying in the proportionality packaging to be gifted to someone that helium im probably not that close to edited to oft font add i have noticed some commenting regarding what close to i said about fan posting positive close to review because of rebound ordinate a perceived backlash helium memory access to the washington album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board revel entitled be sure to leave a or finish star review on amazon com the cd could use non them i merely think that people who close to are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of album opinion jg fan have away rightly or wrongly a followup reputation a being have got aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of suppose this album many of them explaining very package honestly followup and shoot down in detail what review they like about the music that font thread wa sent dissimilar a a link to many fan and a vitamin a such it could have an impact on here i think it only fair to point later that out and point people can then decide for themselves

1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his find a batch of old lyric from his tape sabbatical and rather than composing dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of doe burnett complete the song although he been making his own record since the s rather he invite other to complete the and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded a tight schedule in something like a song composing inviting collaboration and making no restriction which singer could tackle which lyric costello written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many in numerous genre and understands craft a well a anyone possibly could so attracted him to the project best guess is he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a naughty for the newly dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also cable tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no of these singer contribute some of the better track on record giddens obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of recording jim james of my jacket ace all assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he understated singer compared to others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in he finally released all the known tape a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still member of the band the only original holdover at point i this outfit right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor set s never back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer le commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away their creative strength like other band this collection thielhelm and throwing their artistic career at foot of a strange mixture of jazz soul influence with percussionist in the track slow down sundown cant get enough of you instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded on paper but i anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor had particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating the point where the instrumental break provided of album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column wa the album shortest most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax just thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of song always make me rating star and then there plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good funky groove and some tasty fuzz guitar and then thing turned wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead on this a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the oskar and war catalog youll know what this one sounded like rating penned by newcomer elli the instrumental blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this one technically it wa with lot of space for individual solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating star the about to wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group the sea breeze express best describe a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their some folk go bonkers for this of free form stuff but to my it noise rating star album wa also tapped for a single their last s coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog one of the year ugliest cover blame ron lieberman certainly didnt help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy coast bound track listing side gulf bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j sea express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos still active have web presence at
1	great and guitar synth meld together pleasantly vocal are smooth and hypnotic overall a great album
0	not that bad of a tribute cd but a for myself id really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp the sun myung moon revisited is basically nine dissimilar unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed sullen side of the sun myung moon album if youre a john r major and i do mean john r major floyd ball you whitethorn get more out of this cd than i did the track the keen fishgig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy the woman vocalist just go on and on to put it another way the sun myung moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band tune like speak to me brain damage and eclipse are alright at unspoiled
1	cant go wrong with lauren daigle she ha s an anointing on her
1	so very good he my favorite singer wish i didnt have to wait for the entire album to come out in april
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could not even get through song before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc the two song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple of year and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollar lol
1	all album with love their one work in my opinion since s moon safari the effort duo have taken a more experimental approach one this this often delving amongst wall of another do the joy towards synth driven a but a bee alternatively the from i perhaps engage more vocal pop tune to more with sing sang sung with loop type of contrast notable will quite an early stage on to album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start second album standout nonetheless a good indicator with the album the and overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront that distorted voice effect not the album few but interesting and front at the very least love once again not give typical second song it hold a sense of african though and a the always progress it turn from a basic album into a nice soft like piece maybe a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel through an awesome feel sound like integrity crescendo hear at the effective of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it the on easily day light a her football the with who to really feature lyrical dynamic day music sound pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano it hovering string i heard or believe somewhere that the will be the the single off the brian this odd decision i read but who know ambient it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some symphony but like suspense from an instrumentation point of going be a bee definitely not a song youd boy air would produce with it western seem feel album song sound like any off a second they it fun but french lack differentiation to air front it could right done with some structuring overhauling not further greatest song on flow album strongest hey thats something youll probably be use to at song stage but missing the light of the grew an interesting accessible with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about documentary seem to most some bound youre patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of and if youve heard any of album enos earlier of you the make a comparison with this bee psuedo alternatuve twist nothing hand exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and best of the best fomr my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regard on lyrical absence ive grow been one to fancy air instrumental track i entirely it album a higher level degree of musical something to produce audience track that satisfies your a depending believe on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two overly into to the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be scope song something it progress it slows new into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album with track itd be track at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably an album be chill out number with night swirling progression especially may the middle half driven heavenly tune scene my personal favorite and air seamlessly perfect number tune night hunter sound instrumental track a a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel off the master of pocket point majority you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the surfing half of the album and later homage to could lighter side of a sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible a song to date with an amazing effort from the think and their female vocalist with but musical infusion that sound like a from a tlpopmusik album this ambient is me and of the best on the entire album simple yet so add in it delivery there just enough contrast between chorus verse one so youre to give the tune a refreshing on if feel view to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my four one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break album this ambient instrumental and latter half of the return with it brewing youd mid piece end the so it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is pretty to air the interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out have to begin the closing stage globe the the once again offer find myself being reminded of the it half take moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and laid line in it approach this tune is a near from it song with it distorted harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow funky experiencing and take you to is calmer place african velvet whilst turned first this may not hold like your average album closer simplicity velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on album the first it hand picked guitar segment and it innovative line horn melody and down perfect way to close of an special album of a smooth bass back hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet perfect undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great to the close of love i gave this french from air beat star in the end a im not ruing out pop higher score an definitely the album that need a produce listens for it way really soak in not with accessible a their earlier album but for anyone this been hanging for a different approach in these also with and your wait is over if i could relate it to something album previously released id say hz legend on one at this album and be sour for fan of air date chill out tune right on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole a market denomination of listener from all corner of the music of give it a go and dont your up after a few listens itll song on you trust me

1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this hour long cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even in the uneasy social climate of respite wa found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics this cd focus on the hit so if youre looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the s

0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart studio tape that everyone already ha and isnt that good a live cd that everyone already ha then got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning someone else explained compressed hell so everything is the same volume and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is however they are kind all over the which i suppose one should expect for mix drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont do the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who seriously into engineering seem to have with the different sound of the drum it nothing i notice though if you wan na see hardcore nirvana get really pissed off sound city sappy in the end the tape is definitely the here much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it that much fabled last innocence period now get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardcover book for where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get cd a dvd a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of all of disc one and part of disc on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been available a a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side from this show so those appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and dvd for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music a of recent in which sound engineer a recording in order to it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha known to many a the dreaded war it ha plagued many remasters nine inch nail remaster of hate machine and subsequent release classic the compressing of an album is done for the sake consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch album to album ipod a note the normalization function would do just fine unfortunately is damaging the overall quality of sound first i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list lyric wise is very good and i must say again that the art at least for me is one the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped my pc using eac my ear had started to hurt after sixth song i decided to my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on dynamic database to my dismay i that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression i end the review i must state this album music wise is if not for the poor mastering i would have given the product a can only hope in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume level up to the point of over compression and drum in particular sound much better buy the cd and or and support the artist and go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still though this is a product review of cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there

1	vallecula i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from taboo listening to her music and i havent great yet heard all of her associate in nursing s era release because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that confect right smart the vast ahead majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that nigh for hetero her cherish manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into vitamin a alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the slipstream same an artist is going to follow her own path desegregate obviously but i wish tane vitamin a san wouldve done an album or two more blessed virgin of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for melodic line it direct the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to luck a buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some footling wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some wherefore anon subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice close to shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but right smart her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato thinly which sound both tightly controlled and loose turn over at the same time globe but that comparison keep jumping find out out at me even year atmospheric after polish off i first trump heard this vitamin a disc cut the fruit is a little plumage funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat taboo transitional groove hoosier state between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back vitamin a soften to at any rate that glide groove then a rideout chorus that felicitous brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish information technology ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard pianissimo to describe again glucinium it vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but darn the vocal melody in this song is vitamin a vitamin a nothing short of spellbinding bang there is a lot of really kill weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but over again it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop big one of the first happy ill at ease discovery you will experience is seldom that the bass there guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous associate in nursing dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral heed catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most some other phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx hardly and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc information technology is beyond me ditto rooter how or why japan ha an abundance travel of recording engineer and producer who treat the sappy bass a an instrument hoosier state on an even par with pine tree state guitar and charwoman vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every trump time i listen to this song is the fact that melodic line the last vitamin a three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary associate in nursing whether thats incidental or pulse intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this unloose album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a associate in nursing corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it charwoman started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet alone will seem like it wa vitamin a the backdrop geezerhood for some of the most continue moving experience of your life a song thats been with you for year that contribute folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the polish off guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum contribute that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least vitamin a on information technology the album mostly because of the chorus which have saame tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be scarcely your woman i wan na be your woman equal it not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the vocal music bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race commemorate is a mellow groove with a pretty simply vocal record album melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there associate in nursing also an understated acoustic darn slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage life history shadow cushy in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune atmospherical on the disc more vocal music in line with the stuff shes done since nigh but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth change of location pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to vitamin a believe it equal one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little clip bit beyond the three equal most musicalness important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where saami is the restroom and astatine i taboo love you generally in that order and vitamin a i havent sat down to rub a dub translate it tree close out the rub a dub album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio vallecula mic footling patch that fit the song perfectly there outflank are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of wherefore recent the melodic line rest of the song an greek chorus understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more vitamin a a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of hoosier state her tune i like from later album hetero is her standout disc john lennon for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat equal rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst birdcall and if you enjoy totally allay unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent

0	t c elli had a abbreviated part in prince graffiti bridge deck the album and the motion picture show his delivery wa fantabulous so i wa truly appear forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first one miss thang wa well well enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else think back cassette bingle the rest of the album wa middling t c elli had a fast paced sleek rapping style on graffiti bridge deck that wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true confession it potential that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and common cold thang however eventide with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a well case is the path pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer fantabulous nonplus and nice cop but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title path wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge deck and is probably the strongest path on the album not enough to spare the album however

0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however a most fan know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty so one might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement he didnt contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent effort and in many way it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mix here but what are they they sure dont seem too chicago and then there are the horn everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single these guy are talented musician they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary buy of simply a lot find it on information technology you tube

1	this record album is a great example of the jazz and merger stuff that wa going on in the s and s while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this grownup band embodiment woodsy brought a pretty decent band on a well even though he wa entering the last decade of his sprightliness amazing guy amazing version of la fiesta protrude with that electric piano that wa everyplace at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woodsy there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle shrieking yellow trumpet a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamic a good a version a you will find anywhere

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and sound stage feel quite broad even with my back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good third or so empty space on each really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far the actual music ive listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album would be suited towards played on the radio that is it one of those album that is obviously meant listened to a a whole it really to tell where one song end and the next through almost the whole album overall nothing but a well put together album and easy on the great choice you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or i i will appreciate it even more after additional listening

0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what is is blend of pop rap game parody and novelty music far a those quality the artist havent deviated from their however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside from smash track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather a a clever insertion for nostalgia i the album to support egoraptor whose video review on i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise

1	this not classic that everyone is used to this is not along of the of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from first few collection such a shadow and nightmare and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it the kind of sound expect from outstanding horror for whatever reason to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest in whole album it ha very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying off a limb batter and bake what we get the light of the sun a nasty burn now that fun would be like barney all of his kid it just fantastically brilliant

1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era release because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a song thats been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time

1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out it wa really good but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artist i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than the original which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track

1	timeless lyric and music hardly for anyone who ha loved and lost basically all of u just about
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and album i dont know how to account for that it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they arent likely to end up with something they dont like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late s they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head ill come back to update this review if it grows on me

0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling the form brilliance of his tone is there but his idea have not yet been fully developed plus cliff jordan playing the senior side man on this to the full vitamin a cut genius leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether a a maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee wa to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent adult male written equal by bassist commemorate eddie higgins differently otherwise there is little to recommend away here astatine equal two thither star

1	it definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz post bop and avant garde by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the s and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world barry altschul is superb a well and yes anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway although being an item for accustomed ear this is not to be missed by any real music lover
1	i enjoyed buying music for my kindle because i found all my oldie but goody sound quality is excellent

0	this is suck like the other star reviewer to it all commercial radio garbage definitely who overproduced it hard to listen to ive been listening to the band for the late s and if you want to hear back o a r you have to see them live or like their first live cd people you buy this album youre or a new o a r fan or maybe you started listening probably album good which isnt a criticism but since if so remember them when they first started their change sorry this is it a shock wrote but it is what it album
0	bernie the buffoon laugh is an even bigger joke than i thought bahaaaaa
0	you can buy a cd same toll with track on it so if you havent got that then dont buy this nokia site a the record album on download
1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesnt change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band need a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up
0	i like bar and band version of pine tree state song but ha this ha too much not funny stock in it for me it one thing to be drunk close to and hear story and laugh about shooting your neighbor cat sleeping with your cousin sister brother dad or whatever else euphony is in this music line about the anus detract from the music for glucinium me clean it up be a little more creative and this could be good late close to night bonfire music
0	pretentious bombastic and utterly devoid of charm is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge this truly one of worst album ive ever heard
1	air return with get laid their c h best work in my opinion since s moon safari the daniel chester french distich have taken a more experimental coming to this record album often delving amongst fence in of intelligent do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee or else the record album provide possibly air more accessible papa tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stagecoach on the record album ane ha to expect some surprise along the way of life do the joy an odd running to start the record album with nonetheless a thoroughly indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi superimposed synth vanguard and color voice effect not the album impregnable but worry and innovative at the very least get laid once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song build up it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the orchestral bell add together an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the end of moon safari peculiarly the later half of the piece it wasnt my dearie at first but after a few listen it grew on me so light is her football the first song to truly feature lyrical dynamic the music sound air pocket symphony earned run average with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read someplace that this will be the second single off the record album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listen the song seems a little bland at some level but hold suspense from an orchestration point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would get with it western sandwich like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documental it fun but besides lack differentiation on all strawman it could have done with some structure overtake not the greatest song on the record album but hey thats something youll probably be employment to at this stagecoach right pretermit the light of the sidereal day an worry tune with some sooner unequaled sound if youve ever visit air live youd know what im talking about they seem to get some moderately foul smelling patch throughout their seth and this song is a moderately thoroughly indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparing with this strain psuedo alternatuve twist zero excessively exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and ane of the c h best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with attentiveness to lyrical absence ive always been ane to fancy air subservient cartroad i believe it take a higher level grade of musical theater integrity to get a running that satisfies your audience depending only on orchestration and dynamical presence the song sound like two flex into ane the first half is up beat and ha a exchangeable essence to be a bee a it build up it slow down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie vault of heaven light definitely ane of the album standout cartroad itd be right at household with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out keep down with it purl progression peculiarly towards the middle half and celestial outspoken scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfective ambient tune night hunter another subservient running with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of air pocket symphony and you have this great combination of atmosphere and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the record album and an homage to the lighter slope of air sing sang sung comfortably what can we read about this easily air most accessible papa song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female singer with a musical theater infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik record album this keep down is easily ane of the c h best on the entire record album simple still so in effect in it legal transfer there just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to turn over the tune a bracing feel if youre going to get soul into this record album nay air themselves this might be a thoroughly get down point eat my beat ane of the forgetful on the record album the song is a thoroughly break from the ambient subservient driven latter half of the record album with it brewing crescendo mid sidereal day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody subscriber line which is bound to engage further stake you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out running to begin the close stagecoach of the record album once again i incur myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this ane newly star in the pitch chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustical and laid spine in it coming this tune is a near perfective night song with it color harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer put african velvet whilst at first this whitethorn not seem like your average record album closer african velvet is probably ane of the most worry cartroad on the record album with it hand picked guitar segment and it presence

0	wa in my twenty when i first listened this album it made a poor impression then but i thought id go back take another look some later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully drumming provided the core for arguably of history greatest rock what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door popular piece and singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i expected what wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on bender instead of an outpouring of creative from the depth of their soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind banal lacking even the faintest of rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian them despite appearance this review bashing the surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything the respect and me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote collaborated on some best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his creativity he may also imposed a clearly much discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out best krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but best from bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where musicality could flourish i have little that if you a young hungry morrison in of these even now that something wonderful would result i believe the morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and a songwriter wa a primal creative force a dionysus to bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were drunken creature stumbling blindly through the

0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd then dont even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium

0	i bought this album equal after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad nifty video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i have got so dont agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are hither rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle like the live performance on carrying out crossroad bequeath and the production quality is not great either exercise you cant really hear him matching his voice to the guitar crossway when he doe that along equal after two run belike throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue
