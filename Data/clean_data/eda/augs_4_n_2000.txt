1	i have seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus sure from shredding to melody long drawn out for each one piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get opera house why a this ha been billed spell all along a a rock mouthful opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me

0	first of all let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day i am not one of those classic fan who hate the stuff in chicago is one of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some hit which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that should have been it for the that period of the band they then spent the next year releasing various compilation and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not that we could get the point in where next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx like a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely use of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the sound of band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able create any hit single with it in there could have another hard to say i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there is not much at all to on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile in the first place it doe make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their would like see is a return and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let u be honest even a lot of the material on their early record were not great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they do not to which is fine but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album
0	the song is dead great but the quality of the download from amazon is absolutely horrendous i will never purchase music from amazon again very disappointed
1	excellent recording i can not stop hear to this once i bought this i got all the other master in this series a well

1	i did not grow up with this overturn kind of music in the predominantly african american church that i grew up in but listening to it now make me wish i heard stuff like this earlier beautiful lyric and jesus christ it is all lifting up the name of jesus christ
1	peachy song the live version i think is better an the album version i do not think this song got played alot
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice only one for kanye wa absolutely awful and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney four five second is absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the worst song she ha came out with and she need to really find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need much stronger for her next work and she wasted her own time with low gimmick song d

0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so is going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will with a people found of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity listen to it first before buying the mixed really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in may enjoy it but i would try before buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of early work groban did with david foster and i do not view a a foster v rubin thing so this is not a hankering for a return to the older recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i do not feel that he is done that and yet at the same time i think he is off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a time or so when i would rather have left alone aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this is not happening sadly it is the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and can not face listening to some of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song orchestral arrangement london hymn i am expecting to hear it out of westminster abbey any time soon terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doe not flow have any coherence a an album i just feel that it is trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a i believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding reaction of laughter at lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly remain a fan and he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss the mark can not face giving one because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i can not cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it is staying in the packaging be gifted to someone that i am probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting what i said about fan posting review because of perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on to what could be a new to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of album many of them explaining very honestly in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it is only fair to point that out and people can then decide themselves
0	did not order this
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each outshining last one swift would even prove doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is with big girl wisdom that anyone nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be disappointed swift ha not grown her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we never ever back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this however luck ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let u just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but rebecca black she can not lack of experience or young age a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called up and he wa like we make up and i wa like no way and he wa please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something i did not like so i wa like we never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst have heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to song her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is timid sing along audience in the there ha always been of swift genre she can be considered country or just pop and it did not matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that she still country her album is not even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her
1	will put you in the mood
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise is very good and i must say that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my using eac my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely if not for the poor mastering i would have given product a i can only hope that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that is an unmastered version floating around it essentially the mix without volume level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there

0	doe a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought angstrom unit medication not so energy department let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music dissociate scene it would not have continued to evolve much finish le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to regard music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain need a an essential lupus erythematosus influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man constitute who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit construct that on the whole make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it is that is how refuse easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared indolence alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he is been anointed by lampoon his fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he finish wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to non finance his similar heroine habit a modern musician and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to constitute incite a revolution for spoiled middle past class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail helen will moody could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to choose from medicine i think the you have given in to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so that there is nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him mass medium on the whole and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy
0	but this is a poorly give rise cd both the computer enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solo and the overuse of vibrato in the solo make this a definite disappointment
0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true confession it is possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
1	an excellent series with a theme that really capture the sense of the series definately recommend especially to lover of the series

1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper cross file and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle cross file track and were centennial state written by vitas track and written by him alone total act sentence is i simply adore this cd it is hard to imagine sense of hearing it without being energized by it abundance of delight enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it is impossible to weft a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a lower limit of a vitas like many performer especially those from distant land is plagued with pirated disc play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad where is you there is me kuda ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoe do not proceed silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno fathom unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible instant try not dancing to this one i dare you in brusk and a t shirt proceed those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor in this one street of the capital a pollyannaish bouncy song with a breath of that upper cross file i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in this one just techno fathom and the voice a instrument

0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval include consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the end album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with a dissimilar producer leslie howard stainer steele of meat fame what that mean to the listener is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall transonic output and who also happened to be one of the in effect guitar player songwriter in the business wa now out the door to be replaced by maybe someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le cheer notion so what doe the first non atomic number produced trooper album levelheaded like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my darling by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover liken to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their in effect seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had give up themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh blab out about a pyrrhic triumph although by s ten they had started to kick some a again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doe not necessarily take any more credit for their success than ra songwriting but sometimes it is what a producer will not let the creative person do that is just a important ya know

0	nothing new here except the packaging this collection is the first time inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album that is why god made the radio the reason i highlight single is because what heck a single these day although there wa actually a rpm vinyl single issued of that is why god made the radio it wa just issued only probably collector like me the other new single is not it time only exists on the album back in the day of radio we called these album track not single included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibration come on guy is not it time that a stereo mix officially come out most beach boy were recorded on state of the art for those time recording equipment included are several more should be stereo mono track do it again surfin safari i get around the little girl i once knew help me rhonda fun fun fun and of course good vibration unexplicably missing is their first hit surfin plus many of their biggest hit like be true to your school and of course their holiday season hit also included are some hit album track listenning to the mono track most sound like early cd tinny and bassy and are definitely not remixed i do not think that brian would ever have okd these at least re eqing them on the plus side included are black white photo of the beach boy in their younger day pre gray fat and bald each disc come in it is own sleeve disc their young day and disc the old fart there is also a nice booklet which could easily fit in a jewel case both cd look like mid s swirl label capitol s the sound is great and doe offer many of their best song

0	no this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c is not a good a she wa on car wheel true i have always liked spirit lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent moderately album in the borderland between country blue and rock her life ha not always information technology been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it is a double cd only track on each record most of them way too interpreter long a if adding a washington few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out information technology of it sure she mumble but that is completely not really the main problem she ha always mumbled all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and strong it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i three fold feel i computer memory have heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a care minute jam session gone horribly wrong there is even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce tape of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad some review inward praise her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested washington and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of bear add together root music it is the sound of old beer inward tired muscle and autumn rain it information technology is the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing exactly musician whose spirit is fading and the only sir thomas more thing left is to get done with the job ha lucinda finally lost it infinitesimal have all the year of washington boozing and shorting finally taken it toll threshold this is supposed to be a concept album of the information technology highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked her previous album where well she had more than enough song to make it a double i inward liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused religious belief of blasphemy for saying so and in a world wa where good and original songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that one lucinda ha it in her this one however wa just a big yawn to me
1	good monetary value
1	what a great song the fact that my daughter angstrom unit love it a much a i do is george vi a bonus the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done and modern curious george is pure greatness

0	i am very disappointed the phraseology on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original artist it is not it is a mix sung by a wedding singer sail line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be publish with remake of original artist song without the permit of the original artist hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song very misleading and disappointing

0	home for christmas sound innocent enough but you would be well advised to stay away from this home it is a horrible place you will be asking santa for some ear plug if you purchase this cd alternately you can buy it for people on your christmas listing that you do not like or just plain hate how bad is it some say that the cia used it to twisting hardened terrorist suspect in guantanamo it had them babbling like baby in second but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland go ahead and buy it if you must after all the man ha a private squirt and he is got ta wage for that squirt fuel somehow
0	a nice album comprised of track which have already been published under the how the west wa swung series by wr record vol through very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best of compilation if you have bought the wr record series you do necessarily need this album

1	eer the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing my daughter wa devastated when i told her the news she always wanted to virtually see the band live and this song it wa both our favorite cranberry song the song haunted my dream the night washington she passed my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang she wa obviously proud of her open heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her song and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound if you have never heard a cranberry evidently record this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound
0	it is right
0	first of all you can make out most of what they saying the production value are i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with sound buffering lining in fact i am pretty sure they recorded it on a year old webcam and mic set up using sound mixing emulation software that obtained in a cracked version secondly the message stupid they do not really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band about this album wa a waste of time this is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover there no way the music wa to sell this album
1	emmylous voice is a good a it get here and i wa amazed at the synergy between her and rodney these duet could not be better this album is stellar

0	what can i say it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album apparently there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here what complete jibberish how can you ask someone to pay an premium for the super deluxe version and then not all content for release while i love to say i am shocked mr taylor would sanction this it is apparently one of the many new le than desirable the record company have espoused lately to get those few of u who support physical medium to shell out more dough disgusting
0	i did not enjoy this album a a great deal a the previous album
1	i will start off by saying that i am of those completist type i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a man named john dwyer is principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he is done and i have to admit this particular album the most play you will know dwyer his raunchy day of coachwhip he did yikes right coachwhip and it show it is extremely thick reverb soaked madness but the catch is that it is much slower it is not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff with dwyers indiscernible wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes album right now they are quite short but they pack one the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer
0	trash scum with disgusting text and poor music

0	i do not understand how serious yes fan can consider this angstrom unit fly from here to be a real yes album step back to the real world dude this nothing is indeed nothing else than an album that could be better titled a drama vol but this time the performing band name is maybe hey but what can you really expect when there is inward no more jon anderson and rick or even his so talented son adam wakeman back in the full gang in addition trevor horn ha buggles ed the music once again this fly from here definitely only ha the cover art another excellent work of the maestro roger dean of a yes album the music really in that location record album performed by the band maybe and zero star

0	i will start off by saying i like blink and also alkalic trio when i heard skiba joined the band i reckon we would get a awesome mesh we did not i thought tom washington the problem with the band but it seems to be mark very mediocre effort there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy i get that the album is named california but how many time do we ask that coerce down our throat and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore let u grow a little

0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it is a shame what pas for hip hop these day people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all because lil wayne is whack i am not a hater i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he is just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pa off a hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music

1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured in film i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my day
0	huge wz and rz here this album is a bit disappointing some have equated it to an ep and i agree i believe overcharge is believing any crap he put out there is cool well it aint love john playing and hope overcharge put out more serious word and music next time
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the there wa a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist which i am guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label name a list of the song and not the order that they are on cd i not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a higher register steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same go for dirty world the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor that is completely missing he not miss altogether handle with care make it a a slower tempo ballad and he manages to keep the flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i would think he rocked but a whole of this one is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise i would label this for completists only but i am a wilburys completist and is i wish i could get back
1	perfect for reminiscing affordable esay download and i can carry this part of my past with me for whenever i need a blast from past
0	not good
0	this wa a gift for my daughter for christmas so i can not reexamine this item
0	bad eddy voice is shot
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal i love to hear her sing if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice you will be left wanting more while i applaud the idea of trying something new it did not work here the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal it is just that simple
1	this is a very nice rendition of this song many rendering different version of this song but so far this is probably my favorite version
0	sample track sounded great but when you listen to the total cd it is one monotonous song after another had high hope for this but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune probably will give it away if i can find somebody who want it
1	zipper catch struggle wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think if you are stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album is not for you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and occupy lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i the like of girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices album the others being flush the fashion and exceptional force all three while they do not match most of his album deliver the hard rock good while drifting aside from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the ane weak moment for me is the painful radical from the course of instruction of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
1	some good music from the past that get only light current radio play i have not heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly most of these will not get much play year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get chart quality song not heard much today
1	this is one of those perfect single it is so simple but so close to flawless dave gahan vocal even the s synth keyboard sound all work to create a flawless single that even to this day remain firm the test of time a must all around
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly vocal are smooth and hypnotic overall a great album
0	i understand this song is supposed to be all political and inward one deep and whatnot but her over again voice and the sound of this song altogether make me want medicine to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that i never have to listen to one second of this song ever again for a long a i live i am very diverse in my music taste but i hate this song i really think this is the worst song ever to be released in the history of time
1	love ryan adam and now i love taylor swift i bought both cd
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a what is your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
1	this concept and music dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever the music is phenominal who would have expected le and the live acoustic and cd dvd package is an off the chart idea in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way

1	i love this cd every single song it is one of my all time favorite i feel like a couple of the song are straight out of my life highly recommend
0	i remember liking this song when it wa popular yr ago really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era and since am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune she flat out every few bar she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average overall kind of meh

0	i bought this version before saw that the u s navy band had also recorded the irish national anthem the navy band version in my is better more
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album i blaze away have never been a big fan of limitation their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and restriction similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level conception they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey illimitable real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song in that location have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum i have bought the album only for their edgy rock grease one palm sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing they have gone to more of an tug electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring membranophone on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what you would hear in a disco very disappointing i will not buy more p album if drill this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the illimitable shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless i am saying goodbye to any limitation i am saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit eer with you there are no limit with you you are limitless nothing too hard for you you are limitless there is nothing you can not do goose egg you are bigger and you are greater and you are stronger i know you are limitless you are limitless and that is it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

0	this album did not do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cd and love them to death it is too girly and poppy for me high pitched are not all that clear and do not mesh together to mean one thing most of all the melody of the are hard to listen to you know how some song are just difficult for the ear to enjoy these song are fine most the time but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling song though control secret and star from the rest get about star i can not relate to them much and i do not get much pleasure from listening to them but will always love tbms older stuff and their newer hide and seek
1	beautiful album
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to
0	the cd did not play i purchased volume and volume but volume doe not play and the paper and receipt not saved highly disappointed
1	we just got this for christmas and it information technology is a wonderful cd my four year old is asking great question about the song

0	those that have followed grace and the noc this is a disappointment grace is much to talented a songwriter for this this is an artist like picaso doing a paint by number if you liked never going back v song with meaning like apology or big white gate this is for you gone are song with meaning soul truth blue replaced by techno i m the guitar riff between scott and benny i miss a piano solo like star i miss a rocker like ah mary or stop the bus the influence of neil young zep steve miller stone and janis are replaced by pop singer yes every artist ha the choice to pursue and grow every fan ha the choice to buy my prediction will be a nocturnals reunion in the near future i waited week to post a review to give it a chance to grow it ha not
0	this cd set is okay but get a little monotonous after a while i wa slight hoping it would be better but it is okay
0	i buy the song because i wanted to hear it with both bryan may and luciano pavarotti and pavarotti doe not sing it

0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything it is a dreadful recording and the vocal on nd chapter are down right ear piercing not in a good way i remember being so much better then again we all thought early christian rock folk music wa delightful
1	have hundred of xmas am a dylan fan read all the review here wanted to add i love this cd i agree with all the detail in the star review will not repeat them what stand out is the sincerity feel of the arrangement here it is warm glowing like a warm fireplace dylan raspy voice add the spice crackling of the log for this cd like xmas a much a sinatra manilow or bing unlike other big name star who make obvious xmas collection dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over over definitely a keeper from left field to center stage
1	so band of horse is a new band to me suffice to say it is now a if i have been a fan for twelvemonth their song are infective a they are deep and meaningful the instrumentation vocal and composition are fantastic what a song

0	frankly i have no idea what the no more other review is trying to say however i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of level constitute and not the version you probably know from the radio if you are a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this read rendering might be what you are looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive

0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time and one of my favorite artist a well so i wa so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song but i wa horribly disappointed when i heard song i really expected better from her than this in the past i would have bought a shania cd without bothering to preview it because i knew that it would be really good if not excellent when shania finally release her next cd i will preview it first and if it is a bad a today is your day i may not even bother buying it

0	this is the most overhyped annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the and just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa nobody fun any more if a band the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the stuck in the well if making music for entertainment purpose only not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an thing to do then the is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing in the i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden alice in chain cd and i burned them and then spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all ditching my grunge cd i do not recommend nirvana or any grunge band to grunge is the most depressing music the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself cause depression and suicide do not poison your mind with this garbage stay away from grunge

1	first class excellent
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch genuinely of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on be the information technology album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing saame here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the genuinely listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner flow here is a song that compose is just meh not a song i liked before and still tug do not the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try breakthrough and write the past same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because i am drunk it is just a watered down version of remarkable secret of the bottle i do not get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs suitable the song sound silly with lyric commonly rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven stay fresh by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound unitedly out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but washington you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doe not genuinely seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i have not given up hope and think jackyl can constitute still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of constitute album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
0	i seventy seven people also did not this and it up in their order not a way to promote a band
1	i love the arrangement on this collection many of my favorite easter song with stirring instrumentation a good collection to have

1	wonderful contemporary arrangement by gary bonner of these wonderful placement old standby hymn
1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this is a very band using very instrument and the lead vocalist hour angle one of the most authentic old school type soul voice i have heard this year these are all pilot birdsong too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourite though including the fantastic unfastener never bequeath you lonely hope too high breathe love maybe i am not the man evil woman which i am sure u the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country though this is not acknowledged they do not know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the foetid closer it aint over this is how music is hypothesize to be take a leak and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa take a leak back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can
1	i love this song i can not get it out of my head guaranteed you will hear this all summer long
0	i bought album for some old i remember the playlist the correct song title but the song that play is different song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite when irish eye are who put the overall macnamaras band etc not really what played very strange but a waste of money
1	stick voice
0	i do not hate the music i bought this piece because i loved it for year and to hear it reformatted but the recording i purchased is somehow scrambled like different track are playing out of order in some place not what i remembered at all hope amazon can fix it
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then spent the next year releasing various compilation live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there is not much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let u be honest even a lot of the material on their early record were not great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they do not want to which is fine but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album

0	im sure because of the extensive time served by encompassing all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life encompassing during war this song and it lyric are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience and a shame to the troop especially those who have served in parade combat per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self control and were mostly just complacent killer

0	ruined a perfectly good song
0	we tried two cd and neither played in our stereo not sure what is wrong with them but we could not get any sound sad my year old mom wa excited
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since a member of brogian bard and independent solo artist and have never heard something that i did not like and usually loved marc gunn is talented in many different hat such a podcaster for celtic music in many different format him again and again a he always you feel ultimately good even his death song his take and twist on scifi and parody are among the best
0	the strain is not being sung it is an orchestra playing the subservient given it is not what i expected i rated it star but if you are into orchestra and instrumentals you may love it could play it at bed time
0	when i gave this album star at one clock after hear to az then hear to this a thought hit me in the principal like a mike tyson punch this album is a bad a it get first off this guy bite off everything in his site the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die just longer the only rationality why he is famus is because he got shot clock and he is a fool on stereroids he is all over the medium and is an annoyment on mtv and bet in any event on the album his lyric are childish and baby room rhyme along with a lame horrible flow with good beat but putting him on the lead made em sound bad he is a million mile away from being pac and ja rule ha a good take a chance of beating him if you like pop rap odds are you brought it and after learn this review you hate me but for those who like real hip hop understand this is garbage and is doe not even to deserve to be called a rapper from queen na az and mobb deep cargo area true to the queensbridge name it is not even worth cent itself it doesnt even deserve to be on the shelf interesting fact this fool dissin ja rule yet he is copying jas style i mean he ha a fake gangsta double and nine song love song and he acually sing song imitating ja rule and too he used pac rhyme on the hail mary remix from tupacs song hail mary and against all odds to dis ja while using tupacs rhyme for exploitation what a laugh a discrace and a malignant neoplastic disease to hip hop just like chingy juelz santana he ha good beat but his rhyme are completly senseless ludacris g unit j kwon bow wow and u know who else peace

1	a ok
1	can not go wrong with lauren daigle she ha s an anointing on her
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of cover of marilyn monroe covering happy for jfk it is even above that silent night one that wa re covered hundred and eighty time by nashville alone i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior song
1	i am sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i bought it for but alan jackson just doe an exceptional job with it

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good band with a livewire athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in early day when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best loved his and the musical chop of the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever possessed ha long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad the way that many so called rock vocalist of the were bad in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited appeal a they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than harder he doe not even try to get the lyric or phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the public
1	this album is a great session by the angstrom unit jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of bebop ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha cha this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat once again great rare music like this is only available a an import although now you can get along it in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen classic album which i purchased for about i am security industry so glad that the market across communicating the pond is making these classic session of jazz available affordable for those who like timeless music such a this one by jos papa lou who still today blow circle around those much younger more acclaimed by the critic expert than pry he
0	i just finished downloading from the cloud and there is a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window medium player nothing happens the name doe not even appear in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too long window will not even let you rename them in the normal way update i have found a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you like but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it is finished file repair solution a i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the computer take to get to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe that is character right there which leaf character for the track name now let u consider the name of one of the non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio mp that is character so the total is character well over the character limit window just can not handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation mark that is character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual file go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given above you will cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new file name from the example above which is character you will see that you end up with a total of character well under the character limit of course one wonder why did not amazon think about this and use a reasonable album name and file name without duplication in the first place my conclusion given that at least four of the track are not relaxing and you will have to spend at least minute screwing around to fix the file naming error imho this collection just is not worth the trouble even if it is free to begin with of course if you are really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them
0	do not it doe not have vocal track in the mix it is a straight up repeating beat when i previewed it i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample after all it list all of the rapper in the artist column wrong wrong i just spent a buck on half of this song thanks a ton whomever came up with this idea

1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this time of day long cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam resist and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even in the uneasy social clime of respite wa found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rapscallion the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance mortal ballad lalah imply i love you by the delfonics this cd focus on the hit so if you are look to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to body build a thorough music collection from the s

0	i need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you look up the word music class separate brass professional and you displace will see chicago anyone who know me know that chicago is and ha practise been my favourite group since dirt hand down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every album and every cd twice my key chain say chicago my exactly refrigerator and front door ha chicago magnet inside and out anything with put together the chicago logo newmarket land on it get saved need more proof of my contempt loyalty this cd saddens operating theater this loyal fan to the point of heartache i did not say anything when this group started re issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue i figured improving number they earned the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of bear drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group world health organization really worked hard both rest in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vibrant part of the music scene wish it is pull in not easy to stay current for year and please everyone when the new guy came on the scene you did not hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera wa gone jeff wa in and that is that i did not ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath and frankly i did not want them to even the drummer tris imboden wa locus musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but folk this is not right chicago ha more talent than this part of me non want very hard to salute them for being there for year the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and consanguineal day information technology chicago and all medicine the christmas song that i have already bought year ago i simply do not know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well if candidly you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my mom said that if i did not have anything nice to say then i should not say anything but i am not getting a warm block fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and can not wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the shade and bolt the door and turn off the telephone thank goodness i have other chicago album to listen to better luck next time fella maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen

0	song were dissimilar from what i heard on youtube
1	one of the realest rapper in the game right now j cole ha never disappointed and this album is no exception forest hill dive is his best album to date and best album of for sure
0	beyond stupid even more stupid and irritating than actually having phone
0	wile i am sure it is just right for some folk and i like a lot of cajun zydeco music this one just did not do it for me i actually did not keep it deleted
0	frankly i have no idea what the other review is trying to say however i will issue a constitute caution to constitute anyone considering purchasing this track notice even so that this is a remix of level and not the version you probably know from the radio if you are a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this might be bear what you are looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive
1	here come the mummy are wonderful their music is exceptional make you want to get up and move i have missed this kind of music it is hard to find now day and it is original the lyric are also very original they one are funny and full of innuendo if you ever have a chance to construct see them in person do not information technology pa it up
0	wow what a load person of garbage if you watch the movie the music might make sense a a stand alone experience constitute without the visual side to accompany it the album is an epic fail the cellist dave eggar might be accomplished and all but that doe not really come across on this album and if you are a established fan of amy lee proscribed or evanescence there is nothing to see here amys vocal appear on maybe of the whopping minute the album play for the one song amy wrote for the album push the button is easily the effort wish worst track sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot behind the dj in ibiza it is completely out of place peradventure on the album a a whole stay clear of this piece of crap
0	am sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great band like killswitch engage in flame a i lay of god ect now thats real music not this crap the only reason guy even popular is because he got shot nine time in a few year rap will die just like disco then metal will the world once again

0	some of you may wish to bribe this chicago album because unwisely like me you want to mind to the music and birdcall of the guy in chicago but you get to mind to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jnr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only birdcall out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if you unwisely like me bribe this album to hear the band play you have to mind to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan miff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum john brockman drum and mind to the vocal of shelly fairchild varlet flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball chief joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago extra musician and birdcall writer were necessity to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incompetent of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am glad he had some merriment but i wa not paying to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to mind to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the frequent not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago compact disc i am not referring to the quality of music here which is strictly a affair of personal taste but good or defective i wanted to mind to chicago i do not mind if i do not like the birdcall a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the producer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and book it own music only a name to milk a they did with chicago and but former armed force worse this meter i do not mean to shock the taste of those who find the music on this compact disc pleasant enough to relish it i do however mean to shock that unfaithful producer jay demarcus who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his discourse of keith in particular is almost unbelievable invitee guitar player he ha not lashkar e tayyiba keith play on at to the lowest degree of the birdcall and he ha not lashkar e tayyiba tris play drum on of the birdcall this is a jocularity not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the son he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad jocularity of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love life for decade should have known better after a thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what bequest and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable from any out contain from any of the album from to written and performed in great part by others is an vile epitaph for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their gourmandize under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of moil if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a duet of nice piece here that you might relish such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a mind if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will relish very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to guardianship who made the birdcall and who played them and you will whole love life the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some good playing by some people just the sort of birdcall you enjoyed on those other album and good product bribe it and love life it

1	these song me way back and i feel like i am right there with him when he sings the song are uplifting
1	i have seen it written that great art divide and that is surely the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly dissimilar for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out piece with little focal point to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it surely a star exploit from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this may be a spinning top exploit from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	i have been a fan for many year this is a great collection there is only one course i do not care for and i will skip over

0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after delight his sitar prove electronics work i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style so far i have had only moderate success hybrid fart that travel name should have been my first one clue if we are even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker recording i exhale could not find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i did not look too long before i convinced my self that stone ticket the bonk german word on the front cover of one the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem angstrom unit then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction the music struck me a st century german pub constitute rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until bonk you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar mister peradventure bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment angstrom unit to my review

0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is great a usual simply but the lyric will lose you there are two song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the rest of the lyric are just hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all erg ay spontaneousness caramba one note samba la la la la bamba or jolly springtime oh the jolly springtime in the merry sung month of may oh the heavenly alexander melville bell lanthanum hour oh the come again capable day or the elementary bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl she is about to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very spring annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and joseph deems taylor spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i do not know but i had to listen to this radiation diagram cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about

0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of year ago delayed a my review may be it is sincere i am a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one of the best band of the bosstown rock scene i had been looking frontwards to receiving the cd but when it get i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the start of every track i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the start out of iris record i suppose i should have call for them for a full refund but i somehow opted not to do it
0	agree with other reviewer these mp s are censored and should be labeled a such

1	beautiful great acoustic great lay
1	great song i have always liked crow so that is no surprise you would but believe me i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice this music during the end credit to the film k pax it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year the music itself no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it is just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you will not be disappointed
1	bequeath i just love it the music is will done

0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol i had heard this song on the radio probably too much and decided to download today based a snippet i heard today i have to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now given the whole chris brown thing it me feel disgusted about him in general but really this song a sappy love and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo i know you can sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal to a lot of people just not me just my opinion

1	great quality super fast download
1	big third day fan and this did not let down
0	i just finished downloading from cloud and there a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window medium player nothing happens the name doe not even appear in playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too long window will not even let you rename them in the normal way update i have found workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point just one glaring example where is brahms buy this a a general sampler if you like but not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it is finished file repair solution a i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name path the entire route that the computer take to to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you these amazon will put them in this path document and setting all user amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical in the universe that is character right there which leaf character for the name now let u consider the name of one of the non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op ii andante un poco adagio mp that is character so the total is character well over the character limit window just can not that workaround after you have downloaded the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation that is character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window let you rename the individual go through and chop out all duplicate information in the example given above you will cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new file name the example above which is character you will that you end up with total of character well under the character limit of one wonder why did not amazon think about this and use a reasonable album name and file name without duplication in the first place my conclusion given that at least four of the track are not relaxing and you will have to spend at least minute screwing around to the file naming imho this collection just is not worth the trouble even if it is free to begin with of course if you are really hard up for music that maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them

0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album i have never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian president andrew johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum i have bought the album only for their jittery rock effectual with this new album the blazing guitar and polish drum fill are missing they have gone to more of an electronic effectual with a little lead guitar spit in and boring on the floor drum pattern it effectual more like what you would hear in a disco very disappoint i will not buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an instance of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the deed of conveyance racecourse limitless i am saying goodbye to any limitation i am saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you you are limitless nothing too backbreaking for you you are limitless there is nothing you can not do you are bigger and you are greater and you are unassailable i know you are limitless you are limitless and that is it babble the verse doubly and the chorus or time

0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar coated fluff i mean one i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my apprize nerve first copying irreplaceables wizard beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not sufficiency original and we had enough of that song that is what this sufficiency song totally ride on seed at least chris brown even though it is a similar beat ha something going for his song measure with you better lyric nice video altogether i just do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though sorcerous come on we heard it enough get under one skin in second i will never forget you you are in everything i do later just like a tattoo i will always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe you will get some attention star end note beautiful voice but get a vocal music new producer who is not afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and that is a b i g but copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i constitute mean nothing besides the vocal wizardly work stand out

0	sum ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the reason would like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song actually at least close to punk but besides that nothing really appeal to me rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i do not suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back

1	it is a good cd
1	the best cd i have ever had
0	this is singing a a younger artist still have not been able to the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song still an awesome and tear jerking song though
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first bequeath there is the music the song is fairly simply solely yet build in displace a mid s constitute era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a what is your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in take heed the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can expend drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of chief the song be it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song angstrom unit but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha think on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the taper get under one skin page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
0	we ordered early and waited unsatisfying with bated breathe prescribe but this just wasnt up to her usual it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger le universal audience it also felt like she had forced the new song they did not flow and the male vocal did not mix with her voice disappointing

1	use to deliver break of the day newspaper listening to this on tape
0	i agree spirit with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available corner from all the version out there it constitute is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it is a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all mix operating theater appeared either in information technology vinyl or then cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the past instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes
1	this brings me back to my younger year my college day when ll wa still my boo i have grown up since then but i still love this song
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback robin thicke one time pharrell and t i definitly hit the nail on the head one with one it reminded me of something you would hear from earth wind and fire i hope these three collaborate again

0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism the animal third album the first beeing the animal and the second animal track i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job i have heard so far the original punchy sound with excellent bass and repertory good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that redundant sound like beeing re recorded in a bathman plus that supreme being someone put some strange extra echo on the track a complete failure repertoire should fire the engineer and bear give re create it another try thank god i have the original on tape in stereo
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this wa also the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company
0	think this is her worst song ever blah she is so talented i can not fathom why she would write such an incipid song a this
0	all side were scratched and the record would every other note
1	i think this is great album there is not one song i dislike on this i defiantly recommend buying this album
0	this is not the ep version
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beat are horrific probably of the album good i do not see why people are raving about this record because it is not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lack greatness compared to other female rapper and being the face of t i s hustle gang she is garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack
0	it were not so warped it would be fantastic maybe if you are lucky and get another
1	the unique voice of bonnie tyler combined with the emotional presentation of the interpreter song lyric combine to make this a timeless and classic favorite
0	the novelty wear off very speedily a couple of listens and i wa done with it
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compact a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamical range this ha become hump to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha chevvy many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of graeco roman beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency god foreclose little joey need to turn the mass nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame aepyceros melampus evergreen state on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchase the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and evergreen state pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink absorbed digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list the language everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my capitulum had started to spite after the sixth birdsong i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamical range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only desire that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamical will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the mass stratum change state up to the point of over compression and optical aberration drum in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem resolved the two star still remain firm though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there
1	it read omnia enough said

0	this is him singing a a younger artist still have not been non able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song still an awesome and tear jerking song though
1	if you have watched the tv show then you already be intimate how catchy the strain are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length i have not actually verified this but it seems some of the strain on the cd are recollective and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music
1	i am in bang with this
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord this cd is astoundingly well crafted every greenback seems perfectly placed the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music generally this is soft warm lulling music but it doe not put you to slumber toxic girl is catchy jangly and rhythmic without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced spill the bean piano to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it there is a real soothing quality here though that can not be denied fan of low and air should be quite pleased

1	how could you go wrong with live zepp at any price
0	no heart no feeling just strumming on his oud i do not know what he wa improvising but it felt more like koord than hejaz
1	wonderful tune and lyric
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but time this song come on i cringe and die a little inside it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time aside from the fact that the song consists of line of lyric with no substance they borrow the can song and it even more irritating
0	no this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since this or that usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c is not a good a wa on car wheel true i have always lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock her ha not always been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it is a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse make an extra disc out of it sure she mumble but that is not really the main problem she ha always mumbled all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa young and strong it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel i have heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong there is even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what a powerful rock ballad some review praise her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested and stale a a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music it is the sound of old beer tired muscle and autumn rain it is the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about ageing musician whose spirit is the only thing left is to get done with the job ha finally lost it have all the year of and shorting finally taken it is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had more than enough song to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and a world where good and original songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her one however wa just a big yawn to me
0	not even going to waste my output time writing in detail about this piece of trash it is sir thomas more a shame what pas for hip hop these day people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at rose hip all because lil wayne is whack i am not a hater i slip by do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he is just another average untalented main stream clown in this mad anthony wayne giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pa off a hip hop also virtually the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance constitute in my music

0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album i have never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make word rhyme and practise repeat phrase rather than neer dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum i have bought chorus line the go after album only for their edgy drill rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing they have gone to more of an electronic sound with a operating theater little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more tug like what you would hear in a disco very disappointing illimitable i will not buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for operating theater sir thomas more an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless i am look saying goodbye to any limitation i am saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you you are limitless nothing too hard for you you are limitless there is nothing you can no more not do you are bigger and you are greater and you are stronger i know you are measureless limitless you are limitless and that is it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

0	i am a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into decently that lounge lizard act that attempt eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way coalesce through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent surprise foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some approving of the blame around inhabit it is been a long time since i angstrom unit heard any live album recorded constitute mixed this badly i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it it is just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding i am aware live is live but what no mixing board at guess that venue no effort to washington clean it up or separate track in the studio i am really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit i think this wa just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved i am still looking for good quality no more sound video recording of the initial angstrom unit reunion tour this one aint gon na cut it sorry

1	here is some other release from a band that had been dormant for class so here is the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i washington never a fan of the experimental side of celtic language frost and while there is some experimentation in here to a keen degree it all work organically to accomplish some scary result the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest live you will ever come across the song are lengthy and repetitious and that is what make them effective while it is hard to classify this opus it is safe to say that it is a doom metal album there is a spate of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and you will find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best album of so far

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and construct jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit artistic creation hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all bear past the time in front of our eye carolina but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up straight off i do not think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is oscar robertson a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for weave and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is bear the forerunner to book and well everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story quiet and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in topic the non story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when artistic creation something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about neighborhood the south that ha inward made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk commune lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you state download all of it with child because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the carolina two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york picture in closing let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for put down those of you who were not i can think of no better stay fresh example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson

0	i listened to the sample distribution of this recording and washington struck by how overwrought and melodramatic meter crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love ulterior in lifetime after a farseeing relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his lifetime and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection meter voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had clip to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and die

1	these song take me way back and i feel like i am right there with him when he the song uplifting
0	what i simply and invariably say is that when a artist ha to come out with a song they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song alternative for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r b vocalisation and sound in her music it actually ha not actually aim the luff home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album position effect of you is honestly unitary of the worst alternative she ha made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low luff song d

0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to the best album i do not agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are ordinary even those do not sizzle like the live performance on crossroad the production quality is not great either you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run through this will go the heap of that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of area twang and tranditional production the christmas song for exercise is rich with gaudy forte piano and rather the vocal show window i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the record album and the only notable cover of the classic song it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and rather charming it is unitary of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cunning overall although i love area music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation

0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time but still neither is enough to let me sit through song of depression loneliness pining cry in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note but set your failed unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their angstrom unit head or go jump in the river i can not recommend this not even a background dinner music bring back the happy chute swingin need cool seth slide please

0	not a favorite i prefer a more celtic sounding version of this song i wa disappointed in rendering this version sorry
0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look corresponding he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the solid thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine close to his fellow singer crosby and nash he miss the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will likely put it back in the accumulation for a repeat playing once in a while maybe

0	nothing wrong with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it changed in like year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac ha the same setlist two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain era live disc they still perform well but hearing the same song over and on boxet hit package or live album get boring

0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse although second album are known to be difficult i beleived the band to have promise how wrong wa i there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face it all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way but there is no melody on this album worth writing about i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you like lifehouse because of no name face trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy eat world even the calling whose album i also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere

0	pretentious bombastic and utterly devoid of charm this is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge this is truly one of the worst album i have ever heard
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustical guitar and no band this cd is for you it will remind you of tom goad which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it though i have listened to springsteen for twenty year i am not a fan of his pre shadow side of township work i never cared for dylan and i do not ilk any of springsteens solo work if you ilk busa etc you will not ilk this cd some of this stuff could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song i gave the cd two star because it wa made by springsteen

1	this is grammy award
1	good song love her voice love the beat put me in a good mood i downloaded immediately after i heard the song on the radio
0	when i first played this cd i thought to myself that spill the bean the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez then i spill the bean looked at the stereophony cover of the cd and noted the following all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the constitute original group not sure what this is supposed to mean but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to do not stereophony waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else
0	george carlin wa vocation a man who wa talented in many different aspect he unequalled wa creative and every time i listened to his other show i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field this album is not creative nor bequeath funny it is just hateful mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop fireman and snitch are a well a fart and enema joke go listen to something else from his career if you want constitute amazing firefighter comedy because you will not find it here
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection even if you like sinatra you will be disappointed in dylan interpretation if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it very dismal not even good for elevator music

0	wish do not like it
1	information technology love it
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a very poor impression then but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores simply understated but beautifully supportive forehead light beam drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band brilliant what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray stone singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in a lot most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure refutable and basic mood of the song impose this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic incumbency soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song originative title practically scream low brow mediocrity i am horny i am stoned seriously listening to this album i can not believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review is not about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do edward young to regard them with anything but atomic number the deepest respect and gratitude for me refresh this is about solving a mystery completely how could people who wrote or collaborated on doctor of osteopathy some of rock best song have produced something so devoid basically of creative merit my best theory so far is that displace jim morrison contributed something play well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have minimise imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric impose something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply would not accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about angstrom unit musically canonic a fertile world where their musicality could flourish auricle i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now event that something wonderful would result i believe straight off the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a flat songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the along forest
0	it is either badly done or just a really bad idea elvis voice sound rocky i do not recall thinking that when i heard his original recording it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it fill away from his greatness rather than enhancing it i will not be purchase any more of the song from this album i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard do not be cruel and hound dog dog played on my radio over year agone re release more mix of his original if you must priscilla but delight do not do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duet either it is just disrespectful of his memory

1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think if you are stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album is not for you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which outdoor stage at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay finish in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices album the others being flush the fashion and special force all three while they do not match most of his album deliver the hard rock good while drifting away from alices horror persona in tricky favour of alice the constitute stand force play up comic it work recollective the one weak moment for me is the peculiar painful theme from the constitute class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
0	not traditional music very synthesized new native music not what i wa

0	i have listened to this new album a dozen bear or more time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to author his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance more or le from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his completely song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is bear unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer constitute rick rubin is no david foster even though i pine tree state am not a personal fan of david foster play his arrogance is not very love becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with unitedly this console said maybe he deserves to improving be arrogant mr record album groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song the best one have been in need collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in invest various performance venue could lay the ground work for exactly such an album spill the bean yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop take heed and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let u hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those energy department outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by well this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for acquirement interview the next album this doe shine through despite the acquirement haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of clock u to enjoy

0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival and loved every single song based on that i sampled all the love song on this album to see if i should download it after hearing these song i definitely will not be purchasing this album the girl are definitely beautiful all comfortably right it is easy to see why they are so well record album loved because of it but on this album their voice have not matured process enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their later work where they do not sing with little girl voice and their completely song selection is a little more mature

0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time herald worst album by a major rock group i strongly believe this t non j s album ha it way beat at least the john fogerty one song on mardi gras are classic a usual it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album i could not record album find one worthy song on this messterpiece do not get me wrong i love most of t j s other song but this album is just record album so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr if you count the tommy james solo measure hit draggin the line then they are tied bottom line is ccr wa a sung classic album group and t j s were strictly a single group
0	i have been a fan of chicago for the past and i must say i am very with this like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy these were the time in which the band had a of style and vocalist robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however a most fan know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work the late seventy and early eighty so one might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow i am sure jimmy had a part in the horn arrangement he did not contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent and in way it seems more than xxx why could not robert have saved some of his i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there some funky mix here but what are they they sure do not seem chicago and then there are the horn everybody know that the chicago horn the band it distinction while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought and contrived also the cheesy percussion mixing sound of their hot single free just make it seem a if instead trying to create inspiring a they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial with a single these guy are talented musician they do not need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
1	lover of david arkenstone and others on the windham label album is a keeper very relaxing and peaceful while not putting you to sleep i love to work late at night and this music is great for that
1	first of all we have to clear one thing up mean this is her music for those yr although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you another thing many people have say that bejewel hour angle betray out i understand their point of view if you are a die knockout bejewel fan and do not like dance pop or very upbeat music then this standard candle is not for you i am a diehard bejewel fan and love those kind music a well so i wa very very proud of with this standard candle this standard candle wa all about fun experiment dancing and just having a good time so if you love any kind of dance music or pop or most of all a good time this standard candle is definitey for you my overview of the track stand one of my favorite i love the lyric the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome put together really well run uranium i love this song it is a sort of sweet smelling love song the lyric remind me a bit of older bejewel but the music and the overall song is so new and fresh intuition everyone in the world hour angle stick to know this song love it the french accordian and the urban sound together check really well love the lyric a well leave the light on woohoo jazzy i love bejewel and jazz together it go well remember the song i will not walk away from her album this way this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat find uranium wow great great lyric i am sure they will touch anyone who hour angle been in a rocky relationship and is trying to save it really heart experience verse line and angst driven chorus fragile heart at first i wasnt feeling this song and wa like err ick but after a couple heed i wa really impressed really cute and simple song reminiscent of i am sensitive from piece of you doin fine another one of my favorite love it it is just about being give up having fun and takng chance i love the beat how bejewel sound everything great summer hymn become i am not to fond of this my to the lowest degree favorite track on the album i just think it is like every other love song nothing really exceptional and not very catchy in my eye at to the lowest degree haunted the inviolable best song ever so i love this song it is so cool bejewel sings from stalker point of view it is creepy raw and emotional she sound so awesome virtually rock n roll and roll totally different from rest of album i love it sweet smelling temptation good song if light and dark can be present totally in one song this is it awesome beat good stuff yes uranium can great dance song i love how she sings it not inexpensive to bargain your aspiration i am not suprised santana who she wrote this for turn away it he is not cool plenty to pull it off go bejewel uranium me love another awesome song reminds me a bit of run uranium however the lyric are so much better like a girl hymn just listen great beat a well america great message i love controversial bejewel even if this wa a she lamentable a bit of a irrigate down version i would pay big buck to see what the record tag cut get a little repetitive but the awesome lyric save it becoming good song not my favorite though it hour angle good lyric however not very catchy though well and wow another great piece from bejewel she sound great she herself love this album same old bejewel writing the mst awesome lyric just different sound she is doing her thing and you are lead to love it it is light and dark but catchy and upbeat however like i say before if you are a fan of bejewel at all and do not like pop dance music then skip it although i do misfire the old bejewel a bit that is what the older album are for i appreciate her keen sense of evolution i can not even wait to see what she put out there next bargain this bargain this bargain this you will not regret it
0	not what i expecting quite the opposite of what i wa hoping from this collection looking for upbeat and postive
1	very good
0	no skag at all
1	if you not dance you can not help but move to this music
0	i am not sure what those who gave this or straight off star eer are thinking this is awful i realize there will always be sycophant of certain band who are so enamored with them they will always rate star non when it is painfully obvious star are not in order this is certainly one of those time this cd is horrific and constitute that is being charitable i love old constitute van halen they are among my all time genuinely faves bonk but this who in their right mind can give this crap star much le or dlr sound terrible reprehensible i will not even go into the sammy v david argument since i never really cared for the hagar year i love sammy a a solo artist but did not care for his work with van halen but i prefer his mediocre work with them to roth garbage now
0	this album suck like the other star reviewer wrote it is all commercial grade radio garbage it is so overproduced it is hard to listen to i have been listening to the band since the late and if you want to hear skilful o a r you have to see them live or buy their first live cd if you like this album you are probably a new o a r fan or maybe you depart listening or album cover which is not a criticism but for people who remember them when they first depart their convert to this is definitely a shock sorry but it is what it is
1	love it and just got exactly what i wanted and no more save bzillians this way greatest invention ever in the music industy give thanks
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius but he dumbs it down to country on this release i do not know if it is pandering or just plain laziness at any rate it is a disappointment the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world musically it is either country waltz or three chord rockabilly do not waste your money on this one
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i have not yet heard all of her s era release because they are a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because she is good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it is akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there is no track listing here i will do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything i have heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but here is where tanes unique voice shine through it is difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there is a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it is vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if you have spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad that is the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether that is incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song that is like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a song that is been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it is unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it is not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there is also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff she is done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it is one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i have not sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune i am far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still have not gotten around to getting her other disc if you like alt rock that is generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent

1	it is great i love the whole cd
0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded variant the mastering sound overly compress and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the master copy album people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the master copy variant instead the fillip song are great but the remastering wa entirely purposeless
1	outstanding blueish
0	i love these song but the quality of the album wa awful every song clip horribly especially demon please release a better version
1	this is a lovely piece of music sorrow and very affordable at the price it is offered i have no regret about this purchase
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon i just wish would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean can get in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave review puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses to listen to it not trying to jewel should stay confined but just because record sale are lagging a bit doe that mean an artist ha to tap in the pre teen money machine for sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed want to tell u to above i believe some call that particular horizon selling out jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human point of view seemed to be telling u she in her heart i know everyones got bill to pay but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making just to sell and satisfy fat record company we have one britney spear we do not need anything resembling anther one i hope jewel find a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album i would hate to think jewel feel she need to serve her ego
0	it wa not the full dvd that i expected very disappointed
1	i had extremely high expectation for mumford son new album tower of babel after listening to their first release over and over so not too surprisingly i wa a little disappointed at first but after a few play through it arise on me and while i still consider sigh no more is better album tower of babel is still a great cd of it own right i am not a professional reviewer so i will keep open my review brief and just make a list of my favorite track in no particular order they are mostly made up of the most up tempo and catchy song on the album my favorite track on tower of babel tower of babel i will wait hopeless wanderer broken peak the boxer
1	it is a fantastic mp that i can blast into my ear via my mp player what is not to love i love how easy it is to purchase great sounding mp s through amazon
0	i this on accident gave it a listen and turned off saw the video and almost threw up in my mouth this not hiphop probably some kind of wierd rap music
0	a data hook product link linked class a link normal href harvey the dp b z ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf harvey the moonglows a if you prefer original search under the moonglows and you will find century collection among others with original cut and harvey fuqua singing lead
0	i download this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sound absolutely awful it is just way too compressed so it is super loud with a very limited dynamic range almost unlistenable i aboveboard do not think you can blame a lot of this on the mp encoding k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have plenty of mp s that sound fine with lesser bit rate
0	this is cute but very small do not think it is worth the price it is very soft doe not seem to keep kid intrigued
0	thanks indeed to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software i wa trying to virago figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection of doing so or ever heard of the artist very generic song no redeeming quality for me sound like just about everything else out there
1	i wa suprised that this song wa good i wasnt expecting much from an idol person but this song proved me wrong hopefully the of his music is a good a this song
0	poor carry through quality mixing poor quality sound save your look elsewhere
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often interahamwe from modern convention i in person think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same pageboy with haendel and grumiaux quite interahamwe from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein
0	i bought this album thrilling after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i do not agree that constitute this is or star material or performance the song except average for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle like the live performance on crossroad and the production quality fabric is not great either non you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run through this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great player quite but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue
0	to often vocal music and noise
1	it is a great cd i enjoy every birdsong you need to be aware though that there are birdsong that would not be considered christmas birdsong they are amazing musician good quality sound
0	quality is ify
1	worth it
1	this song ha just enough of a mix of pop and funk to sound very enjoyable for everyone who hears it it is just simple and fun to listen to
0	the tune were mccartney the stack on each disc seemed awkward excluding disc there were song included that were to be honest pure junk tune i had never heard and they were poor representative of the career i guess it is a bit like any other mccartney disc you are lucky if you out of ten that make sense
0	evidently the title simple architectural plan refers to a hypothesis that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really do not know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a total deficiency of department of energy with the exclusion of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the three plus year that passed between record album that the group isaac m singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more seeming because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple architectural plan sound like a boy band even when they seek to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballad i intend any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two record album which were in good order effort packed with pop punk accost can permanently be removed now simple architectural plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three plus year layoff between record album or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the deficiency of originality department of energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock grueling than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year this band wa away the scene switch but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin draw near you right next to all those onetime lfo record album
0	the cd control system get star hand down the problem is that there are only track although the cd ha track is missing when you download it
0	i did not realize that i had this song available to me until i saw it in the list of item that i purportedly bought and then when i read the other review and found out it is a free download i decided to listen to it i listened for about second fall into place it off and express joy out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is yes that is why it is free
0	i love the soundtrack to psycho it is one of my favorite of all time so you can imagine how delighted i wa to see this release wa available i bought it a soon a i saw it and wa excited when it showed up on my doorstep i put it on my turntable and wa horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality wa it wa like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs i could not believe how dreadful it sounded and absolute insult to bernard herman classic score so if you are like me and collect and enjoy listening to soundtrack on vinyl do yourself a favor and do not make the same mistake i did
0	i think that i must have got a bad copy because this sacd sound awful it sound like angstrom unit a cd from

1	this music and the lyric lyric poem really are enough to encourage you along the way but the vocal are simply amazing and make it seem so easy not everyone can do this
1	this is one of the better collection out there some very hard to find song on this wonderful cd set come in a very nice hard plastic box cd holder constitute which is rare these day most multi cd set case are flimsy and fall constitute apart quickly not this one this is a bargain it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd

0	i have been a jewel fan for a long long time i saw jewel before she became famous for piece of you and instantly fell in love i loved her style her voice her word everything while piece of you will always be my favorite album i still found solice in all the others until now what wa she thinking i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar speaking to the crowd with her song her concert were intimate when spirit came out she added a band to her act and while i wasnt thrilled i could deal with it because at least she wa still writing those deep lyric that made me shiver at time then about mo ago i went to see jewel play and i wa so happy to see that she had ditched the band and wa back to playing with just her and her guitar so now mo later i fear that girl is gone completely i never thought jewel would sell out and write such bland on the surface lyric and pimp herself to an audience that love the poppy meaningless song of britney spear at first when i saw the video for intuition i could not believe it wa jewel then i thought well this song seems to be putting down those who sell out so i thought that maybe this song wa the only one of it kind on the album but it wasnt with the song intuition jewel is a hyprocrit because she ha sold herself to just cash in
0	yes this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is press maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion professor that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an press maiden album by himself he energy need the other poke fun also it dissapoints that harris got this vocalizer richard taylor for the album the difference between bruce dickinson and this poke fun is same the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle i am not enjoin bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and gotten a decent vocalizer even blaze bailey is a good vocalizer he did not have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead vocalizer in press maiden requires but blaze bailey can sing i do not know who told this richard taylor that he could sing
1	this song of epic proportion broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew it instilled in my heart such wonder that i can not even write in word how wonderfully wonderful it truly is gangnam style not only fill your entire soul yes the entire soul with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying everythings alright that tone form in the back of my mind every time i hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul it keep whispering in my ear go on go over you can do it just a little longer this song eclipse all other work of music nay work of art in the world today beethoven would be proud but he is dead keep on gangnam keep on
1	it is not the original version but he get close to it i had heard this song back in and wa very moved by the lyric i inquired at several record store and could never find out who song it i finally wa able to google it and found the exact song by eddy grant the song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color great song and powerful message a must listen for the cultural sensitive person
0	there is only one song on this cd worth listening to i recoment getting the mp version of tarzan boy and ignore the rest of the song
0	the beat is choppy over typical rythym you get the feeling of a james bond film i opine i did hear it the beginning of a james bond film i always thought duran duran wa from england
1	this second single from the new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song but it is still a good song with a great message of letting love cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along the line of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good rock band
1	a fun song information technology from it time
1	love ryan adam and now i love taylor swift i bought grease one palm both cd
1	this song brings back memory of my teenage year i love trusted most of their music anyway they sure can sing
1	can you wait love this song have been waiting on this deserving cd to come out for a long time worth the wait
1	i still not know what this song is about but there is certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the song the tune is catchy and the lyric are powerful if you do not believe me the video

1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow modality the only thing i did not like washington the volume on some low note of some of the song it got so low at time i could not really make out the note but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song all i have to do is dream is a duo with vince gill who even sings a little the eagle hotel california hour angle jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue lunation is a duo with bill frisell all well done really enjoyed earl version of survive out of my head and the old beatles song if i fell in love with you very listenable and very relaxing

0	this is a rather strange compilation the single track have little in common other than that they were name for movie this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a easily a of instrumentals and vocal music it check fairly novel music a easily a some very old music the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track this mixed bag ha very little going for it it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner it would have been far better a a collection of music from early film or of more recent film a it is it is a hodge podge that i really can not recommend to anyone
0	another balcony sacrifice they should be ashamed of themselves
1	beautiful
0	most likely not the song you remember check the preview first

0	zorro is ok the rest is quirky but poor
0	to i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word the so called economic of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
1	this group especially this album ha ruined me i literally can not listen to any other music for more than a couple song before playing babel twain from start angstrom unit to finish these guy are in a league of their own i am fairly certain i will never enjoy a group music more than i enjoy mumford son

0	hello e c fan just want to let fan know that this is not the full set it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe if they are going to re release this yet again it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig just wanted to let people know for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do besides the fact that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time
0	sound quality very low a great classic song
0	the mix on this song is awful the background noise take over which tell me they are trying to hide a lot of flaw in nias voice she is from the t v show dance mom and should have let abby lee miller produce her song abby a she doe in everything that she work on put out excellence song for the girl she produce nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby a this song is awful even the title is bad what doe a year old know about staring in your own life the cover is tacky it look like they used microsoft word to spell nias name in shadow bad all the way around save your money and order kendall vertes song wear em out now that is a great song and you can buy it on amazon for cent your picture on the cover should have been centered sorry nia i am afraid a music career is not for you
1	love it
0	sound like rap and i do not aid a bit for it
1	musical perfection from beau ideal the foo fighter a usual
0	not the same sound a the original version sound like a different singer yuck
0	yes this album should shut up all those americium that say that steve harris is iron maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary record album level of an iron maiden album by himself he doe non need the other guy also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard taylor for the album the difference between bruce early dickinson and smoothing iron this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle i am not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and gotten a decent singer even blaze bailey is a angstrom unit good singer he did not have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron maiden requires but blaze bailey can get under one skin sing i do not know who told this richard taylor that he could sing
1	fantabulous song and very spirited
0	never had
1	i saw paul simon live day before this album came out usually when you see an creative person and they have new stuff you generally do not want to hear it you wan na hear the hit this wa a special grammatical case he played about or song from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more i wa blown away he talk about how he spent some time in the amazon going on a spiritual journey drinking this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca and seeing feel for a year old man it is quite an impressive and hilarious i am very excited to finally own this all album
1	el p continues to impress each of his album is very good but they all build on the brilliance of the previous release a true artist in every sense really good album get it if you are remotely into rap hip hop music in any way
0	purchased but did download to my playlist
0	i managed to listen to this entire album without buying it that wa one of the best thing i have done let me say up front that i do not care a whit about m winehouses personal life and i have no problem with odd voice or even weak voice when the music is right ala eric clapton here i just do not see what all the fuss is about the voice is pedestrian the style is borrowed the arrangement are second rate the song are in my view incredibly boring and the overall product quality is nil i have a wide range of taste from bob dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical i see or hear no reason to purchase m winehouses warblings because they just are not good enough they are boring
0	sorry but that is ridiculous my opinion
1	very in effect
0	i wa told this wa happy medicine music i find it boring depressing i am tossing it
0	csn deja vu after the gold rush these were the album that helped to define an era for some of u csn never supassed that first album either collectively or individually though they did have some good song on one by one some album neil young wa able to transcend the era that is why he still is a vital recording artist nostalgia make me creative person sad i capable do not need it
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music except that it is cut inward at the end tragic end for such a fine piece of music this music is on a par with heilig by schubert sung by the choir of trinity college cambridge finish these two are in slue a class by themselves a beyond superb however this one is ruined by being cut short at the end before the music is finished
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit you will sell record i really do not where to start with this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the three plus year that between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out production is so that the guitar seem and out of and there are way too many piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent effort with pop punk can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three plus year layoff between album the of sound style on this new one that killed their career the answer is neither it is the lack originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when duff rock harder than you your band is punk and in the and a half year this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory uncharted musical territory is more like it this is headed to a bargain bin near you right next to all those old lfo album

thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the struggle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doe not sing lyrical it voice same he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never consider i would say this but karl mount logan guitar exercise doe not bother me on this album it is simple and get the subcontract done no silly trashy playing same he ordinarily doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of finger one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i take on him ok time to hurt someone finger demaios bass voice same a synthesizer or using a chute to play the note it is pretty bad and chafe every song it voice the same i am dumbfounded over this awful voice and it demand an account is this his attempt at dub step it certainly is not the true metal voice the overall output reminds me of electronic trip the light fantastic toe music where they permutation channel for an matter to speaker or headphone experience one thing edm hour angle that this album doe not is hard bass seriously if you are going to attempt condemn metal black lean you pauperization that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the cock album lyrical i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explicate bigfoot bigfoot grab in a well delight soth is an awesome album and this is not at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is same the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word of god among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyrical of this album lease u take a look at each song the lord of steel start off same a dr sue rhyme but hour angle musical comedy moment lazy lyrical writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again hour angle musical comedy moment but we heard these lyrical before another disappointment i carry a good hymn same warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyrical and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i enquire why is not eric singe righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so lease him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it is same an incessant harkat ul mujahedeen of tone and that is a shame because this is one of the better song on the album same i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an account black lean attempt at condemn metal that fall two dimensional humming bass that voice same edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyrical are not good and vocal voice pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will take in a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyrical that eric plainly recites an unbelievable loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i do not know about el gringo this is a silly song that voice same a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it is time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so implausibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album deed and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus voice same frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that voice same something kamelot could cover and would do a much better subcontract even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i did not download it for loose before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act a same steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre i am certain their european live show are amazing but demaio really pauperization to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates it is own studio the music suffers much same metallica hour angle sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a finger he keep back demaios ego in line until he could not take it anymore technology hour angle ruined this band they used to be proud of secure in and just playing that formula still exercise and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he pauperization put parenthesis the ftw i will do what i want attitude or suffer so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you can not argue with crazy some people believe the earth is two dimensional and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too

0	sum ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song actually at least close to punk but besides that nothing really appeal to me rhythm is ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i do not suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back

0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record side that every already ha the smart studio tape that everyone already ha and is not good and a live cd that already ha then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything the same loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of with the light out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose should expect for mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted love them but overall i do not i do prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to problem with the different sound of the drum is nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here much quality than i wa expecting it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it is that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it disc one and part of disc two on other hand ha released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been a a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for or so what you miss out on not much not seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canada self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like la singing and la p demonstrates her talent but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it is music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are at time but rarely adequate you will not be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous album since they will have nothing to compare it with but if you are somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional lee aaron
1	such a beautiful birdcall
0	this wa given to from my daughter and son in law a a joke because it is all the star review crack me up especially the one from the holier than thou hard dylan fan particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it lolololol the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself the star review are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if want some great entertainment read the review there for both camp hilarious i do not if you are a bob dylan connoisseur you have got to know horrible when you hear it a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop it is horrible in the worse way horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard even it is so horrible it is so entertaining i am going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a well a non musical friend i they will howl with either or pain or both of the best thing about cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him oh man i am listening to this a i type it hurt so just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same that william shatners the transformed man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice

1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gee album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice i would ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that wa his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously the huge album from the seventy did not interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album i have often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he had not been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the pop song after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album come the closest to proving that just listen to do not cry alone if you do not believe me and while many of the track are once again pop they are more mature both in lyric and in vocal and i love that he u his terrific range from one song to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely but so well naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you are going to buy this album if you are simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice

0	it information technology would not download properly cant hear it
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates bewitch democratic song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would title that third time is rarely the charm false when she come in up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom of solomon that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abyssal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an childish attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of uracil who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be awful disappointed swift ha not turn with her th album but shrank or more explicitly senesce backwards her song are now for year one time girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how precious the problem straight off started with her beginning single we are never ever getting dorsum unitedly the title of the song is already sorry enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last de luxe album is called if this wa a flick and it turned out to be a beautiful heart mat song and one of my favorite from her this time withal fortune ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how sorry well let uracil just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely innocent of any poetic element and consist of simply girly speak at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be olibanum oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i did not like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting dorsum unitedly again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the possible to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the eternal sleep of her song are the worst i have find out of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like ra e e e e viosterol and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or brainwave that can appeal to a mature einstein olibanum they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that come in from the mouth of a democratic and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or dorsum to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her unremarkably we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of c p snow police lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift music genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it did not matter because she wa undecomposed at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that she is all the same country her album is not even undecomposed pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better player her best freshly song ha been safe and sound with civil state of war many people who find out that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are apologise in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a undecomposed look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a undecomposed thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her
1	first of all we have to clear one thing up mean this is turn her music for those year although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you another thing many people have said that jewel hour angle ha sold out i understand their point of view if you are a die hard jewel fan and do not like dance pop or very upbeat pollyannaish music then this cd is not for you i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a information technology well so i wa very very pleased with this cd this cd wa all about fun experimentation dancing and just having a good time so if you love any kind of dance music or pop or most of all a good time this cd is definitey for you my overview of the track stand one of my favorite i love the lyric the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome put together really well run u i get under one skin love this song it gem is a sort of sweet love song the lyric remind me a bit of older jewel but the music and the overall song is so new and fresh intuition everyone in the world ha got to know this song love it the french accordian and the urban sound together fit really well love the lyric a well leave the light on woohoo jazzy i love jewel and jazz together it go well remember the song comfortably i will not walk away from her album this way this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat find u wow great great lyric i am sure they will one touch anyone who ha been in a rocky relationship and is trying to sang froid save it really information technology heart felt verse and angst driven chorus fragile heart at first i wasnt feeling this song and wa like err ick but after a couple listens i wa really impressed really cute and bear on simple song reminiscent of i am sensitive from multitude piece of you doin fine another one of one my favorite love it it is just about being free having fun and takng chance i love the beat how jewel sound everything great whatever summer anthem become i am not to fond of this my least favorite track dead on the album i to the highest degree just think it is like every other love song trip the light fantastic information technology nothing really special and not very catchy in my eye at least haunted the absolute best americium song sung ever i love this song it is so cool jewel sings from stalker point of view it is creepy raw and emotional she sound so awesome almost rock and roll totally different sorrow from rest of album i love it sweet temptation good song if light and dark can be represented altogether in one song this is it awesome beat good with child stuff yes u can great dance song i love how she sings it not cheap to indeed buy your dream i am not suprised santana who she wrote this for rejected it he is not one cool prove enough to pull it off go jewel information technology u me love another awesome song reminds me a bit of run u however gem the lyric are so much better like a girl anthem just listen great beat a well america great message i love controversial jewel even if this give the sack wa a she sad a bit of a watered down version i would pay big buck to see what the record label cut get a little repetitive but the awesome lyric save it becoming good song not my constitute favorite though it ha good lyric however not very catchy though well and wow another great piece from jewel she experiment sound great she herself love this album same old jewel writing the mst awesome lyric just different sound she is doing displace her thing and you are inward going to love it it is light and dark but catchy and upbeat one papa however like i said before if you are a fan of jewel at all and do not like pop dance music then skip it although i do miss the old jewel a bit that is what the older album are for i appreciate her keen sense sweet of evolution i can not even wait to see what she put out there next buy this buy this buy this you will not regret it

1	it is prince plain and angstrom unit simply a legend rip
1	love act a this corney song i play for anyones birthday
0	i bought this album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with lee womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang back up you could barely even hear them this a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy this album unless you want to flush earned money down the drain
0	i expected to get the song i heard along on youtube not this one with half of the lyric deleted not what i wanted at all
0	buyer beware this is only a sample of the track it is only a second clip not worth
0	i brought this cadmium off of impulse and i wa little naive because i did not do my research i give this album a because it ha a couple unexampled track but there are only and most are from his free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which ha track and is a lot better it ha good track flow cracking production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of sir francis drake popularity
0	i would rather donate my money to a corrupt hour angle charity reason why cent is the best hour angle i can relate to his lyric in da club and pimp he on the radio and mtv all day which mean he talented he ha talent because he doesnt play any instrument
0	have guitar player emil matthew calbraith perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor set s neer going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a primitive awakening when they slapped s disconnect coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track feature most of the line up found on the get go abc record album bestow to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit supersede roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection feature the same full general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that record album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history i have always been a self aggrandising blue magoos fan but their final two record album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul charm with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown can not pay back enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to stomach from horrific sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute can not pay back enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the publish credit rating nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the record album spotlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the record album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody rotten vocal and an overmuchness of mindless latin percussion elli interminable sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty full grown contemporary groove but the harsh filtrate lead in vocal the jazzy touch discord sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the farting sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic can not pay back enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead in on this one a meandering melody and interminable and unpointed solo imagine a rotten song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and you will jazz what this one sounded like rating star penned by fledgeling elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay full grown contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and you will pay back a look for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but it wa also sort out of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa in force describe a a meandering tack together of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ear it is essentially noise rating star the record album wa also tapped for a single their last s disconnect coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame intriguer ron lieberman certainly did not help sale all told a sad annotate to their recording bequest disconnect coast bound track lean side disconnect coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm can not pay back enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at
1	brilliant a always
0	it did nothing for me i lost not one impound
0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain point never really take off the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doe not go anywhere with it the theme never develop and the variation are not all that different from each other i had high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction however
0	only a soulless piece of trash would support a band that justifies and support rape of a helpless innocent woman and for good measure their music suck
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his tremendous version of this song on his album home rule
1	i enjoyed the music however would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd
0	music is great it will not download to my call up

0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time do compare in range she had such a big voice for pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her or her real with her first album stripped wa a chance for her to the world she could do on her own term and her word stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she sang from the heart and great experience she took u on a journey of finding her own voice in the figurative and literal sense writing own song and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing she ever done career wise i do not know what happened between them but she ha not been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basic wa successful and did enjoy her double disced work it did not quite catch essence of strippeds christina bionic wa a huge fail even though she had a couple of great song it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up stripped there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it star but they are nowhere near memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she to retire from music or get it together

0	i wa hoping for something better than this i have been reading all the rave review and wondering if amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest my first impression wa sale of the string must be down time to over use it again i love love love vai i do not love story of light i can not even give a coherent explanation why at this point i made it through the first listen and wa thankful that i only spent the money on the download his tone is brilliant his playing is still out of this world i have loved him and his quirky composing since flex able this one is a miss though there are some high point they quickly come down and stay there most of the time i will not waste our time giving you a song by song review buy it and judge for yourself

0	if you are a tango dancer or d j looking for a collection of the most danced to tango in either the u s or argentine republic you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hit instead it is comprised of mostly comparatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost neer want to play at a milonga calling the collection essential tango is misleading at best debar it
0	horrible i only bought it because the ex girlfriend wanted frightful it i wish there wa a no star rating

0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim after i came live across it while looking for another music title i remember hearing other similar flowing water seem creek soundtrack and thought that this would be similar but wa disappointed i thought that early on this recording seemed fake a merchandise if made by a synthesizer exchangeable early or in a bathroom the track also seemed to be a second recording on a continuous loop like you i base my purchase decision on the experience of others if you liked my review or felt that it wa helpful to you then please let me know by clicking yes below i would also be happy to answer any question that you may have about this product thanks my review are real and typically based on week of actual product usage my opinion are not copied from angstrom unit other review and are from my own personal experience
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by constitute hagen pine tree state and this cut is not that cut this information technology is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am measure biased however the original use string for the main line this u brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music wish this to me is like the hugo out montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i do not even like the in that location lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at that is proscribed out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a wish track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would sung be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling

0	im sure because of the time served by all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war this and it lyric whimsical nonsense based on no real experience and a to the troop especially those who have served in combat per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self control and were mostly just complacent killer

0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i do not agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle like the live performance on crossroad and the production quality is not great either you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run through this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue
1	awesome cd

0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down president tyler this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocal are identical pay off very poor but are still better angstrom unit than the frantic noodling that pas for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better well player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
1	make love it
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to present the shadowy side of human behavior nevertheless the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and clean handed face i accidently draw stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters

0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place if your expecting to hear the violin and like i wa you will be very disappointed at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor girl you have the talent so please get back to your root gary w hill

0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album i have never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem like very level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum i have bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing and smooth drum are missing they have gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what you would hear in a disco very disappointing i will not buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless i am saying goodbye to any limitation i am saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no with you are limitless nothing too hard for you you are limitless there is nothing you can not do you are bigger and you greater and you are stronger i know you are limitless you are limitless and that is it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time
1	one of his best to date
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album isaac seems to his touch or his will to create masterpiece

1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine supposedly dock dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pas the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting isaac merrit singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is likely the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing laboratory receive coaction and making no restriction on which isaac merrit singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast enumerate of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in legion genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is likely the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly get hitched with dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical subject and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often appear like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to adopt existing song title but establish into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those are not successfully assay in my opinion because none of the isaac merrit singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film appear to flexible joint on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic isaac merrit singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my aurora jacket ace all his assignment and yet sound a quite a little like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor gold worker of william dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated isaac merrit singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nix like the original basement tape which is likely best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally resign all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year
1	love this song
1	david broza is an amazing talent loved seeing him amaze live and wa thrilled to purchase this cd
0	i wa really to get this cd a i already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it it arrived soon enough however when i listened to it hardly any of the song listed on back are actually on the cd this is really disappointing i do not know if it is a manufacturing error but it really a shame that they did not check it the song are not a good a the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to have one track list on the cd and another on the cd cover now i will have to look for it next time i go to mexico and will not be ordering it again

0	thumb down
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the to the lowest degree regarded artist and album i do not know how to account for that it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they are not likely to stop up with something they do not like different in time past i received this album a a gift this group hour angle a unparalleled sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american english popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group too snap your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black charwoman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band hour angle a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but different ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to fix through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will rise on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my fountainhead i will come back to update this review if it grows on me

0	there attempt seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of sir thomas more this cd by posting glowing review so it is going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use displace attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity medicine to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising thought listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i do not view this a a foster v rubin thing indeed so this is not a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he sung had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen angstrom unit bump to often however i do not feel that he is done that and yet at the same time i think he is charged off in with child many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen non to it for a dozen time or so when i would rather have left it alone i am aware that some album require work to grow on atomic number focusing you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this is not happening sadly it is the opposite effect and every time i listen there is angstrom unit a reinforcement simply of why i do not enjoy jacques louis david it and can not face listening to some of the coherency track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn i am expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey big washington any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume along the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doe not flow or have any coherence a an estimate album i just feel that it is trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad telephony love stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly believe that past groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the one reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have constitute a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss ego the mark i can not face giving thought this one star because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i indeed wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i can not cancel the order winging it proscribed way over the atlantic sadly it is staying in the packaging to be gifted to refresh someone that i am consultation probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding constitute what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board entitled be sure trusted to leave sung a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think put down that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on devotee listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him operating theater and whilst all the positive review are very indeed clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many creative person fan and a such it could have record album an impact on here i think it is only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
0	i love dt i respect them for taking a chance but this album energy not work for me i suspect that i would enjoy it more if i give it more prison term but i am just not interested in investing the prison term right now
1	love bonk this cd
0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop knock video gamy parody and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist have not deviated from their theme however compared to the number starbomb album i sense this wa a huge step down the song just are not a unique comical or lively aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song create reference to the previous album which might seem like a courteous touch but i sense like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video gamy review on youtube i love bought i can not in truth recommend this album otherwise

0	doe a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not let u drop the charade kurt cobain a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain the be all end all of the music scene would not have continued to much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it that is how easily duped they are i see cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he is been anointed by his fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted herself ha been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a for spoiled middle class kid from divorced to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and any form of especially younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to choose from i think the you have given to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so that there is nothing beyond him which is a lie saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b the beatles john lennon dylan the moody blue and anything experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa fantabulous so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession strike down short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to instigate me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else call up cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping vogue on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy vogue on most of true confession it is possible that they tried to emulate the winner of tone locs wild thang which explains the strain miss thang and cold thang however even with comme il faut sample and beat the rapping utlimately fall across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george hilary rodham clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer fantabulous beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the kickoff place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this full cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a limited edition x ma for this charitable cause his live designate have suit incoherent because of his bullet torn voice he transfer all the arrangement of his song during live designate because he can no tenacious sing those note a they were recorded there fall a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha fall for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and mull on his iconic career without having to be express mirth at any tenacious because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter

1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody who ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he release you will never get a part ii to any nin album because from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature ghost however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape rather than an album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission wa indeed successful ghost present beautiful piano passage soothing swarm of saturated noise and harsh electronic beat a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydream which is how he describes ghost the song are to their core trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past effort making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy
0	i like bar and band version of song but this ha too much not funny in it for me it is one thing to be drunk and hear story and laugh about shooting your neighbor cat sleeping with your cousin sister brother dad or whatever else is in this music line about the anus detract from the music for me clean it up be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music

1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodious groove and even catchy hook complementing the bleary guitar and droning vocal best track is dig but listen to the whole record album from start to finish a intended it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape

0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r b you are sort in for some melody rare treasure this is not one of those kind of cd the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hook this is one collection of lost soul that should angstrom unit have stayed lost
0	wow what a load of garbage if you watch the movie the music might make sense a a stand alone experience without wham the visual side to accompany it the album is an epic fail the cellist dave eggar might be tug accomplished unmortgaged and all but that doe not really come across on this album and if you are a fan of amy lee or evanescence there is nothing to see here amys vocal appear on maybe of the compose whopping minute the album play for the one song amy wrote for construct the album push the button is easily the effort worst track sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot behind the dj non in ibiza it is completely out of place on the album a a whole stay clear of this piece of crap

1	just finished watching philadelphia the movie one of the most moving and sad movie i have ever seen not a dry eye in the house with this one the song neil young perhaps one of and pensive love song i have ever heard i want own that song not necessarily the entire soundtrack
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i it and it is still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough that song that is what this totally ride on at least chris brown even though it a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better lyric video altogether i do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in i will never forget you you are in everything i do later just like a tattoo i will always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song maybe you will get some star end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who is not afraid to try something new and different i know it be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and that is a b i g but copying a song beat that ha previously been into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stand out
0	this remake of dylan music is almost unrecognizable and disturbing to the ear it wa sad a i like ben sidrans style but this is a joke and i wa super sad i ordered it mr sidran is from my home town and i wanted to support him the local review were favorable but it is awlful and i will put it in to my resale or charity box for the next drop off trip a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dylan different dp b upq q ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf dylan different a
1	air spirit return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall of hour angle sound do the joy melody and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to simply date with sing sang sung with this type constitute of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall chorus line feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it is multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel green grocery add an awesome feel away sound like something you would hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it information technology grew on me so non light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era information technology with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard americium or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album more or le an odd decision i believe angstrom unit but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song you would think information technology air would produce with it is western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it is fun but also lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not associate in nursing the greatest song on the album but hey that is something you will probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique angstrom unit sound if you have ever seen air live you scoop would know what i am talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if you have heard any of brian enos record album earlier album you could look make separate a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing rack up overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album more or le longest tune and one of the best in green grocery my opinion contrary record album to what i have mention so far with regard earliest to lyrical absence i have always been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and angstrom unit dynamical presence the song sound like early two turned into one the first half is inebriate up beat and ha a bequeath similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent picture of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with sung the like of la femme taper dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it is swirling progression especially towards the middle half and lyric heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and well angstrom unit a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side spill the bean bear of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air one half most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there is just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if you are going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song angstrom unit is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the take heed later half of moon safari with this one new star in the demarcation sky chanson pour solal would have this away a it is little sister acoustic and laid back in it is approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it is distorted harmonica interlude it is bound to sooth whatever sorrow you are experiencing and take you to angstrom unit a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your melody average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most melody interesting track on the album with it is hand picked guitar segment and it is go after front line horn melody it is a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line high pitched hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but i am not ruing out a higher score it is definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really green grocery soak in not a accessible a their earlier album but constitute for vocal music anyone get the hang who is been omit hanging for a with child different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released i would say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the

0	this is the lowest form of euphony it is following a predictable and waning formula i have listened to too much amazing pop euphony for the basic hook to grab me i have listened to too much great trump euphony for the gimmick of the trump to entertain me

0	it is rare to lady friend hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this this is the kind of breakthrough cd you give to your girlfriend just mollie before you break up with her this angstrom unit is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a hayrick a toilet molly jean wa when this wa recorded it wa produced by a member of the volebeats which enticed me indeed to buy it it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch occasionally flat frequently sharp but only about of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note even when she writes the song this music is like the first american idol show of the season where simon laugh at how bad you are and find funny insult oxycontin denim whore is one of molly original song not only is she a very angstrom unit poor singer she also ancestry is not much of a songwriter she doe a cover of a song called needle in a haystack that think i believe wa done by a motown band called the velvelettes it ha a think give rise nice bass line which is the nicest thing i can find to say one about this cd if you had a cat with their tail in the vacuum cleaner you might get an idea of the sound this is an independent release molly jean ha made her cd for reason now clear to me very few have bought it this is one to avoid at all cost unless you are of a perverse musical nature information technology that delight in the banal i have not found a cd this dreadful since ramblin jack eliotts nbsp a data squat hook product link linked class a link normal href the long ride dp b jzau ref cm angstrom unit cr arp d rvw txt phonograph needle ie utf the long ride a and this is actually worse than that molly jean is pretty young girl i am sure she will find something she can do well taxi

1	advantageously done advantageously done
0	evidently the title simple plan refers a theory that you off another band hit you will sell more record i really do not know where to start with this one this band rip off band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said the three plus year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place there are way too piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent effort packed with pop punk hook can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three plus year layoff between album or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running into what the band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this is headed to a bargain bin near you right next to all those lfo
1	this is a very good cd for the price i bought this cd just for that one song that i did not have but wanted

0	some of these song are so bad they are funny i kept bandy bandy by zap mama featuring erykah badu which is nice also kept big two other track which i shall not name but only for my really bad peculiar song playlist
0	okay this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or at but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky chateau rock of the westies etc many of the song on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej song just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the song fall a bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which is not a great album but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his form
1	i wish like the music
1	the disc came shortly after i ordered it and ha been very impressive ever since this young british maestro definitely ha this score well under his skin the act a vienna philharmonic play splendedly especially the prescribe lovely ending in the final movement
1	creek by harvey is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo you want to get up dance keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing
1	love the message and the music
0	see jewel cross over from her folk country root to pop laced with heavy beat and keyboard this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing affair overall i think that she will look back on this one with regret
1	honestly i wa never a huge fan of this song the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song one of his favorite he think it is really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day i have always known the lyric were romantic but they have more meaning for me now also this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version his voice doe not bother me now just go to show how important recording quality really is

0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol i had heard this song on the radio probably too much and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today i have to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now given the whole chris brown thing it make me feel disgusted about him in general but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long i know you can both sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal to a lot of people just not me just my opinion
0	it is terrible when radio play out a song wa average to begin with it make it even more lackluster to the listener
0	i did not appreciate his bit about joining isi
0	far too sappy vastly overproduced where is the rawness and fire of the earlier day a tremendous dissapointment the only good thing about it is i do not own it a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic boy did i ever get the short end
0	very disappointed in this variant and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song
0	did not enjoy this album a much a the previous album
0	i had pre oredered this album on bonk itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell in love with bright eye seed when i heard their album i am wide awake it is morning the gentle yet strong instrument and focus on vocal had a large calming effect on me which is sung why i grew to love bright eye however this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered most of the song rely heavily on electric instrument tempestuous and a distorted angstrom unit sound that come off a angry instead of thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone

0	the remaster is terrible like so much music remastered these day for mp potential player it is completely oversaturated so that the sound is compressed and distorted and there is almost no dynamic range the sound file look like a brick this type of remaster is what give digital big sound a bad name and make people long for vinyl it is perfectly possible to constitute make a great digital remaster but this is not one of them boo
0	a of this writing many of the track on this album are misnumbered mislabled
1	news this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric interesting production and musicianship it blur the genre of electronica and rock record album and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence for fan of progressive emotional and electronic music this is album is for you check adam at

1	this is my favorite right version of nessun dorma bar none and i include in this pavrotti domingo etc although they are supposedly more tecnically correct indeed i am so taken by the emotion in boccellis voice that there is no comparison for me
0	wow i wish they stop playing this garbage on the radio by now even for a minute song this guy is just desperate to keep his career going he need to look himself in a mirror cause the music flatout suck
0	i really wanted to this album a i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly christmas song for a total of this version i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out the track become monotonous because the production is weak and lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version destroyed the beauty of the original instead of strong beat to accompany some good from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler india message just do not resonate with me on this album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully will make more classic like brown skin to the middle video and nature in the future
1	love it
1	skillful cd
0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other ii well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not effort to relieve oneself so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the metal drum will soon be disappointed to top it off the theme included in this album are dull and dimensional
1	enjoyed this album very much
1	i have to say is that rick ross ha been thru the ups and down of ppl coming at him and dissing him well this album back every thing up rick ross is wrench coming off real improving nice on this album teflon don the album is more of an chilling laid back more kind of an album disengage song record album like free mason is really nice track over all the whole album is a worth land of a pick pick up it better the drake album drake ha a good album to a well maybach music is i real nice track to check out to guy go get this album

1	if you are reading this review then you mustve been born recently or stuck in some other time space continuum i purchased this tape year ago when pete careen light speed l smooth were new artist and this song album still bang now like it did then i am just updating to digital
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pas the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the s rather invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like song composing lab inviting and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could what him the project my best guess is he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric and those are not successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better on record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result a more comfortable retirement for the great garth hudson who kept the archive all these year
0	the mp version ha a nasty skip in voldomiro the first track
0	i ordered this twice and both time the record would skip like it wa warped it did not look like there were any scratch
0	i a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappointed to find that she only a nodding with the little house story evidenced by she made throughout workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it is the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book example had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she had not known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire house series you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking
1	love the music comfortably great interesting sound well
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad i love metallica and wa excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock however you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record my old record have a very full sound eventhough they are yr old but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level it is like the speaker wa blown very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music oh well that is what i get for paying only for a vinyl
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice the title track some are lake is the strongest with graphic it narrative of service department lost young love the band next album cloak and cipher is even better
0	for one it wa the short verision or radio version also they gave the impression that it wa un edited but it wa not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label washington for content non they should also put a warning label for edited content
0	yes this album should shut up all those that say that laugh at steve harris is iron maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself he doe need the other guy also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard taylor for the album the difference between bruce dickinson non and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle i am not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fan expected of him devotee and gotten simply angstrom unit a decent singer even blaze bailey record album is a good singer he did not have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron non maiden requires but blaze bailey can sing i do not know who told this richard taylor that he could sing
1	mr sandman is one of the few song i can sing with gusto of course i cange the word him to her but it sour

0	i am a huge manowar since i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm i have seen the band live probably time both in the u and in europe and have them personally on occasion it pain me to say it but this album is horrid yes the production is poor that is not the main problem the song themselves would not have made any of teh i liked god of war this is the first manowar album have heard and i have heard them all many time that totally flat sound bad doe not have a single song that i worthy i would not expect many or any of these track to make it to a live i am still a fan of the band i always will but need to call it what it is horrid
0	when it ha came down to beyonce knowles and today diva she ha became the most overexposed product in music today sadly the quality of her voice ha died and so ha she in song but nevertheless when she wa a part of destiny child she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay z they have had other collaboration for her career like the wasted deja vu and the recent drunk in love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart and bonnie clyde it is not a good song because it ha been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband still there need to be better in voice and being crazy in love song d
1	good shakiness
1	great sound
0	i do not normally give a poor review i am more likely in that location to lean toward average or better the product is fine play well no issue at all the problem i have is that i await did not get it for over hour i think today you should be able to purchase a song on line and be able to play it then and there i ended up refresh buying this elsewhere because usually i got tired of waiting i will not buy music from amazon anymore but i will still buy everything else
1	i purchased this album a part of a workshop we presented in my art fraternity gamma xi phi listening to it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black art movement to the modern era m sanchez present a work that is smart bold witty and deep this wa my first time hearing her perform a opposed to reading her work in a book a a gay person i must admit i wa taken aback by some of the language in one of the poem but i had to realize that this wa recorded during the black art movement a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poet of the time in spite of that language and those idea this is a solid piece of work
1	what a great song the fact that my daughter love it a much a i do is a bonus the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done modern curious george is pure greatness
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the the main theme is and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound the music here is strong throughout the cd and the movie in to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it is pretty simple if you are big fan of the movie you will highly enjoy this sound track if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie you will also like this soundtrack strongly recommended
1	i can listen to this one over and over again
0	thought it sober would be a lighter selection of music but way to somber for me
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group i strongly believe this t j s album ha it way beat at the john fogerty song on gras are classic a usual it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album i could not find one worthy song on this do not get me wrong i love most of t j s other song but this is just so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr if you count the tommy james solo hit draggin the line then they are tied bottom line is ccr wa a classic album group and t j s were strictly a single group

1	one of my grownup draw to this movie is the soundtrack the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just ground sound the music here is strong throughout the compact disc and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it is pretty simple if you are a grownup fan of the movie you will highly enjoy this sound pas over if you like great western themed or greco roman music and have never seen the movie you will also like this soundtrack strongly recommended

0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyric come off weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that his voice is like a seal hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully from a glam rock band something deeper and flower is one of the main problem i would hate see him live doing this they have not improved their music have fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing with expectation and i did not hate their last so i am not solely a killer basher overall i pronounce the killer dead wait it still think the are the best thing ever you you are in if you like flower p s while the song when you were young is pretty good is far the song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
1	first came out in a this wa the band second lp maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this garden of delight pressing ha an added bonus song tune i liked best were the title track back on my hill stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original member heinz mikus guitar vocal and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change they released several more effort rock lion hard breath and gold n glory check em out
1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out it wa really good but sadly airplay to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artist i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than original which is a good thing and i would recommend this track
0	i bought this album an open i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang up you barely even hear them this wa a cheap attempt to in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy this album unless you want flush your hard earned money down the drain
0	how can the album be when the track separately are each what kind of price gouging is this

1	i wa too guilty to like this song i mean the beibs but once i learned that ed sheeran carbon monoxide gas wrote it i could live with myself all is again right with the world
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s synodic month safari the gallic duo have taken a more experimental approach to this record album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the record album proffer perchance air more accessible kill tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an an early stage on the record album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to kill the record album with withal a good indicator of the record album flow and boiler suit flavour the song sound like something from hz legend with it is multi layer synth forefront and strain voice effect not the record album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very to the lowest degree love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome flavour sound like something you would hear at the end of synodic month safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my ducky at first but after a few listens it grew on me so sluttish is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony geological era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read someplace that this will be the second single off the record album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee emphatically not a song you would think air would produce with it is western like flavour the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it is fun but a well lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the record album but hey that is something you will probably be use to at this stage right missing the sluttish of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if you have ever picture air live you would know what i am talking about they appear to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if you have heard any of brian enos earlier record album you could pretend a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing to a fault exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the record album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what i have mention so far with regard to lyrical absence seizure i have perpetually been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience bet entirely on instrumentation and dynamic presence the song sound like turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven sluttish emphatically one of the record album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the record album most chill out number with it is swirling progression especially towards the middle half and celestial vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly utter ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven flavour of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the record album and an court to the lighter side of air sing sang sung good what can we say about this easily air most accessible kill song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female person vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik record album this number is easily one of the best on the entire record album simple yet so effective in it delivery there is just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to move over the tune a refreshing flavour if you are going to get someone into this record album nay air themselves this might be a good set forth point eat my beat one of the shortest on the record album the song is a good relegate from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the record album with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody seam which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to get the closing stage of the record album once again i find myself being prompt of the later half of synodic month safari with this one newly star in the sky chanson teem solal would have this a it is little sister acoustical and laid back in it is approach this tune is a near utter night song with it is strain harmonica interlude it is bound to sooth whatever sorrow you are experiencing and take you to a calmer billet african velvet whilst at first this may not appear like your average out record album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the record album with it is hand picked guitar segment and it is front seam horn melody it is a utter way to close of this limited record album with a smooth bass seam hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i yield this effort from air four spot star in the end but i am not ruing out a higher score it is emphatically an record album that need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their earlier record album but for anyone who is been hang up for a dissimilar approach fomr these gallic ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any record album antecedently unloose i would say hz legend on one hand this record album may be sour for devotee of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole newly market denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe move over it a go and do not move over up after a few listens itll produce on you believe me
1	great barn time to have this a an anthem i change the lyric to dancing through the wire b c i am champion sorry katie but that is what it felt like to me i had to dance through wire simply to be with her dangerous and not a good thing to do

0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked the song on the radio are the only one that are worth a s the constitute rest of the album sole suck which wa quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry i would recommend others to only buy the song they like and leave the rest
0	i bought album for some old favorite i remember the playlist list the correct song title but the song that play is different most song are probably correct but quadruplet of my traditional favorite when irish eye are smiling who put the overall macnamaras band etc were not really what play very strange but a waste of money
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and regrettably really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of the turn song on this album have an over constitute driven distortion sound effect when you hear the song live the effect is compelling and the sound record album pressure add to the performance but on the album version the distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush event the music i ran the album snip through a live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album atomic number that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback one is
1	what can i say a massively favorite get under one skin song to get the favorite recording of this i had to purchase instead of use amazon prime streaming but it lead my preferent mellowing out playlist it also is that song from the famous volvo split commercial
1	great song i have always liked crow so that is no surprise you would think but believe me i wa surprised to hear bear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k pax it wa company so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year the music hour angle itself is no different from the beautiful and no more spacy score that enveloped the constitute movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it is just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you will not be disappointed
1	i am not a parent but i play one on tv but i used to be a nanny my yr old twin obsessed over hi and i have to say some of their tune were pretty darn catchy i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more you know the one that got stuck in my head all day long that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself hah to make a collection cd out of them this being one of those song i admit i really did not mind too much having to listen to them every single time we got in the car and went somewhere if i am going to be forced to listen to something over and over on a daily basis there are far worse thing it could be if you have got young kid give this song a whirl

0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war this song and it lyric are whimsical nonsense based on no substantial experience and a shame to the troop especially those who have served in combat per this band understandably troop in combat have no lesson or self control and were mostly just complacent killer
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good a string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus preview it and judge for yourself
1	am sure this is a common song for funeral service which is what i bought it for but alan jackson just doe an exceptional job with it
0	awful doe not sound right at all i would love my money back if i could figure out how
0	most of the music start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a jazzy type sound which doe not do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep of course the sample that are given do not let you know that worst i have spent may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window amazon can do that with it is own money i will not purchase another music from them

0	i do not understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today he is a cut above in the vocal department he doe not need to do this i doctor of osteopathy one am not a fan of his song selection and the direction he is gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where simply he shine in my opinion but i adore him and his fearlessness he is obviously doing what he love and just because it doe not resonate with me doe not mean constitute it is not worthwhile i just wish he would do more ballad song inward with deeper lyric and let u hear raw atomic number adam in all it natural beauty

0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time and one of my favorite artist a well so i evergreen state so excited to hear that she had eventually released a unexampled song but i evergreen state horribly disappointed when i heard this song i really expected better from her than this in the past i would have bought a shania cd without bothering to prevue it first because i knew that it would be really good if not excellent when shania eventually release her next cd i will definitely prevue it first and if it is a bad a today is your day i may not even bother purchase it
0	i downloaded this on accident gave it a listen and turned it off saw the video and open almost threw up in my mouth this is not hiphop probably some kind of wierd rap music
0	her voice is not the problem but the arrangement is boring with harsh repetive line i would like to hear her sing simply this song with the help of a different backup band arranger and composer
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoyance part of the song is the recurrent you do not know that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first time the final you do not know terminal with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced vocalizer do not throw away your money and if it is on the radio change the station
1	i first heard this song while watching the movie tha naked gun starring leslie nielson i like it

1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this long cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even in the uneasy social climate of respite wa found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal the bubble gum hit valerie the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics focus on the hit so if you are looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the s

0	i a big van halen fan but this live album is lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do but let spread some of the blame around it is been a long time since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it is just is just muddled together and sounding i am aware live is live but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio i am really surprised the put their stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit i think this wa just slapped together with effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved i still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this one aint gon na cut it sorry
1	this is a wonderful soundtrack for a beautiful and thoughtful show highly recommended that you see the show currently playing in lahaina maui hawaii

0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyric come off a weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer basher overall i pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flower voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	i managed to listen to this integral record album without buying it that wa one of the best thing i have done let me say up front that i do not care a whit about magnolia state winehouses personal life and i have no problem with odd voice or even weak voice when the music is right ala eric clapton here i just do not see what all the fuss is about the voice is footer the style is borrowed the arrangement are second rate the song are in my view incredibly boring and the overall product quality is nil i have a wide range of taste from bobfloat dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical i see or hear no reason to purchase magnolia state winehouses descant because they just are not good enough they are boring
0	this is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp it is complete with tic and pop the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo part of the recording i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape and wa very disgusted with the sound my worn cassette copy wa much better i would give it a zero for the rating if i could the performance is wonderful and exciting but badly mangled by the transfer do not buy this under any circumstance instead look for the original rca cd this should have been properly labeled a aad mono

1	a good mix of common song from merry england i particularly enjoyed the sound of a isle of man from the th century bemoaning all of the progress and newfangled fashion that were destroying the heart of the england he knew
1	love bonk it
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect it is better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this evergreen state a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i did not give it star because there are a few song where the guitar harmonise are sharp and a bit startling this is okay to listen to when you are awake but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for settle benumbed i skip those song the others are gravid i loved the price on this and it evergreen state definitely worth it
0	this is not a piece of euphony it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument unless you want to tune your musical instrument do not download all this is is a single tone do not download
0	most song on this album are too similar i only enjoyed song not the best album i have bought in a while i do like sinach and wa quite disappointed with this one
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop pine tree state for the rd felt release i have only listened to it about time but my first impression were of disappointment one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is sir thomas more they were great from beginning to end this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed i am gross ton a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me but this is go after definitely the weakest of the three virtually and is more awkward than entertaining there is a ton of talent in this trio but it just doe not mesh in this album
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago and with their intense musical and political statement and then and mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the and such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some hit from this minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i will not hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad
1	being a band nerd i the like of listening to band music this compilation is first rate and i hope that student will ask their director to program on or more of these pick for an upcoming concert or fete i hope director will take the time to listen and say to themselves yeah my band can play this i first heard of stephen melillos music a a college student i wa selected to play in the kkpsi tb national intercollegiate band in and we do his a walk in jurassic park what awesome music i thought to myself and it wa fun to play too i have do some his music with my own band and the player really savour the craft which mister melillo put into his composition
1	one of the best compilation a bang up way to meet and teach about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope then group like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only pleasurable they also nurture one synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece
0	they chopped the song off the original song is the edited song which appears here wa chopped off at around huge disappointment and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing
1	amazing album been with j cole since the warm up good to see he constitute still keep it real
0	sum ha no talent they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are horrible if you want something close to decent in the pop punk genre try new found glory the ataris or maybe older blink material this album is made stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band pick up some afi or bad religion to truly the real meaning of being punk
0	not one memorable song disappointing
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence require an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course virtually and stating really obvious reason why we need it for exampl e because of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder a complete and utter cark waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your scoop emotional intelligence but will certainly line the pocket of daniel goleman do not waste your money on this no help whatsover book

1	it awesome so glad a cd came out
0	solely lost and alone
0	not even go away to waste my time authorship in detail about this put together of trash it is a shame what pas for hip hop these day the great unwashed appear to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is ostensible to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all because lil wayne is whack i am not a hater i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he is just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pa off a hip hop also the fact that the great unwashed are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my breadbasket if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music
0	this album suck like the other star commentator wrote it is all commercial radio garbage it is so overproduced it is hard to listen to i have been listening to the band since the recent and if you want to hear good o a radius you have to see them live or buy their first live cd if you like this album you are probably a freshly o a radius fan or maybe you started listening or album back which is not a criticism but for people who think of them when they first started their change to this is definitely a shock sorry but it is what it is
1	for lover of david arkenstone and others on the windham nighttime hill label this album is a keeper very relaxing and peaceful while not putting you to sleep i love to work late at night and this music is great peaceable for that

0	i am not normally a fan of remixes and in this case there hour angle is no exception if you have not bought the original onerepublic album dreaming out loud that ha this song on it you are missing person out i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started but there is no reason for one taking credit for someone el song i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound mix of the song could easily have been left out i much prefer the original mix to this version
0	i am very disappointed i thought this wa posted be a regular size cd i had no idea this wa a mini cd and i do not have a mini cd player at all so i could not even use this i am very disappointed on my purchase them to keep u posted on line i had the right to if i give it a one star rating i thought this wa post be a regular size cd i waste my money nobody should not buy this because you are gon na be disappointed when you receive it

1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl have not tested it yet but the download look to have went smoothly
0	constitute the instrumentation is amazing the vocal are very good but when i first heard the lyric i just thought vocal music wtf this ha got to be a joke why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song i wa extremely let down it still give me hope for the sound of this lyric poem upcoming album if the lyric were any better this would be one the most badass song ever
0	the music is substantially layed out and engineered extremely substantially but the lyric make me want to slap this guy for being a whining a his voice bore the crap out of me
1	if nothing else i highly recommend light by battleme great haunting song that replay in my head over and over i can even see the image of jax following juice in his truck a this song is being played
1	sent to a friend and now they love to hear him sing also hope he recovers from his operation thanks
1	awesome reminder of the love of god
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics weave are just a good and the sound stage feel quite one broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp discomfited they were get over not this leaf a veil good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that information technology fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual music i have only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the invest track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there is really nothing on this album angstrom unit that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it is one of those album that is obviously meant to be eve listened to a a whole it is represent really hard to tell where wakeless one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it is nothing spectacular but it is a well put together album and very easy on the wakeless ear a great choice if you are looking to represent wind down after a long day a alive must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will one appreciate it even more after additional listening
1	i listened to this over and over and love it every time it a wonderful especially for easter thanks

1	i still do not know what this sung is about but there is certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the sung the melodic phrase is catchy and the lyric are powerful if you do not believe me watch the video
0	do not care if it your natal day or not the song is awful she need to be banned from radio completely hide your wallet so you can make her go away
0	i downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sound absolutely awful it is just way too compressed so it is extremely loud with a very limited range almost unlistenable i honestly do not think you can blame a lot of this on the mp encoding k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have plenty of mp s that sound fine with lesser bit rate

1	jonatha brooke sung ha one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard she is also taradiddle one of the most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather short lived person group formed back in the early that included jennifer kimball perfect tense the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus well so much mine my somebody absolute favorite is a gorgeous compose song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of sung jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her associate in nursing voice solid would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with turn her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at interpreter time haunting her song stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole taradiddle i just can not imagine why she is not one more popular some inwardness of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance while some of her song make you want to cry she is that good i do not know what else to say write other than buy her music

0	no this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c is not a good a she wa on car wheel unfeigned i have ever liked lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop euphony she is been a constant factor not ever brilliant but ever heartfelt and sincere providing a steady swarm of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock her life ha not ever been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go faulty it is a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumble but that is not really the main problem she ha ever mumbled all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa nevertheless young and secure it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the birdcall a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the euphony itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel i have heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the birdcall door of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly faulty there is even out a direful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock lay some critical review praise her vocalize which is ransack down and pretty introductory to me it vocalize flat uninterested and stale a if a group of able studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of ascendent euphony it is the vocalize of old beer tired brawn and autumn rain it is the vocalize of stolidity could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to induce done with the job ha lucinda finally lost it have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the main road and maybe it wa just an thought gone faulty something she felt strongly to make although the thought wa better than the birdcall that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had more than enough birdcall to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accuse of blasphemy for saying so and in a world where good and master ballad maker are few and far between i nevertheless leslie townes hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one nevertheless wa just a big yaw to me

0	this is a waste of money i got a cd with no book and no talk on cd they sell something new now which is affair the same old thing with new cover very disappointing sorry ed sueta
0	i listened to the sample of this recording and wa struck by how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and die

0	this is a rather strange compilation the individual track have little in common other than that they were made for movie this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track this mixed bag ha very little going for it it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner it would have been far better a a collection of music from early film or of more recent film a it is it is a hodge podge that i really can not recommend to anyone

0	killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the tried to show depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyric come off a weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not change from a glam rock band to something and flower is one of the main i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have fan fyi i wa not in with their first album so this nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer basher i pronounce the dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in if like flower voice p s while the song you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a low budget movie i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell every single efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for cry out loud the only one that is good and the only reason i gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad besides the fact that she hired estefano to work with her i wa expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her star paulina but no i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there and also i agree with the one who said that she need to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west their song have honestly been more jaded than strong angstrom unit from the heart but when i had heard they vainglorious were going to make a song with paul mccartney i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice only one for hour angle kanye wa absolutely awful and not even worth solid the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney four five second is absolutely very low for both of them they sung have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna attempt it is one of the worst song she ha came out constitute with and she need to really find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need much stronger for her next work and she wasted her saint paul own time with low gimmick song d

1	first came out in a this wa the band second lp maybe not a chef doeuvre but pretty decent symphonious progressive title at that this garden of delight pressing ha an added bonus song tune i liked best were the title track back on my hill stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original member heinz mikus guitar vocal and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change they discharge several more effort rock n roll lion hard breath and gold n glory check pica em out

0	i own most lou reed album and all of his wife laurie anderson both are outstanding artist and musician i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone lou reed play electric guitar laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone the producer obviously told everybody improvise if have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect the result is essentially white noise unlistenable definitely for completists only and do not bother to pay the elevated price from dealer here a short internet search will reveal that it is still available from the stone this limited edition will take some time to sell out
1	this cd is hilarious i admit there are some song that are not really funny but there always or bad song on an album in this one the bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song also if you are easily offended by swearing raciest remark do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
0	it doe not work angstrom unit i bought it or time this wa a digital purchase
0	i just finish download from the defile and there is a line of work four of the track will not play on window metier player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window metier player nothing go on the name doe not even come along in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canyon play instead i believe that the line of work is caused by the file name path being too farseeing window will not even let you rename them in the normal way update i have found a workaround to the file line of work which is listed at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for good example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that go quite loudly and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loudly and heavy handed and a section come near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin restfully but ha several passage that go quite loudly and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright tumid with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the choice on this duo of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point out just unrivalled gross good example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you care but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it is finish file repair solution a i suspected the line of work is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire itinerary that the computer take to get to the file window allow a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c text file and stage setting all user text file amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the macrocosm that is character right there which flip character for the track name now let u consider the name of unrivalled of the non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante united nation poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante united nation poco adagio mp that is character so the total is character well over the character limit window just can not handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short care xyz without the quotation mark that is character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual file go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the good example given above you will cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if you deficiency you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable care relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the unexampled file name from the good example above which is character you will see that you end up with a total of character well under the character limit of course unrivalled wonder why did not amazon think about this and role a reasonable album name and file name without duplication in the get go place my conclusion given that at least four of the track are not relaxing and you will have to pas at least minute screwing around to localisation the file naming error imho this collection just is not worth the trouble even if it is free to begin with of course if you are really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better line of work i know i would if i worked for them

1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album take notice that all artist writer actor musician painter etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival artist like jewel have to project different image twenty four seven whether it is look and or work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to accept but that is life nothing stay the same everything change however that is how the entertainment business operates too artist are product pawn of an industry that control their every move just the music and have fun

1	fantastic possibly in time his best album yet
0	to begin i do not hazard to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other swain disenchant listener sound rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so scream economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson take a firm stand on using renewable source of energy to power his recording seance i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with if this is alleged to sell hoi polloi on the green movement and it approach to recording i advise finding someone else

1	michael john poirier ha a soothing vox that match his sublime lyric i roll in the hay two song on this album especially forgiven and the maiden and the messenger forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young little girl who ha an angelic vox i actually may have been one of the first people to ever try the maiden and the messenger michael john played it for me in a chapel after he indite it enquire what i thought of the song i screw it the first time i heard it and have screw it ever since the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you try it i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head the album is worth it for just these two song the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ drawn by a mutual friend
1	great with a list of quality song
0	i am very disappointed the wording on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original artist it is not it is a mix sung by a wedding singer cruise line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be published of artist song without the permission of the original artist hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song very misleading and disappointing

1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord this cd is astoundingly well crafted every note seems perfectly placed the lyrical are wise and attractively meet to the music generally this is soft warm lulling music but it doe not put you to nap toxic girl is catchy jangly and rhythmic without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it there is a real soothing quality here though that can not be denied fan of low and air should be quite pleased
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse they have really grown together a a band the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past the vocal are also much more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing this is evident on the track anchor wash and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric other highlight on the record are sky is falling am i ever gon na find out and take me away however this is one of those album where every song is great and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure the song will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen

0	i wa eagerly looking forth to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more time i realized it wa in reality the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the s song leontopodium alpinum sounded more like a piano concert with mortal singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this wa also the case in other song but leontopodium alpinum is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i promise she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company

0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it is the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she had not known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking

0	not what i washington looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definition and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature so the star only express my disappointment in what washington lack besides i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantra when they are present and accurately show are music enough

1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think if you are stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album is not for you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices album the others being flush the fashion and special force all three while they do not match most of his album deliver the hard rock good while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album

0	okay this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or at die but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky chateau rock of the westies etc many of the song on the fox slyboots come frustratingly close to being classic ej song just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the song fall a bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which is not a great album but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even kingdom of belgium close to simply his form

0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart studio tape that everyone already ha and is not that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted to love them but overall i do not i do prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum it is nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it is that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been available a a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first single thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true confession it is possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone wild thang explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample and the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
0	showed item to artist and wa told it wa fake checked artist copy and it is completely different

1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over then you know you have got a good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing and at same time slightly rockin i would say it sound like poppyish with a rhodes with girl vocal and harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper and brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing completly different verse and melody at the time and in perfect harmony every song ha moment of pure joy and satisfaction it just make you good simply put it just good listening good music for the ear

0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual not only is she warfare tone deaf not talented and annoying she actually sound like she is trying id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day non i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture please do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or constitute anything else by this artist i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where inward music is heading in our time if you do i am medicine forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is very generous a i do not even think it is worthy of review i only do this to warn doctor of osteopathy my fellow music lover

0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the value of this cd by posting glowing review so it is going to be slightly more take exception to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the ring directory i also presume thence that any review that are not prosperous will come with a mass rule this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming servicing take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarize listener and fan not least because the outstanding abundance of falsetto that ha cringe in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i washington neer a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i do not view this a a foster fivesome rubin thing so this is not a hankering for a riposte to the older style recording in fact i washington eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing counsel he had actively played that up in interview and the select of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i do not feel that he is done that and nonetheless at the same time i think he is charged off in many dissimilar counsel i just do not know what to make of this album evening after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when i would rather have left it alone i am aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this is not fall out sadly it is the opponent effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and can not face listening to some of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london anthem i am expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time before long and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the plunder down sound groban washington hoping to achieve to me it just doe not flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it is trying to be so many dissimilar thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the grade i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad pigeonhole of what love is often written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes feb song can express a far outstanding profundity of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark involve the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can approximate evening holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically evening if it sometimes miss the grade i can not face giving this one star because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to pushing their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i can not cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic ocean sadly it is staying in the packaging to be gifted to person that i am probably not that unaired to edited to lend i have noticed some commenting involve what i said about fan posting positive review because of a sensed backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official get on entitled be sure to bequeath a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that mass who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not drive at merely boosting the value of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread washington charge a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it is only clean to point that out and mass can then decide for themselves
0	how can the album be when the track separately are each one by one what kind of price gouging is this
0	i am a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the blame around it is been a long time since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it it is just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding i am aware live is live but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio i am really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit i think this wa just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved i am still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this one aint gon na cut it sorry
1	a landmark album
0	it is a good song but nicky minaj is featured i do not like the way she sings
1	a very strong set of song both lyrically and melodically and robin is in good voice throughout

0	not the archetype version
1	i am a little late to join the party when it come to this artist but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for thinking out loud on youtube i did not realize it had been played to death on the radio according to friend i love the cd it is awesome to find an artist that actually play real instrument writes their own music with lyric that actually convey human emotion wonder never cease
1	with child great
0	it is just a preference it is not my cup of tea that is all too heavy going for young child i think
0	i bought this for my month old and she is not impressed by it at all she much rather listens to the radio guess i could have saved the money
1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of recording not that there is anything wrong with that it is just a refreshing change for his fan
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the bluff sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the recently would have have submitted to keep company a a demo i understand being an artist and elaborate the bounardies but with this album i fail to get wind that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that tar johnson take a firm stand on using renewable source of energy to index his recording sitting i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
1	i do not pretend to be associate with the detail of bronze career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i have not yet heard all of her s era release because they are a little unmanageable to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the printing that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into el careen that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edge album all the same an artist is going to follow her own itinerary plain but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead careen because she is good at it and her voice is well accommodate for it the hetero album is something that fan of careen and female vocalist should snap up at their first chance because although it ha some underage downside it is akin to a buried pop careen treasure since there is no track listing here i will do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again span a chord progression dissimilar anything i have heard before just a great understated careen tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the vallecula here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple pleximetry and later some insidious keyboard but here is where bronze unique voice polish through it is unmanageable for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly insure and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even yr after i first heard this platter cut the fruit is a little low down a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional vallecula between verse and chorus there is a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar cave in in the bridge then back to that glide vallecula then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an precipitous terminal just an excellent vallecula from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it is vocal over acoustic guitar something that normally drill hole the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this birdsong is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french piano accordion but it all mesh absolutely the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to institutionalise american producer running like frightened rabbit if you have spent much time listening to japanese careen and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing ingredient of the conflate how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv lunar month koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san erst of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto mark how or why japan ha an abundance of transcription engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad that is the case at any rate ame to gamu is an unforgettable birdsong and bronze vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my cheek every time i listen to this birdsong is the fact that the end three chord of the birdsong are a quote of that three chord forecast in jimis wind cry mary whether that is incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best birdsong on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the transcription the heavier voice are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those birdsong that is like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build detonate in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to terminal on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your aliveness a birdsong that is been with you for yr that tribe is powerful songwriting just a great birdsong easily one of my all time faves it is unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great birdsong no joker start with bronze sly vocal over soft and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her swan too much amid repeat of the line i wide area network na be your woman i wide area network na be your woman it is not a horrific birdsong but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow vallecula with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool torrent there is a well an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage fantasm in the middle of a fantasm is the most jazzy tune on the platter more in line with the stuff she is done since but an excellent relaxed vallecula daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric soft and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the birdsong which lead me to consider it is one of those birdsong that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a surmisal since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language viz where is the beer where is the restroom and i honey you generally in that order and i have not sat down to translate it tree cheeseparing out the album in a dreamy atmospherical wash with bronze voice processed through a thin radio mic dapple that fit the birdsong absolutely there are two cave in into wearisome tempo vallecula that are really more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the birdsong an understated but relentlessly cool tune i am far more a careen roast than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero is her standout platter for that careen ingredient but again i still have not gotten around to getting her other platter if you like el careen that is generally upbeat rather than a monolithic boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent

0	frankly i have no what the other review is trying to say however i will issue a caution to considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of level and not the version you probably know from the radio if you are a dj this be a great addition to your collection if not well might be you are looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive
1	bonk love this song
1	great vocal
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides bully support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song spell itself is only so so and the more stripped down down demo version on the shorter disc are not bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weakly and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so maybe a single disc edition would be fine for most fan overall a bully recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing specially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied pallette
1	mix in well with other song in slight cardio workout when you get a little winded this will help keep you up

0	i have been a fan of heart angstrom unit since but i must say this album is a stinker i thought the sister wilson wanted to rock on this record sorry but i aint hearing it here
1	this second single from the turn new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad constitute john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song but it is still a ancestry good song with a great message of letting love world power cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along the line of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good rock band
1	if you do not dance you not help move to this music

0	i some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the breath pure insult his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pas for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone a isch fuzztone that ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for sizzling blue guitar

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and song one of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton proscribed blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either newmarket the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if take heed you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you newmarket have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster multitude drum john brockman drum and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal well flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a one angstrom unit treating u to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i extra wa not paying to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we newmarket get a chicago cd i am heart not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i doctor of osteopathy do not mind if i do not like the record album song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye more or le of artistic creation the producer artistic creation and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can inward trust to write and record it own information technology music only a name love to milk a inbound they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend angstrom unit the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha made an key out art angstrom unit of mediocrity and lack of vision washington and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of all seem those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play drum on of the song this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of huff others if he wa proud of wretched them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after miff a thinking pause of past year what to choose to go out on and what legacy bear and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance pitiful to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable from any out take from any of the album newmarket from simply to written and performed in great part by others love is an unworthy epitaph for a band angstrom unit that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of constitute churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you mister are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who made the song and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some unwisely good playing by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album and good no more production buy it and love it
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled identical banner
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying she actually sound like she is trying id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture please do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do i am forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is very generous a i do not even think it is worthy of review i only do this to warn my fellow music lover
0	this is not the version that you are looking for have not found the version sung on ondine yet dang it
0	they used to be cool every song on this album sound the same this record could not be more boring and redundant they should drop an n because there is no point in listening to it it blow do not buy this

0	i wa counting down the day to this album being released i listen to sturgills first two album often and could not wait for new stuff so i buy the album on release day and start listening what the heck is this the st track is ok the nirvana cover is absolutely putrid the rest of the album is just boring and generic huge disappointment
1	the sound is rich the harmony are deep the arrangement are master copy i have played it many time and recommended it to friend
1	love it hate it it is to live on a one of the greatest album of all time forever remembered a the that made the majority of people remember what good rock music wa some of knew it wa called the underground scene i mean let face it if anyone remembers and i do not mean being you know that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away rock wasnt supposed to be that good not that time anyways it changed the mainstream for the better i dunno basically hmmm i wonder what they will like next remember the spin doctor bush yea a far a underground go i have never read any underground legend say anything bad about nirvana biafra rollins joey ramone iggy heck iggy used to go to nirvana show and go insane if ive heard all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspiration to nirvana music yea even jello bottom line is this they put out lp b side lp a acoustic album that everyone away a nd time and basically had everyone talking act like korn system of a down tool manson blink where are they gon na be in year more importantly how are they gon na be remembered i have no idea but i know how nirvana is going to be remembered for the next billion this album is the reason why nevermind
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need no more it for exampl e because no more of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder a complete and utter waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe may genuinely in fact lower your emotional intelligence but will certainly line the pocket of daniel duologue goleman do not waste your money on this no help whatsover book
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature i absolutely loved hellbilly delux and sinister urge wa all right but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired let it all bleed out is all right but i would take any track from hellbilly over it bring back the old rob zombie
1	good
1	beautiful great acoustic great ballad
1	great album for the linkin parking area fan
1	you either get it or you do not but if you do get it then you will love it unique spacey cosmic trippy technical and melodic overall it is a great solid album recommended faultfinder to fan of voivod information technology toxik watchtower rush vector atheist cynic or any other technical prog band
0	bwb is a great collaboration but this album dropped the ball every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any whatever genre the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual early work i am not sure what intent for that wa sung but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through not this
1	great worship with child song
0	i evergreen state eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had kick the bucket wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more clock time i realized it evergreen state actually the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a forte piano concert with someone cantabile along in the background the forte piano virtually drowned out her voice this evergreen state also the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the memorialise did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company
1	leon cut up adding his own deserving flair to some classic hank williams country tune the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album wrongfulness also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than in that location the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there is anything wrong with that it is just a refreshing change for his fan
0	i am very disappointed the wording on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original artist it is not it is a mix sung by a wedding singer cruise line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be published with remake of original artist song without the permission of the original artist hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song very misleading and disappointing
0	i downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sound absolutely awful it is just way too compressed so it is extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range almost unlistenable i honestly do not think you can blame a lot angstrom unit of this on the mp encoding one k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have plenty of mp s that sound fine with lesser bit angstrom unit rate
1	one of the best compilation a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of compile rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope then group like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they also nurture one with child synphonic appreciation thus rock and compiling roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece
1	saw him on agt and loved his version of this song had to buy it will hopefully get some other song
0	will not child play on my android ripoff
0	i have not heed to it due to technical problem
0	unsuccessful abortive purchase
0	very disappointed identical by this cd which i will probably listen to only once ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate and his voice is nothing special his butchering of constitute on broadway is particularly heinous i would have given the cd one wizard star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune a waste of money
1	this is a awesome cd full of cruchy guitar dual alone thumping bass and pounding drum everything tou would expect from stryper and more
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal i love to hear her sing if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs vocalise you will be left hand wanting more while i applaud the idea of trying something newfangled it did not work here the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal it is just that simple
0	not a bad bond title song but no excuse why this is not on soundtrack cd adele should be boycotted barbara should be ashamed of herself causing cubby to roll over in his grave
1	worth information technology it
1	while the use of something other than xylophone piano in a few track took me back dylan juda moment i still recommend this wonderful series my baby fell asleep within minute of first firing up and hopefully ha planted some subliminal love the pixy to share with the future the stone one is good too but mike please remove the electric from monkey go to heaven for u purist
0	i think it is a shame eve that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything bad like lacuna coil or echo of eternity this is by far the worst cd unsound i have gotten in a long time and the first that made me big write a review the singer may be the worst i have ever heard even my cat cd sound better i am very bitter about the i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music
1	could not believe there were no star review this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play it wa so nice to find on cd also bought a copy for my daughter who also love it

1	excellent song and very spirited
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice the title track some are lake is the strongest with it narrative of lost young love the band next album cloak and cipher is even better

1	love it jill at her best
0	not a lover skip this song each time
1	courier michael john poirier ha a soothing voice that match his sublime lyric i love information technology two song on this album especially forgiven and the maiden and the messenger forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who ha an angelic voice i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it asking what i thought of the song i loved it the first time i eer heard it and have loved it ever since the refrain angstrom unit is something that will stay with you always if you hear it i still find myself eer singing that refrain in the back of my head the album is try worth it try for just these two song the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ drawn by a mutual friend
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule whatever happened to good old fashioned church music i am serious this type of music known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano nirvana wa not a good band the lead yeller committed suicide which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan if you are like me you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself a my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church

0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it sound like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first album
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound the music here is strong throughout the cd and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it is pretty simple if you are a big fan of the movie you will highly enjoy this sound track if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie you will also like this soundtrack strongly recommended
0	love this song but wa very discomfited in how soft the background vocal are hard to achieve a good blend

0	i always liked this song i like the werewolf of london too he is a great classic rock angstrom unit artist to listen to
0	the entitle of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there washington a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitar player which i am guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label gen just a list of the song and not in the order that they are on the cd i am not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a high pitched register steve earle his interpretation seem to overlook the point of the archetype by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the designate goofy fun the same go for dirty world the wilburys assay mark washington an easygoing humor that is completely missing he doe not overlook altogether handle with caution make it a a slower tempo lay and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune up i would think he rocked but a whole record of this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise i would label this for completists only but i am a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could get stake
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song this nonpareil is a great example
1	outstanding blue
0	i had pre promising oredered this album on itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell in love with bright eye when i heard their album i am wide record album awake it is morning one the gentle yet strong instrument and focus on vocal had a large calming effect on me which is why one i grew to love bright eye however this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered most turn of the song rely heavily on electric instrument and a distorted sound that come off a angry instead of thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone
0	can not determine if music downloaded can not find where it downloaded or to what file will not download from amazon music again due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	disappointing

1	sarah mclachlan ha such a beautiful voice make it sound a if an angel is singing the song one of many audio tremendous song released by sarah mclachlan
0	what is the most annoying this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave track such a take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable
0	the song that i is cut off and doe not end correctly it stop in the middle of a i could not use it
0	love greg hate this song own to this one should never been recorded should return it but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase clitoris lousum
0	though i will take some responsibility i download from itunes should could have listened to the sample my bad how can they use the same name a an already existing band and produce music like this while using that name really it should be an outrage i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for oh well i will just shabu it up to my own carelessness hopefully it will not add up up in random very often
0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe but this just wasnt up to her usual it felt comparable she wa trying hard to address a younger le universal audience it also felt comparable she had forced the new sung they did not flow and the male vocal did not mix with her voice disappointing
0	i attended a workshop given by expect mary desrosiers back when she angstrom unit first released this album i wa very disappointed to find bear that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it is the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa constitute disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in washington her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token commentary her story behind angstrom unit billy boy is shop that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she had not known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in past the entire little taradiddle house series bilgewater if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking
1	i had a favorite album back in high school entitled the rock album can not seem to locate hera it anywhere but here on amazon i can piece the album together using itunes voila
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album his i have bought and no in case you are wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it did not hurt thing though i will get right the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille that is the bad thing the good thing greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids cliche and when a woman love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you not move is about getting on life through the round here take a look at small and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood is not anything new here this is territory that is been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it is definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time
0	sounded like a mexican band not country not my style song sounded the same no if you are looking for country this is not for you

0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made turn some friend with good enough equipment to make a timber cd gag with her lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to angstrom unit come out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to

1	here we have another prime example of dmb information technology doing what they do best live show this show is special for quite a few reason one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run if you were a member of banding the warehouse you could have gotten both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last release sound issue live in surprisal new york this release sound amazing and on a side constitute note i could not really hear any problem with devotee the new york release but i digress prove the show start with an explosive you might die trying a great way to start thing off dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song you can tell this wish is a special night for the band and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a nice surprise for the fan that go straight into yet measure another incredible and like every fan know dave and the stripe band always re invent the song there is so much energy in this show it really feel like you are there in the crowd after the newfangled incredible two step dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop if you are a fan just buy because you know it is good if you are new still buy it and see the magic that prove is dmb live dave and the boy still volatile prove that after along year they have no partial tone sign of slowing down or stopping what angstrom unit they do best and if you are lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer i am sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of the song on this album have an over driven distortion sound effect when you hear the song live the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance but on the album version the distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music i ran the album through a live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is

0	very pathetic recording quality
1	a star is comport
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pas the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those are not successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year
0	still a glorious voice but the arrangement suck too lounge y only a piano when some of these require riotous arrangement
0	see social occasion jewel cross over from her folk country root to pop laced with heavy wrongfulness inward beat and keyboard this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing affair overall papa i think that she will look back on this one with regret

0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this newfangled candle set with cracking anticipation when it arrived we immediately slid it into the candle player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u very cool there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it look like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste but i must say this one wa a bust we never listen to it and had we previewed it would decidedly never have purchased it
0	this is a hijack recording from a mono copy of the lp it is complete with tic and pop the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo part of the recording i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master taping and wa very disgusted with the sound my worn cassette copy wa much considerably i would give it a zero for the rating if i could the public presentation is wonderful and exciting but badly murder by the transfer do not buy this under any circumstance instead look for the original rca cd this should have been properly labeled a aad mono

0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is not well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who seemed to sell million of record were in bad taste musically this cd take that to whole other level
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney i thought this wa going to humbled be a bigger crash one and burn with their proscribed voice only one for kanye wa absolutely awful and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney four five second is absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the worst song she ha came out with and she need to really find her constitute mo voice all over again and for kanye it is clash the most rogue thing he ha simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need show me state much stronger for her next work and she wasted her own saame time with low gimmick song d

0	non did not order this item
1	love anything josh bonk sings
1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there is anything wrong with that it is just a refreshing change for his fan
1	i have listened to this album probably time since this morning i have been a long time volbeat fan these blackguard bring it all to the table with this album trust me get it now

0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist which i guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label name just a list of the song and not in the order that they are on cd i am not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a register steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the go for world the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor that is completely missing he doe not miss altogether handle with make it a a slower tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i would think he rocked but a whole record of this one is murder and anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise i would label this for completists only but i am a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could back
1	nice product recommend this seller

0	okay this effort is more inspired than victim of love or at but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky chateau rock of the westies etc many of the song on the fox frustratingly close being classic ej song just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the song fall a bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which is not a great album but is a better example of elton john to anything even close to his form

0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic rock magazine issue march it purport to be a collection of tune up that have been lost in time overlooked stone and curio that might be of interest to hard rock fan ummm well part of that plan ha been achieved they are certainly curio curio from the realm of indifference propagation because that is what you will probably feel when hearing to these track sure tucky buzzard ha had some reason to be and a few of these track might pique the interest of the occasional aficionado but much of it is so eclectic it is hard to see anybody hearing to these number and thinking to themselves hey i got ta get me some more tune up by the aynsley dunbar retaliation and i do not will not to dis this taster even though that is what i am doing it is just that people into these band probably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl and zippo here is likely to convert the not already converted if you get my heading anyway i played this once and that wa a chore

1	one of the best compilation a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope group like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they also nurture one synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece

0	adam voice so buried under the effect that is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star wa never that his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he could not match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cd did not sell to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we do not need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad

0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i washington very defeated to find that she had only a nodding familiarity with the little house news report evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it is the detail that really count when it came to the music i washington defeated further to find that desrosiers used different birdcall than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot on in the long winter instead of using the lyric render however desrosiers determine to substitute a british sailor drinking birdcall claiming that lauras father washington really something of a lush by the same token her news report derriere billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the birdcall to pa when he came home from running around town and she had not known where he washington no incident like that is find oneself anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just depend for some example of pioneer birdcall this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep depend

1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this nightmare is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure saint thomas evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few constitute collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is incubus a much much darker evil grating sound it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie for inward whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun information technology bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the sun a nasty burn now operating theater is not that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all a lot of his kid it is just fantastically brilliant

0	after adequate if a little bland debut album i expected great thing from lifehouse although second album are known to be difficult i beleived the band to have promise how wrong wa i there is not a song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face it all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way but there is no melody on this album worth writing about i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you lifehouse because of no name face trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy eat world even the calling whose album i also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere

0	i need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you look up the word music class brass professional and you will see chicago anyone who know me know that chicago is and ha been my favourite group since dirt hand down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every album and every cd twice my key chain say chicago my refrigerator and front door ha chicago magnet inside and out anything with the chicago logo on it get saved need more proof of my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i did not say anything when this group started re issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vibrant part of the music scene it is not easy to stay current for year and please everyone when the new guy came on the scene you did not hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera wa gone jeff wa in and that is that i did not ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath and frankly i did not want them to even the drummer tris imboden wa musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but folk this is not right chicago ha more talent than this part of me want very hard to salute them for being there for year the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day chicago and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago i do not know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my mom said that if i did not have anything nice to say then i should not say anything but i am not getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and can not wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the shade and bolt the door and turn off the telephone thank goodness i have other chicago album to listen to better luck next time fella maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen

0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album i have never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum i have bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing they have gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what you would hear in a disco very disappointing i will not buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless i am saying goodbye to any limitation i am saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you you are limitless nothing too hard for you you are limitless there is nothing you can not do you are bigger and you are greater and you are stronger i know you are limitless you are limitless and that is it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

0	no this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c is not a good a re publica she wa on car wheel true i have always liked lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop music constitute she is been a constant factor not constitute always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock her life ha not always been easy which is reflected in her voice in route this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it is a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra think verse on each is along excessively good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumble but that is not really the main problem she ha always mumbled all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and strong it ha information technology never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra information technology time to pick up all the word what make this angstrom unit album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel i have heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only pine tree state vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone trusted horribly wrong there is even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad some review praise her sound which gentle is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested and stale a pallid if a instrumentalist group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music it is the sound amaze of old beer tired superb muscle and autumn rain record album it is the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing be musician tween whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job washington ha computer memory lucinda finally lost it have all the sweet smelling year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although populace the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked hour angle her previous album where she had direction more than enough song to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying three fold so and in a cycle world where good and original songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one however wa just a big yawn to me
0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had try heard it turn out that is the only good song on sung it the rest of the cd is not anything i want to listen to what else can i say steer clear

0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart tape everyone already ha and is not that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized wa brickwalled in the stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect rough mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix territorial pissing wanted to love them but overall i do not i do prefer the on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum it is nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it is that much fabled innocence period now to at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and hardcover book for depending you got get it with the light out is currently around and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased on it like most of all of disc and part of disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been available a a high quality audio bootleg since immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for the dvd for or what do you miss out on not not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this to spread the

0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song are great but the remastering wa entirely pointless

1	great song i am not that much into country but might be changing not all the way but will checking out love the song
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it is multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something you would hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song you would think air would produce with it is western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it is fun but also lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey that is something you will probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if you have ever seen air live you would know what i am talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if you have heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what i have mention so far with regard to lyrical absence i have always been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it is swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there is just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if you are going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it is little sister acoustic and laid back in it is approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it is distorted harmonica interlude it is bound to sooth whatever sorrow you are experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it is hand picked guitar segment and it is front line horn melody it is a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but i am not ruing out a higher score it is definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who is been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released i would say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole new market denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe give it a go and do not give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
1	promise made on point mountain ha to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard this entire cd is so calming i can not explain the sense of peace that come over me when i take heed to it if you are looking for something relaxing and uplifting i would highly recommend it

0	doe a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music scene it would not have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it is that is how easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he is been anointed by his fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to choose from i think the you have given in to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so that there is nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

0	imputable i agree expression with the two other review saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak atomic number due to age i guess and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with ascribable videodisk csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash he lack the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and stop challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe

0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting it is terrible ok net ball u scratch it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell eve the album version would be acceptable that birdcall is undeniably a stone classic in every single sense of the word it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is untenable that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of birdcall that do not deserve to be here more than half the third disc is food waste from their worst class of songwriting then some classic that do not really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry goodly and the last time really better birdcall than can not you get wind me knocking moonlight mile net ball it bleed and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby do not stop over album geld like sway bitch and monkey man i contract you want to have a collection that span their entire career but they should really focus on the gold class instead than equal time allowed for these awful geld hell i mean eve we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choice look i know i have a bias i love these boy disregarding whatever family the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time but eve a a major major fan i would not recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone i geld my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band it is basically the same story here although they were smarting enough to add up she wa blistering eve though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the euphony obviously i mean some of these birdcall still bring a bout to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but do not contract this album it is not charles frederick worth the price find a ally who love the stone if you are smarting you will have a few and enquire them to make you a mix or contract lick used for a couple buck just stay away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up i am going to my room and putting on gummy finger
0	home for christmas sound innocent enough you would be well advised to stay from this home it a horrible place you will be asking santa for some ear plug if you purchase this cd alternately you can buy it for people on your christmas list that you do not or just plain hate how bad is some say that the cia used it to torture hardened terrorist suspect in guantanamo had them babbling like baby in minute but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland go ahead and buy it you must after all the man ha a private jet and he is got ta pay for that fuel somehow
1	another classic

0	do not download just this song you only get the tail end when they are singing the do do du dupe share
0	but this is a poorly produced cd both the computer enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solo and the overuse of vibrato in the solo make this a definite disappointment
1	after watching the movie secretariat this had to be a part of my playlist
1	i am not a parent but i play one on tv but i used to be a nanny my yr old twin obsessed over hi and i have to say some of their tune were pretty darn catchy i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more you know the one that got stuck in my strait all day long that i could whistle along with the register a though i would written them myself hah to make a collection cd out of them this being one of those song i admit i really did not mind too much having to listen to them every single clock time we got in the car and went someplace if i am going to be forced to listen to something over and over on a daily basis there are alir worse thing it could be if you have got loretta young kid give this song a whirl
0	not one memorable song disappointing
1	these two are awing
1	i hated their voice at starting time and i hated the lyric but i listened to the whole thing twice and it actually is kinda catchy but everyone is different for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it very just depends on how the music ring inside your ear
0	because the song cut where the explicit word would go i wish i could get a refund i ended up buying the explicit version instead
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the price it is offered i have no ruefulness about this purchase
1	information technology absolutely love it one of my favorite song at the moment
1	this review is for the vinyl l p version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems reasonably good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone particularly shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite wide even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one l p they were not this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my frame up the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did appear to be a number of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the real music i have only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the mode through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there is really nothing on this album that would be accommodate towards being bet on the radio and that is because it is one of those album that is obviously have in mind to be listened to a a whole it is really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it is nothing spectacular but it is a well put together album and very soft on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will value it even more after extra listening
0	this recent purchase wa resold for a couple dollar it is virtually all noise the vocal by mick jagger are ragged and imo there is not a exclusive good song among the lot
0	the record album is great so do not think the star are for that it get lower star scab because it is censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this when you buy a record album rough it will be labeled expressed but i that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being expressed but this record album wa done before he suit a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the security review is enough to ruin it i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people do not get screwed over i screw i am not the only i who had this problem and this is not the only record album for which this is a issue again great record album but buy the cd so you get it rough and skip the download
1	here is another release from a band that had been dormant for year so here is verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never fan of experimental side of celtic frost and while there is some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all work organically to achieve scary the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest you will ever come across the song are lengthy and repetitious and that is what make them while it is hard to classify this opus it is safe to say that it is a doom metal album there is a of stuff on it never boring deep into the music and you will find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one the best album of so far

0	i expected to get the song i heard on youtube not this one with half of the lyric deleted not what i wanted at all
0	i need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you look up the word music classify brass professional and you will determine chicago anyone who bang me bang that chicago is and hour angle been my favourite group since dirt paw down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every album and every cd twice my key chain say chicago my refrigerator and front door hour angle chicago magnet inside and out anything with the chicago logo on it get saved need more proof of my commitment this cd sadden this loyal fan to the point of heartache i did not say anything when this group started re issuing album and go on to count them a progressive roman numeral issue i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vivacious part of the music tantrum it is not easy to stay current for year and please everyone when the new guy came on the tantrum you did not hear me utter ominous of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera wa gone jeff wa in and that is that i did not ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath and frankly i did not lack them to even the drummer tris imboden wa musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing their own tack of go on chicago talent into the plica but folk this is not right chicago hour angle more talent than this part of me lack very hard to salute them for being there for year the other part say that i will not pay gamy ticket price to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day chicago and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago i do not bang maybe i am just bring to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to kindred xxx to elevator music a fountainhead if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i bang my ma said that if i did not have anything nice to say then i should not say anything but i am not bring a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one ordinarily i am stoked and can not wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the tint and bolt the door and become off the telephone thank goodness i have other chicago album to listen to better circumstance next time fella maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen
0	i liked this song until i watched the video come on then robin thicke got twerked on by miley ugh while his wife played it cool for a while eventually she left him and finally he say he ha addiction issue am i only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where singer actor personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song see anything by amy winehouse all thing brad pitt gwyneth paltrow or rihanna
1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruise and this song doe it for me it brings back all the memory
0	i picked up this cd weave after listening to some sample very good i enjoyed most every song except carried by the wind when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier a if earlier i would heard it before i listened a few more time and yes i had heard it before it is a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song but not only that farish also inserted the same snip clip of child laughing that amethystium u in their song avalon from sole their odonata album what is up with that unless there is good explanation for this copying the song clock carried by past the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me
0	disc wa not stopping at all it played for time of day over and over
0	buyer beware this is only a sample of the track it is only a second clip not charles frederick worth
1	listen to it so much had to order another one want to make sure it doe not wear out
0	erase deleted
0	i got it for free at st i did not really like it i like black veil bride and the fray it is just not my kind of music now i like this song though i had to hear it a couple of time before it hit home
0	i have ordain time the same product from amazon and the th track had a problem on both
0	i owned the original music spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original string for the main line this u brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent this aint that for those who relish soundtrack this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement the man from uncle i do not the lalo shiffren version of the from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at that is of my budget nostalgia and there are no track listing and if were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling
1	for lover of david arkenstone and others the windham hill label this album is a keeper very relaxing and peaceful while not putting you to sleep i love to work late at night and this music is great for that
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters
1	americium i am in love
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician they are the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song i am for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect album you will not go wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i can not praise it enough
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different picture of the eight doctor they should have name it dr who and daleks calendar almost john r major all the picture are from the peter crushing movie or comic book like picture there key out is only one of tom baker and bear one of john petwee this calendar should be only for major dr who and dalek fan

1	man i wore this cd out when i evergreen state a kid and the music is timeless best compelation i ever had and i got it with a burrito you do not get any better than that
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer seem to think if are stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album is not for you but is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to mainly because of the lyric this wa the third a strong alices others being flush the fashion and special force all three while they do not match most of his album deliver hard rock good while drifting away from alices horror persona in of alice the stand up it work the weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which have tipped u off what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
1	california love the greatest song of all time why everybody go to cali it is mostly the west coast a for me florida is nigh like california i live in orlando which is mostly part of central florida particularly all part around the sunshine state
0	all the song started sounding the same le than half way through sad because lead off we really liked him on the show
0	pre ordered it and when the album wa released i only got strain in stead of all of them on the album release date
0	showed item to artist and wa told it wa fake checked artist copy and it is completely different
1	excellent work of art interview she is on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative bad girl image some people sung want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question this is a top quality production
0	this album just did not do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cd and do it them to death it is too girly and poppy for me high hawk the lyric are not all that clear and do not mesh well together to mean one thing most of all the tune of the song are hard to listen to you sleep with how some song are just difficult for the ear to enjoy these song are fine most of the clock but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the tune or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few genuinely enjoyable feeling filled song though verify secret and sleepwalking get star from me the rest get about star i can not relate to them much and i do not get much pleasure from listening to them but i will constantly do it tbms older stuff and their newer hide and seek album
1	man i wish i wa on the u missouri when cher wa there getting her sing on
1	great quality super fast download
0	i had to pay to listen to this song even tho i am sung a prime member and it is prime music
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen i wa pleasantly surprised from the first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming some of the tune i could not wait to play it again
1	fine ticket cd
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i angstrom unit can infer from pale listening to her music and pollyannaish i have not yet heard all of her s era release because they are a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged stone album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because she is good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity ditto mark because although it ha some minor downside it is washington akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there is no track listing here i will do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with constitute more or le a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chorus line chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything i have heard before just nowadays a great understated rock hour angle tune down is far more poppy but with the same john lennon arresting vocal attitude the groove stone here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but here is where tanes unique voice shine through it is difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice sung reminds me of rush along phoebe snow maybe it because of that turn strange vibrato which first class sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even year after i first heard some other this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional one groove between verse and chorus there angstrom unit is a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then over again a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it is vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding constitute there is a lot of really in that location weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if you have spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the pallid background but rather is an integral catalyzing element pacing of the mix how or why japan ha some of the unequalled most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer background and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i angstrom unit am really really glad that is the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost cryptic forgot something that put a vocal music big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether that is incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance chorus line in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted constitute pianoforte you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song that is like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief along acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of pallid the most moving experience of your life a song that is been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it is unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line perfect i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it is not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward goody get down and a vertebral column little inward annoying and the bridge is information technology just weird and not in a take over good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty inward vocal melody record album and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there is also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line associate in nursing with the stuff she is done since but an excellent relaxed sir thomas more groove wondrous daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over wish electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead st me to believe foreign it is one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since account my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the chemical element restroom and i love you generally in that order and i have not potent sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed for the most part through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two elusive break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune i am far devotee more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i tuner like from later album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still have not gotten around to pallid getting her other disc if you like land alt rock that is generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely sung time well spent
0	didnt order
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike and try to avoid about hollywood production terrible

1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect it is better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i did not give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen to when you are awake but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those song the others are great i loved the price on this and it wa definitely worth it

0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most men however i find this cd completely pointless tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a year old unclassifiable produced music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some would know that cd with a penis on the cover and a like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling point trust me they aint
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such little imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already their niche in the music world history and that they do it so very badly band like the people touch white witch armageddon and the list go on and on were one of a kind and yet modern band continue to those name for themseles then release inferior common boring music and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in on the name others pathetic

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in story the intense praise this band get is downright sicken how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a interahamwe from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun attention getting toe tapping fun in the and just about all rock music wa about amusement it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst rag suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa pitiful cypher had any fun any more if a band show up still the slightest signboard of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the stuck in the wellspring if making music for amusement purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an thing to do then the is where i wishing to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the foremost time in year and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i do not recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most lower music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide do not poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge

0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is not well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is stuffy to a second clip sampling on random shuffle i opinion people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who seemed to trade trillion of record were in badly taste musically this cd take that to a whole other level

0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time do not even compare in vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real person personality with her first album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the use up world what she could do on her own term person and in her own word stripped is my absolute favorite album of sung all time she sang from the heart populace and great experience she took u on a journey of finding her own voice in the figurative and literal sense writing imbibe her own song and working with the people she wanted to work with bear teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing she is ever done career wise i interpreter do not know what happened between them but she ha prove not been the same xtina i fell in love with on impudent stripped though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work adjourn it did not quite catch the essence of papa strippeds christina bionic wa a huge fail even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it star but they are nowhere near memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual solar day but either she operating theater constitute need to retire from music or get it together

1	great uplifting soul church doctrine album from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old school completely type soul voice i have heard this year these are all original song too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is systematically consistently good listening from church doctrine start to finish i do have favourite though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hope too high breathe love maybe i am not the man evil woman which i am sure peradventure u the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country though this is stop not acknowledged they do not know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop atomic number i will never know i would never have heard of them if not constitute for a uk excessively based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can

1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive other disco hit without really paying much attention in my thirty i dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert the bee gee album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice i would ever heard in my life from that moment on i bee gee album available and solely to myself to robin gibbs voice what a rewarding journey that wa his range never failed to delight and me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously the huge album from the seventy did not interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album i have often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he had been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the pop song after all his voice could easily have any style or genre this album come the closest to that just listen to do not cry alone if you do not believe me and while many of the track are once again pop they are more mature both in lyric and in vocal and i love that he u his terrific range from one song the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely so well naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you are going to buy this album if you are simply music lover you owe to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice

1	phenomenal recording on th century record from the great pianist inward ahmad jamal with the other two membranophone member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released proscribed on cd it command premium in the collector market and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician i remember when i had the track of this back in the that comfortably i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl land copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doe not bequeath come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format which i have done with many out of print vinyl album still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal play jamal is superb with angstrom unit ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horn and string by evans two of the piece pasture and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill a well my favorite piece on the album swahililand is also the longest broaden at almost ten minute and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the mho background horn and string before inward he kick read in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on conga al ternating from left channel to right jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the tour de force astonish it is the final track on the album and close it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may coif gamal abdel nasser and paul serrano i have an recollective extensive collection of jamals output widening over the year and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal play jamal is my favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to regard cd including the front and back album constitute cover sound turnout better than ever
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase the song were not the kind i enjoy i believe it sold by jakes name
0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace when voice leaf you assumably asleep for minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect a the fire in the fireplace fortunately it wa only a cent wasted expenditure there are some good sleep aid recording available but this is not one of them
0	condition wa stated acceptable hardly satisfactory listenable
0	it doe not work i bought it or time this wa a digital purchase
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still do not the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because i am drunk it is just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i do not get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doe not seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i have not given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it is a miracle we all not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have have something changing all the time in of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i do not think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it a blessing that one can conveniently download cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted like jeanne while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina her husband left brain exploit her fashion story of wearing pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for those of you who were not i can think better of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne

1	k the most visionary musically complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of performance is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why

0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canada self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture record album from angstrom unit her previous album emotional rain claim her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere one rock genre i like la singing and la p demonstrates information technology her talent but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening tolerable note of the first track placement in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it is music without melody or purpose and even though some of bear the arrangement are at time but tonal pattern rarely adequate you will not be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous purport album since they will have nothing to compare it with but if you are somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional peradventure lee aaron

0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album bluntly speaking it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single then stop searching for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul i heard killing time on a community channel on cable it wa being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction
1	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a perfect tense great catchy rhythm you may have heard it is cover in pitch perfect
0	i love the classic moonglows recording so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl oops i downloaded i wa wrong and it wa completely not the original doo wop version of the song this version ha a strong background track it is highly produced it is just off this is just my taste but the new version of the tune wa awful and not what i wa looking for at all anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i not do my research i give this album a because it ha a couple new track but there are only and most are from his free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which ha track and is a lot better it ha good track flow great and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity
0	i bought album for some old favorite i remember the playlist number the correct song title but the song that play is different most song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite when irish whisky eye are smiling who put the overall macnamaras band etc were not really what played very strange but a waste of money
0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart studio apartment tape that everyone already ha and is not that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then they got real lounge around when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering microscope stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it ache your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no uncertainty the boombox dry run tape and the devon mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devon mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial reserve pee pee etc i precious to love them but overall i do not i do prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the deep sound like a deep people who are seriously into applied science seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum it is nothing i notice though also if you sick na see hardcore nirvana fan get really slopped off google sound city cockamamy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here a good deal better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the rage it is that a good deal fabled utmost innocence period now to get at what you incur in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardback reserve for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover reserve both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been available a a high gear quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for or so what do you miss out on not a good deal not a good deal seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to circulate the truth

0	pre ordered it and when the album wa released i only got song in stead of all of them on the album release date
1	you know i am just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the remainder from original to remastered but i will say paying or or for this seven albulm set is tremendous i am probably like a large dependant on of springsteen fan i became cognizant during the born in the usa tour then purchased all the previous cassette so in the live on year cassette were lost and or became obsolete now i am able to purchase all seven for what amount to each that is a win veracious there and like a number of people i find the first seven springsteen to be the respectable sans a couple of live album so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with
0	scream this album is awful i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day royce too since the late budden is a peachy lyricist joell is dope he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year the first album evergreen state really good some filler on it it evergreen state recorded in day they took year on this album most of the sung dynasty released on the internet before the first album dropped were peachy so many quotables super acid lantern freestyle evergreen state sick the mastering on this album suck period i am listening on a rega system where is the production from the alchemist they fathom peachy over just blaze production on the sung dynasty with em they are trying to mother into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly they choice the worst beat from these producer yes these guy can rime why can not they make good sung dynasty unless they are rapping over someone el beat the single were weak but i expected that guest feature from cee lo singing that awful hook busta skyler grey never heard of her bob swizz and em wtf i blame eminem jemmy iovine and interscope book yes these guy deserve success but not with this album knick knack paddy wack how i wan na bone cmon joell these reviewer are saying they are bringing back lyric i am going to listen to the hip hop weekly series mood muzik the bar exam and pretend our house never came out and to that first reexamination sea wolf mike r a p music is the album of the year so far

1	a play and lovely song to sing along to i bought this version to play in the car for the little one this is a classic must for child
0	this band wa my religion and my law for that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doe not sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doe not bother me on this album it is simple get the job done no silly flashy playing like usually doe dare i say may finally be playing with sort of feeling one of the few strong this album it pain to say that since he wa a when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it is pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly is not the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha this album not is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon and it kind of reminds me of sign the hammer lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot in a please soth is an awesome album and this is not at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let u take a look at each song the lord of steel off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again ha moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why is not singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it is like an incessant hum of tone and that is a because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric are not good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this the type of song that requires a movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i do not know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell head for border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it is time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i did not download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre i am sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a it is own the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos have feeling kept demaios ego in line until he could not take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the i will do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you can not argue with crazy some believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too
1	it sound great and the price wa right
0	the orchestral piece have a lot of white noise in the background and many song cut off half way through

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if you foolishly like me buy album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum john brockman drum and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar key a well a treating u to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i wa not paying to hear him and his other friend he called the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to those other people i would have asked their name in the shop not ask for chicago it too to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely matter of personal taste but good or i to listen to chicago i do not if i do not like the song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music only a to milk a they did with chicago but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the of who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha an art of mediocrity and lack vision and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular almost unbelievable guest guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play drum on of the song this is a joke sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy seems to me to be ashamed of them and to hide and burry them under work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after a thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave cause they are not going to get a to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type indistinguishable from any out take from any album from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going who made the song and who them and will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some good playing by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album and good production buy it and love it

1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon hearing and miss evancho is just goddamn with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word make love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animate being collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
0	sad sad album a an old fan of marilyn mccoo i jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release to my deception the album is a collection of old hit produced like it wa recorded in a lobby of a star hotel they both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though marilyn mccoo still keep her perfect and crystal clear english the highlight of this album is her reedition of bacharahs this girl in love with you there are two extra dowloadable song that only god know how it work to get it if you are a fan of hers you will still get it but do not expect it to be what it used to be i had it because i am still faithfull
0	if one look at review for album they are usually positive even for of the least regarded artist and album i do not know how to account for that it be that in today market most people can preview an album before buy it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back many musical tributary of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr album is in fact i found drudgery to get through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give new a few listens to if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head i will come back to update review if it grows on me

0	i feel like a traitor saying this but i will not be buying this set any time soon i stand second to none in my affection for the band but unfortunately this career spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last year of that recording career by my count there are only about five song on this set that were released after not good enough capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly gathered song and a whole lot lighter on the re re retread
1	one of the best compilation a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope then group like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they also nurture one synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece
1	this is nice turn song from my day of growing up in the and still is a good song
1	great album no track on it that i dislike every one is worth listening to the lyric are interesting the musical style is varied and frankly just sound and it is a nicely long album which i always appreciate worth every penny

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point vane i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor set s never going back to georgia angstrom unit anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych st influenced number wa going mho to be in for a rude awakening banding when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker constitute loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne grouping a a along result the along collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were bear recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history i have always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this collection found thielhelm unmannerly and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown can not get enough audio of you and the read instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe take over may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute can not get enough of you simply horrible adding to their angstrom unit problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating bump to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by wizard alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most ocean focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody angstrom unit crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo gentle just made automobile horn thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo dainty apparently meant to sound like jungle animal batch vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed atomic number it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic can not get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty audio frequency thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous disconnection group vocal i think kaz had the lead on gentle this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and you will know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an filtrate okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about joule mid s elevator music rough and you will get lay a feel big for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland quiet vocally painful and instantly forgettable rhythm section ballad rating constitute star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this conduct kind of free form stuff but to my ear it is basically noise rating star the album wa gentle also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman certainly did not help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j unmannerly andreolli emil thielhelm can not get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j catalogue andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	another overrated band to grace the late night tv airwave they do not have much to back up their late night acclaim though notable song are lacking this album sound like a kid garage arrangement on some home computer
0	the live version is rendering not the version i wanted do not care for all that talking during the song i deleted it
0	wow do not know what happened here usually i have no problem with amazon downloads but this one suck not crisp instead it is got a fuzzy dull quality doe terrible justice to this excellent tune

0	please stop playing block this song a hold music is your goal to get me to hang up
0	unremarkably when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r b you are in for some rare treasure this is not one of those kind of cd the tune are near to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hook this is one collection of lost soul that should have stay lost
1	it is one of my pet son from the
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it is own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection
0	i wanted one pg version the one i bought had too much cussing in it
0	while i am a berlin fan i wanted to go back while listening to these song angstrom unit in the car i should have read closely these are not the original while the are good they are not the same inward time to replace repurchase with the original

0	this is one of badly the worse gospel compilation i have heard this ha nothing to do with gospel it is a mix match of melody poorly played
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean can not get in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses me listen to it not trying to say jewel should stay confined but just because record are lagging a bit doe that mean an artist to tap to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to above i believe some call that particular horizon selling out did jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human point of view jewel seemed be telling u she felt in her heart i know everyones got bill to pay but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy fat record company we have one britney spear we do not need anything resembling anther one i hope jewel find a way to put a bit more in her album i would hate to think jewel feel she need to serve her ego
1	now memory run with this night at a local hotel packed with people and trying to get a drink of course i wa wearing the black dress
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein
1	i really wish they would do more cover this turned into an amazing project for their fan thank you shinedown

1	this is a very pleasant disc to listen to excellent arrangement of many standard each with an excellent combination of voice first class well worhgt adding to your collection
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying she sound like she is trying id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture please do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or else by this artist i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do i am forced give this only one star and that in my opinion is very generous a i do not even think it is worthy of review i only do this to warn my fellow music lover

0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace when her voice leaf you assumably asleep for minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect a the fire in the fireplace fortunately it wa only a cent wasted expenditure there are some good sleep aid recording available but this is not one of them

1	nice album easy to listen to and plain a hit for m morissette would not doubt that because of the sound lyric and time this album wa released itll easily be noted a a
0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canada self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic read departure in style and sound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed constitute more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i swop call the nowhere rock genre i like la singing and la p demonstrates her talent but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening record album note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa play afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it unknowledgeable is music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are at time but rarely adequate you will not be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a stone doll tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of record album lee previous album since they will have nothing to compare it with but if you are somewhat familiar with fag album like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some slick magazine song sample this is no traditional lee aaron
1	nice album easy to listen to and obviously a hit for m morissette would not doubt that because of the sound lyric and time this album wa released itll easily be noted a a
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performance of this song this guy ha a real magic to him his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison he make eye contact with just one and for just a but you can tell that that person is not likely to forget that moment
0	there is a reason this recording is dirt cheap it is a live recording with somebody coughing all through it would think they would have chosen a better performance to try to sell
1	great cd and great serial publication i own all of them steve boalt
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and album i do not know how to account for that it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this positivist group ha a unique sound for refresh our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular ear music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr vertebral column in the late they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is besides unusual to be frank this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this vertebral column album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the record album whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can refresh do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new constitute a few one listens to to the lowest degree see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or auricle stick in my head i will come back to update this review if it grows on me

0	wow i am really disappointed in this i guess i am just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the band sound muddled and uninspired i get the impression they are going through the motion which they are and could really care le anymore what they put out roth sound soooooo bad it is really embarrassing and i am still not excited about the set list it is not that it a bad set list but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore album worth of material a if it never happened and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh would play of a new album they were proud of what they did and dying to show it off there are song on adkot that are just begging to be played live but i am guessing well never hear em shame to put this out and not have cut like big river you and your blue or beat workn on here a terribly retreaded and unoriginal a adkot wa i still enjoyed the release quiet a bit i play it often and it ha some great song to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of day light what a shame i will pa i own about every vh cd that is been released had iii but got rid of it but i will pa on this one i will still listen to the studio cut heck daves last solo wa pretty good but i will pa on the live money grab thank you very much

1	pianoforte k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano constitute concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from pianoforte this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out live virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is constitute a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one carrying into action can imagine why
1	love love bonk love
1	i love this song it is exactly the same a what i had heard from the dvd large quality sound i stored the sound in my amazon cloud

0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said the only come out that ha the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of cd it sound a little thin to me but it the right version at to the lowest degree
1	both song featured on this one were very good the instrumental version were nice addition a well the last track is a mouth segment which is why this is star
1	awesomeness love this song very inspiring and heart felt i could listen to it all day it make my heart so filled with the spirit
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you i would definately recommend this to anyone even if they are not a big fan of classical music
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good a string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the it wa intended to especially during the chorus preview it and judge for yourself
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample very good i enjoy most every song take out carried by the wind when i first get word it seemed disconcertingly familier a if i would get word it before i listened a few more metre and yes i had get word it before it is a reworked version of yannis on consecrated ground from his if i could tell you album i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song but not only that farish also inserted the same clip of child laughing that amethystium u in their song avalon from their odonata album what is up with that unless there is good explanation for this copying the song carried by the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me
1	i do not care what religion she is the music is renown good and i hope her publicity stunt really pay off all those rich celebrity who are in the closet a conservative did not have promotional material the gut to do what she did yesterday she is a strong independent fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for seed more conservative celebrity to just come out already
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day i am not one of those classic chicago fan who detest the stuff in fact chicago is one of my favored album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the initialize and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then spent the next yr releasing several compilation bouncy and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new textile could conveniently be called xxx i comparable a bunch of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of popish number indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted a something restive instead they inexplicably tried to revive the sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base disapproval this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the initialize were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in there could have been another gruelling to say i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and whip of all the attempt failed there is not much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and product is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe function to make weak album comparable xiv and appear not so bad in look back though what chicago need to do what nearly all of their fan would comparable to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both hunt down out of good song idea backbone in the but certainly they must still have the chopper and live to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let u be honest even a bunch of the textile on their early record were not great song but the arrangement were nearly always aggressive and interesting itd be skillful to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or possibly they do not want to which is fine but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation and bouncy album
1	the greatest band no one ha ever heard of ha it again how doe a band get better and better after every album is beyond me happy to call them my favorite band one of the greatest song writer ever
1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured in film i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my love day
0	sum ha no talent they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible if you want something close to decent in indeed the pop punk genre try new found glory the ataris or maybe older blink material this album is made for stupid punk with no newfangled attention decently span that are in the scene for the wrong reason it kill me to see so many people multitude enjoy this trash when there is so much good hood music out there do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band pick up some afi or bad religion to truly understand the real meaning of being punk
1	who rock harder than nickelback i downloaded this song because i listen to it weekly when wwe come on so now i use it a a ringtone for my android phone

1	first of all we have to clear one thing up mean this is her music for those year although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you another thing many people have said that jewel ha sold out i understand their point of view if you are a die hard jewel fan and do not like dance pop or very upbeat music then this cd is not for you i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a well so i wa very very pleased with this cd this cd wa all about fun experimentation dancing and just having a good time so if you love any kind of dance music or pop or most of all a good time this cd is definitey for you my overview of the track stand one of my favorite i love the lyric the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome put together really well run u i love this song it is a sort of sweet love song the lyric remind me a bit of older jewel but the music and the overall song is so new and fresh intuition everyone in the world ha got to know this song love it the french accordian and the urban sound together fit really well love the lyric a well leave the light on woohoo jazzy i love jewel and jazz together it go well remember the song i will not walk away from her album this way this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat find u wow great great lyric i am sure they will touch anyone who ha been in a rocky relationship and is trying to save it really heart felt verse and angst driven chorus fragile heart at first i wasnt feeling this song and wa like err ick but after a couple listens i wa really impressed really cute and simple song reminiscent of i am sensitive from piece of you doin fine another one of my favorite love it it is just about being free having fun and takng chance i love the beat how jewel sound everything great summer anthem become i am not to fond of this my least favorite track on the album i just think it is like every other love song nothing really special and not very catchy in my eye at least haunted the absolute best song ever i love this song it is so cool jewel sings from stalker point of view it is creepy raw and emotional she sound so awesome almost rock and roll totally different from rest of album i love it sweet temptation good song if light and dark can be represented altogether in one song this is it awesome beat good stuff yes u can great dance song i love how she sings it not cheap to buy your dream i am not suprised santana who she wrote this for rejected it he is not cool enough to pull it off go jewel u me love another awesome song reminds me a bit of run u however the lyric are so much better like a girl anthem just listen great beat a well america great message i love controversial jewel even if this wa a she sad a bit of a watered down version i would pay big buck to see what the record label cut get a little repetitive but the awesome lyric save it becoming good song not my favorite though it ha good lyric however not very catchy though well and wow another great piece from jewel she sound great she herself love this album same old jewel writing the mst awesome lyric just different sound she is doing her thing and you are going to love it it is light and dark but catchy and upbeat however like i said before if you are a fan of jewel at all and do not like pop dance music then skip it although i do miss the old jewel a bit that is what the older album are for i appreciate her keen sense of evolution i can not even wait to see what she put out there next buy this buy this buy this you will not regret it

0	all side were wholly scratched and the record would skip every other note
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they were not this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual music i have only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there is really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it is one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole it is really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it is nothing spectacular but it is a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening
1	love this cd a great mix of fun and serious ballad

0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album a very poor impression then but i i would go and take another look some decade later this trio creative to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow i am horny i am stoned listening to this album i can not believe anyone not knowing these were would recognize anything about them despite appearance this review is not about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided far too pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew the in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison not accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of they were about musically a fertile where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest
0	i remember liking this song when it wa yr really stunned at what i heard when i listened to song and her other work available online from that era and since am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune she flat out every few bar she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average overall kind of meh

1	it is hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidate big star radio city get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior come to mind but the frontrunner from the ha got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shine in turn whether it is the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems a a group with no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson i would particularly this album to rock who have considered dipping a toe into the of electronic music but were not sure where to start this is can not miss

0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i did not do my research i give this album a because it ha a couple new track but there are only and most are from his free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which ha track and is a lot better it ha good track flow great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the rd felt release i have only listened to it about time but my first impression were of disappointment one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining there is a ton of talent in this trio but it just doe not mesh in this album

0	a lot turn of people have praised simply this disc but i am not one of them this recording is many thing but the soundtrack it is not despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also written by him this disc ha the song that appeared in the film but not simply one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc because it only delivers a small sample of the film background music and the score is a significant element in any film without the score all this disc doe is deliver along the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you enjoy film simply score then this disc disk is one you should skip

0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mar hotel and have to say that while i am a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old mobile fidelity japan pressed year old copy sound much more natural and is superior in almost every way in fact i panicked and bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful seller a few day later earlier last year mofi wa supposed to re release this album on lp but decided not to at the last minute and friday music picked up the licensing right instead this reissue is not all bad though a i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich throughout the recording and the lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at gram it wa pressed at rti in california and very good quality control standard were obviously taken by the staff that produced this recording
1	great song from a great band that will no doubt call on out many more terrific song in the future so far demon is my favorite song from this group
1	some other another hit
0	this cd ha a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining very depressing her voice crack scrape and she can not quite hit the annotation buy bonnie raitt instead
1	i am not sure a i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiast but herere my thought in the trend of cd re release of classic gospel amazing grace the complete recording offer more than one take on many tune and that is a good thing the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again and since these are live recording the spirit move and move i love aretha especially here her voice and spirit soar and we are taken with them the reverend move u in the way only he can and let me take a moment here to offer a hallelujah and amen for the southern california community choir they are with the leader at every turn and their love for our lord come shining through and that is what a good gospel choir is my friend thank you lord praise jesus

1	love it
0	i never ordered this
1	one of his best and one of the best holy night version of all time done
0	what i simply and always say that when a artist ha to come out with song they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to to make that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her music it actually ha not actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that would make i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d
0	uninspired garbage such a disappointment i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out i could not be more unhappy uninspired is the best way to describe it food waste it seems so half assed when compared to their previous album
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style so far i have had only moderate success hybrid fart that name come to should have been my first clue if we are even talking about a bekker constitute cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love is it or german language perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great non cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker recording i could not find his name anywhere on the cd package granted later i wa horrified by pine tree state the sound emanating from my speaker that i did not look too long before i convinced my self that german language the german word on the front cover along of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker banding ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his splendid sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction on the music struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band associate in nursing all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know angstrom unit of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave saame me the information in a comment breakthrough to my review

1	just like the moving picture
1	what else can i say another gravid album by a gravid artist like another review it different than his last album but just a good all the same i highly recommend this album
1	year is one of my favorite band you can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work while i still prefer autumn effect this album is solid but that is not surprising at all i really do not think year is capable of producing crap medicine their music and the vocal are just choose too good
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal universe the universe of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the yesteryear few year the way that once saw band ostracized from the metal universe for not being unvoiced enough ha finally found a niche of it is own albeit one that is being beaten into the labor by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well charles frederick worth owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly vocal are smooth and hypnotic overall a great album
1	i fell in love this song on ghost ship i had to do some research to actual a is not on the album i am glad i found it it is so pretty and the singer ha a beautiful voice

0	i have a dylan fan from way back and i am a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what ha happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated like this cd is such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these song and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his such rationalization for singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra best i am fool to want you where are you why to change me now and trivialized not recommended for dylan fan and not recommended for sinatra fan

0	i have been a dylan fan from way back and i am also a big sinatra fan fearsome i write linear perspective this review from that perspective what ha happened befall to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin hour angle biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge noesis of sinatra and how he did these francis albert sinatra song and one i am tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra best i am a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not recommended for dylan fan and certainly not recommended sung for sinatra fan

0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no le onto the music the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doe not have any punch everything else is just by the number a band taken such an amazing album and title a it name they just do not even begin to break new do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of dio what a joke
0	this is not the theme from initiative this is the same song where my heart will take me that wa used a the theme for initiative but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the initiative tv set series

1	perfect tense
0	not my case of music
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that it share of vitas upper and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle register track and co written by vitas track and written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy enthusiasm and love music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it is impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of a vitas many performer especially those from distant land is plagued with pirated play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad where is you there is me kuda tuda ya on your dancing shoe do not keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat not dancing this one i dare you short and a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor in this one street of the capital a cheerful bouncy song a hint of that upper register i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in this one just techno sound and the voice a instrument
0	those that have followed grace and the noc this is a disappointment grace is much to talented a songwriter for this this is an artist like picaso doing a paint by number if you liked never going back v song with meaning like apology or big white gate this is for you gone are song with meaning soul truth replaced by techno i m the guitar riff between scott and benny i miss a piano solo like star i miss a rocker like ah mary or the bus the influence of neil young zep steve miller stone and janis are replaced by pop singer yes every artist ha the choice to pursue and every fan ha the buy my prediction will be a nocturnals reunion in the near i waited week to post a review to give it a chance to grow it ha not
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep i have yet to find that version for sale this is not a good substitute in my opinion
1	i absolutely love this song they sound awesome together being a woman angstrom unit with a busy job and a husband with the same this song make complete sense to me
1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old school type soul voice i have heard this year these are all original song too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourite though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hope too high breathe love maybe i am not the man evil woman which i am sure u the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country though this is not acknowledged they do not know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can

1	well good
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd then do not even bother with this album not put out too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of sung puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill bonk their childhood dream of playing in metallica is nervure frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down please for recollective the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original constitute sound trivium
1	first of all we have to clear thing up mean this is music for those year although i am absolutely sure if that is what it mean that the best guess i give you another thing many people have said that jewel ha sold out i understand their point of view if you are a die hard jewel fan and do not like dance or very upbeat music then this cd not for you i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a well i wa very very pleased with this cd this cd wa all about fun experimentation dancing just having a good time so if you love any kind dance music or most of all a good time this cd is definitey for you my overview of the track stand one of my favorite i love the the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome put together really well run u i love this song it is a sort of sweet love song the lyric remind me a bit of older jewel but the music and the song is so new and fresh intuition everyone in the world ha got to know this song love it the french accordian and the urban sound together fit really well love the lyric a well leave the light on woohoo jazzy i love jewel and jazz together it go well remember the song i will not walk away her album this way this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat find u wow great great lyric i am sure they will touch anyone who ha been in a rocky relationship and is trying save it heart felt verse and driven chorus fragile heart at first i wasnt feeling this song and wa like err ick but after a couple listens i wa really impressed really cute and simple song reminiscent of am sensitive from piece of you doin fine another one of my favorite love it is about being free having fun and takng i love the beat how jewel sound everything great summer anthem become i am not fond of this my least favorite track on the album i just think it is like every other love song nothing really not very catchy in my eye at least haunted the absolute best song ever i love this song it is so cool jewel from stalker point of view it is creepy raw and emotional she sound so awesome almost rock and roll totally different from rest of album i love it sweet good song if and dark can be represented altogether in one song this is it awesome beat good stuff yes u can great dance song i love how she sings it not cheap to buy your dream i am not suprised santana who she this rejected it he is not cool enough to pull it off go jewel u me love another awesome song reminds me a bit of run u however the lyric are so much better like a girl anthem just great beat a well america great message i love controversial jewel even if wa a she sad a of a watered down version i would pay big buck to see what the record label cut get a little repetitive the awesome lyric save it good song not my favorite though it ha good lyric however not very catchy though well and wow another great piece from jewel she sound great she herself love this album same old jewel writing the mst awesome lyric just different sound she is doing her thing you are going to love it it is light and dark but and upbeat however like i said before if you are fan of jewel at all and do not like pop dance music then skip it although i do miss the old jewel a bit that is what the older album are for i appreciate her keen sense of evolution i can not even wait to see what she put out there next buy buy this buy this you will not regret it
0	sound quality is so downhearted you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it it is a nice song though
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i get wind it sound like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his novel stuff doe not compare to his first record album
0	unsatisfying
1	either get it or you do not but if you do get it then you will love it unique spacey cosmic trippy technical and melodic it is a great recommended to fan of voivod toxik watchtower rush vector atheist cynic or any other technical prog band
1	it is hard to single grouping out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidate big star radio city comparing get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior come to mind but the frontrunner from the ha got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level metropolis and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed trusted it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track constitute shine in turn whether it is the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems a a group with no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music but were not sure debate lady friend where to start this one is can not miss

1	exceptional album amazing especial video
0	i bought later this album after seeing with child the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i do not agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle like the live performance record album on crossroad and the production quality is not great either you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run through this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great player intersection but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread record album popularity and playing at smaller displace venue
0	this is waste of money only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song i thought it wa actual cd decade because from the mp version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album doe anyone know how to give le than one star james egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that twelvemonth i could not help myself from writing a take over review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not non know that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first time the final you do not know end with a horrible angstrom unit pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer do not throw away your money and if it is on the radio change the station

1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past year than dokken even without george without jeff and a weakened and at time embarrassing don put on this band is still one of give the sack a guess kind no matter the lineup dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release jon levin is incredible never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay levin is that constitute good the first and last song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable don vox are not a strained a on lightning strike again he displace seems to have found a register where by he can still sound smooth of course mark boals batting order in the background doe not hurt but cheating is allowed at this age keep it going don we are still out there
0	i just finished right on downloading from the cloud and there is a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track taster disc track disc track disc track if i well try to open them in window various medium player nothing happens the name doe completely not even appear in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too long window will quiet not even let you rename them in the normal way update reference i have found a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing key out imho for constitute example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy angstrom unit handed and transition a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become in a higher place quite loud to the lowest degree and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to reference be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp disc seems to be quite energy department erratic to finish point out just one glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you like but do not expect to be resolution relaxed and lulled to sleep angstrom unit when it is finished file repair solution a i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the computer take to get to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe that is character right there which leaf number character for the track name now let u consider the name of one of the non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op b one ii andante un poco adagio mp that is character so the total is character well over the character limit window just can not handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation mark that is character shorter than the original file name now the total tacky are under character comfortably so window will all over let you rename the individual file go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given above you will cut out character leaving a total of character register do this for all the track finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new file name from the example above which is character you will see that you end up with a total of character well direction under the character limit of course reference one wonder why did not amazon think about this and think use a reasonable album name and file name without curiosity duplication in the first place my conclusion given that at least four of the track are not relaxing and you will have to spend at least open minute screwing around to fix the file naming error imho this collection just is not worth the trouble even if it is pianoforte free to begin with of course if you are really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for object lesson it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked constitute for them

0	once i would downloaded this song dynasty i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential drop but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song dynasty by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy the title track wa also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song dynasty not a sad one i do think peter could do really intimately if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better cloth to sing
1	i recently went on a a lot tour of angstrom unit hearst castle in banding central california there is a grand dining room where invited hollywood celebrity and others dined in the s s our tour guide told u that he liked tumbling tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song tumbling tumbleweed over and over

0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song the rest is well all filler and the record is only half an hour long so there are only about another five complete song track one is a reminder of maiden s number of the beast and track three is second long it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well piece of advice tape or download the single and spend your money on something else

0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is great a usual but the lyric will lose you there are two song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the rest of the lyric are just hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all erg ay caramba one note samba la la la la bamba or jolly springtime oh the jolly springtime in the merry month of may oh the heavenly hour oh the come again day or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl she is about to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i do not know but i had to listen to this cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about
1	i have listened to this over and over and love it every time it is a sung wonderful song especially for easter thanks
1	oh yes this is one of tjose sung song where if you need a little bit encouragement just pop it on and a the title say just let it go
1	estimable
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music except that it is trim down at the end tragical end for such a mulct piece of music this music is on a par with heilig by schubert sung by the choir of trinity college cambridge these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb however this one is ruined by being trim down short at the end before the music is finished
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an devouring theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen i wa pleasantly surprised from the first listen i felt i could abide by the story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming some of the tune i could not wait to play it again
1	memory of computer memory bygone day
0	paid for it but never download
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be in style so far i have had only moderate success hybrid fart that should have been my first clue if we are even talking about bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if were a few le hard consonant not really the of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all know the vocalist be telling how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker i could not find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that did not look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction the music struck me a st german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review
1	the disc came shortly after i regularise it and ha been very impressive ever since this young british maestro definitely ha this score well under his skin the vienna philharmonic play splendedly especially the adorable ending in the final movement
1	ramsey lewis ha been a favorite of mine for a long metre if you like jazz buy this track and sit back and enjoy
0	buyer i wa given this recording a a gift no enhancement will help it is awful the diction is horrendous the voice is deplorable it a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture i never heard of this performer i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that seller wa duped the person who gave me gift certainly
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen i want
1	tyte trakk
0	i think this is her worst song ever blah she is so talented i can not fathom why she would write such an incipid song wherefore a this
0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting it is terrible ok let u start with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that is undeniably a stone classic in every single sense of the word it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that do not to be more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting then some classic that do not really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and last time really better song than not you hear me knocking moonlight mile let it bleed and all down line and come street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby do not stop over album cut like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career but they should really focus on the golden rather than equal time allowed for these awful cut hell mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choice look know i have a bias i love these boy disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into they are the single rock n roll band of all time but even a major major fan i not recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the i cut my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band it is basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she wa hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the music obviously i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but do not get this album it is not worth the price find a friend who love the stone if you are smart you will have a few and ask them make you a mix get lick used for a couple buck just stay away from this nonsense no rambler the title a gorilla i give up i am going to my room and putting on sticky finger
1	traditional body politic
1	she is mystify singer and she is even better live i wish i could find all of her song live
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could not even get through song before i realized what a collection piercing hired man of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity one of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc the two song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet one might be the only good thing about this disc collection the trade booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait bear a couple of year and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine constitute for dollar lol
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she vitamin e came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod multitude his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally hour angle gone out of fuel her latest album boldly early named red is an atomic number abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with turn an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly poetical disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank record album or more explicitly aging endure backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger make out and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her constitute last deluxe album is called if slight this wa a movie and associate in nursing it turned out to be a eer beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran turn out it wa even worse than i beloved couldve ever imagined how bad well let u just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black atomic number viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young clock age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you comfortably we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day think by i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i did treacherously not like so i wa like we are never ever washington ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever read getting back together musical genre again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the audio rest of her song are the worst i have heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely sung filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e sir thomas more e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth straight off or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad one time bit more mature consist of boring tune simply that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we distinctly listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio clearly we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it did not matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that she is still country her album is not even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to open do everything by use up herself or work with better musician cad her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war later many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing picture and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly engagement not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down seldom and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the washington world is composed of clock much peradventure bigger thing than her
0	wow i wish they stop playing this garbage on the radio by now even for a minute birdcall this guy is just desperate to keep his career going he need to look himself in a mirror cause the euphony flatout suck

0	maroon ha fall in the like of all the other modern day group what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly in high spirit pitched run that all sound exactly alike this may be fine for today young who have no idea what constitutes a song with stay power or true musical value but for u old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice
1	love it
1	very very good
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pas for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
1	reverend
0	ooh an electronica pop christmas song no wait it is another lady gaga song about sex where she turn everything into innuendo guess what the christmas tree is yep at least it wa free and i did not waste any money on it

1	a favorable oldie for sure
0	this film represent exemplifies everything i dislike and try to avoid about hollywood production terrible
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light the sun a nasty burn now is not that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it is just fantastically brilliant
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard she is also one of the most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather short lived person group formed back in the early that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time haunting her song stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just can not imagine why she is not more popular some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance while some of her song make you want to cry she is that good i do not know what else to say write other than buy her music
0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl experimentation album we have not so this is a cd deserving set and load of track but many of them are kind one time of jazz style strange slow singing and empty feeling there were a few pleasant traditional piece but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there if more or le you want to experiment it might be worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this
0	aint nothing like crackheads in love brings back memory doe not it remember when they both dependant up cocaine wa indeed a hell of a drug

1	ahhh that sweet voice of anne murray this lady pours her heart in to all of her song an extremely pleasing voice for your listening pleasure buy it youll be glad you did
1	very felicitous with our purchase and delivery
0	first off i would like to say that i commend gem with nerve wracking something a little different and experimenting with a new phone it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to show an record album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i do not real like this record album a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i do not get former armed force in when i have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they consist of pitiable lyric dodgy music and ridiculous spelling this way is by former armed force gem topper record album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next record album gem is back playing pawn writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out this record album would be a fantastic record album for a young new teeny bopper to show and release but i expect something different from gem something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and gem keep your clothes on it not magnanimous and it not clever you do not need to sell your body to sell show
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and big have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth genuinely is that audio while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to angstrom unit more than once and really once you have gotten to the chorus of solid each song you have pretty bear much heard all of it no fresh refresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doe not help matter much it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it is too multitude bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for generic wine to the highest degree it if you literal do not know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
0	i do not know what version this is but it suck i like another version of this song i had but ii am not gon na keep buying them to find it

0	man i hate capture my leslie townes hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that mightiness be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to start out with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i like before and smooth do not the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the last one but then again how many sentence is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because i am wino it is just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i do not get why some have already said rebound is a dearie of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rebound rebound rebound uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this pep up by wanting to see a rebound car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation matter not to mention the chorus appear to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed to rock me bowl me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doe not seem rectify for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i have not given up leslie townes hope and think jackyl can smooth resile support but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their offset couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there but cobain did not speak to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan that is the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously should not need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let u simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the rest of the band member were also hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan that is three strike nirvana fan yep so i will leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it is not too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out or we are only in it for the money the fug the fug elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bend or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant heartfelt lyric then pick up these album instead leonard cohen song of leonard cohen or song of love and hate wilco summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan highway revisisted freewheelin the time they are a changin blonde on blonde another side of bob dylan or bringin it all back home billy bragg william bloke or talking with the taxman about poetry nick drake pink moon or five leaf left the beatles sgt pepper revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo la tengo i can hear the heart beating a one or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or non traditional sounding vocal then you should listen to these album instead television marquee moon the flaming lip zaireeka yoshimi battle the pink robot or the soft bulletin captain beefheart safe a milk lick my decal off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday lady in satin or song for distingue lover van morrison astral week the pixy surfer rosa morphine cure for pain or yes tom wait rain dog or swordfish trombone jeff buckley grace or sketch for my sweetheart the drunk you simply love a great guitarist then pick up these album instead leo kottke my foot are smiling greenhouse or string guitar robert johnson king of the delta blue volume and jeff beck you had it coming blow by blow or wired dillinger escape plan calculating infinity king crimson in the court of the crimson king or starless and bible black built to spill there is nothing wrong with love or keep it like a secret the jimi hendrix experience are you experienced axis bold a love or electric ladyland the yardbird over under sideways down or having a rave up wes montgomery smoking at the half note or full house you just love well arranged complex moving or eclectic music then pick up these album instead the zombie odyssey and oracle the move shazam charles mingus pithecanthropus erectus mingus ah um or oh yeah broken social scene you forgot it in people mile davis round about midnight steamin cookin sketch of spain or kind of blue art pepper plus eleven or meet the rhythm section love forever change or da capo the byrd notorious byrd brother turn turn turn or younger than yesterday the band the band or music from big pink mahavishnu orchestra inner mounting flame brian eno here come the warm jet or another green world p s if you really desire something profoundly lyrical read some poetry i would suggest theodore roethke t s eliot allen ginsberg or ezra pound to any nirvana listener established or potential or basically to anyone for that matter

0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the ahead of time seventy these were the metre in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm terry kath and simon peter cetera notwithstanding a most fan know the simon peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and ahead of time eighty so one might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although i am sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement he did not contribute a single birdsong robert lead very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or contract to pick up them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms unaccompanied release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent exertion and in many path it appear more chicago than xxx why could not robert have saved some of his material i tocopherol somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mix here but what are they they sure do not seem too chicago and then there are the horn everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy percussion mixing sound of their red hot single mix free just make it seem a if instead of stress to create inspiring euphony a they once did they are stress too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single these guy are talented musician they do not need to leaven themslelves to anybody where is their unity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
0	no plot synopsis or any information about the production include
0	poor sound track these is a very loud drum in the background that distracts from the very good violin music if the mixing wa better this would have been a fantastic track unfortunately i did not hear the drum in the very short sample you hear when buying on amazon

1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song i am for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you will not go wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i can not praise it enough
0	a of this writing many of the track this album are misnumbered mislabled
0	the cd control system get prima hand down the problem is that there are only track although the cd ha track is missing when you download it
0	not really chistmas y just minute of repetitive and tedious listening thankfully it wa free otherwise i would have wanted my money back
0	i did not like this version of this song but since this wa free i guess i should not complain
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the change in instrumentation this album is just a good or what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to and tuba it would not bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked that is what this is they did just slightly switch the sound of the instrument they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instrument keep in mind i hate hipster and went with can only be described a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but doe the lead singer voice sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend disappointing to completely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to pop they should have learned from u
1	after watching the movie secretariat this had to be a part of my
1	both song rendering featured on this one were very good the instrumental version were nice addition a well the last track is a talk segment which is why this is star

1	i do notknow why but i love this song
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the survey here to try to find the best album i do not hold that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly subservient one are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle like the live performance on crossroad and the product quality is not great either you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run through this will go in the heap of cd that i had great desire for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains miss of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue
0	cd no good no refund

1	we another prime of dmb doing what they do best live show this show is special for quite a few reason one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this their last show the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run you were a member of the warehouse you could have gotten both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last release sound issue live in new york this release sound amazing and on a side note i could not really hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the show start with an explosive might die trying a great way to start thing off dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave even bt the second song you can tell this is a special night for the and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a nice surprise for fan that go straight into yet another incredible and like every fan know dave and band always re invent the song there is so much energy in this show it really like you are there in the crowd after the incredible two step dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song end the show with none than the last stop if you are a fan just buy because you know it is good if you are new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy still prove that after year they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what do best and if you lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer i am sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version i am very sorry to that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it about five time and nothing really stand out the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some lyric from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more filler india message just do not resonate with me on this album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin back to the middle video and nature in the future
1	nice mellow song about reminiscing about day gone by what could have been if feeling between two people had been in sync
0	when i first played this cd i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group not sure what this is supposed to mean but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to do not waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else

1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal best track is dig but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback robin thicke pharrell and t i definitly hit the nail on the head with one it reminded me of something you would hear from earth wind and fire i hope these three collaborate again
1	beautiful interpreter voice

1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous pep pill register and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas sing usually in a middle register track and were co written by vitas track and written by him alone total playing meter is i just adore this cd it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it is impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one and only hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from perpetually chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of a vitas like many performer especially those from distant land is chivvy with pirated platter play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad where is you there is me kuda ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoe do not keep silence so loud mythical with some exotic techno sound unlucky a tune that will fix you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat try not dancing to this one and only i dare you in short and a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno smack in this one and only street of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that pep pill register i believe in love with henry sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no word in this one and only just techno sound and the voice a instrument
0	this album just did not do it for me i got it when it came out to the highest degree because i have all their in that location cd and love them to death it is too girly and clock poppy for me high pitched block the lyric are not all that clear and do not mesh well together to mean one thing most of all the melody of the song are hard to listen to you know how some song are just difficult exactly for the ear to enjoy these song are information technology fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling filled song though control secret and sleepwalking get star from me the rest get about star i can not relate to them much and i do not get much pleasure from listening to them but i will always love tbms older stuff and bonk their newer hide and seek album
1	best vocal of that year waiting for the next one

0	the live version is not the version i wanted do not care for all that during the song i deleted it

0	i bought this for my grandparent who requested it not my taste on medicine but it doe remind me of them
1	hear it for yourself
0	not my type music
1	one of the best compilation a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope then group like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they also nurture one synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become unvarnished rock which evolved to the point of hellenic masterpiece
1	nice
0	version suck i accidentally ordered it instead of damien rice i am pissed at wasting no cancelling i guess
0	this wa a gift for a friend i listened to it but loved the music
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and i do know how to account for that it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit attention this group also grab your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band ha lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head i will come back to update this if it grows on me
0	ok relaxation music but it just doe not do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
1	awesome song
1	lyrical and musically talented a breath of fresh air
0	i love dyan this cd came a a shock slow boring uninspired dreadful update i listened to it again it is even worse than i thought his singing is like a parody it is amateurish he would be off the stage at american idol horrible i can not believe he released this
0	i do not know where else to plain about this but every time this song come on i cringe and die a little inside it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and unrivaled of the most annoying song of all time aside from the fact that the song consists of line of lyric with no substance they adopt the can can song and make it even more irritating
0	the song is not the type of song i same the song lack of energy i think it is not fun to sing too
0	i so much wanted to love this album dylan a sinatra he must really believe that he doe not sound bad but it washington painful to listen to the off tonality croaking i love dylan and i have been a fan of frank for a long time the longing and emotion were somewhat evident but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warm up up and i can drive along the ocean with my windowpane open
1	great item just what i needed
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his i have bought and no in case are wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it did not hurt thing though i will get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter that is the bad thing the good thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and them into memorable most of deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that can not move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood is not trying anything new here this is territory that is been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un aside from the excess photography badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it is definitely the album of the moment so to continue on the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time
0	uggg another christmas cd from leann rime vigil you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice it is sad to watch all her project fail frost and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album people put out christmas music when their career are failing leann used to have a great voice and wa a likable talent not anymore i can not understand the practise word she is singing and the album is not very some other good i expend used to be a big fan but she seems so unaware of what she ha done to her career lately too bad career over
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer i have no idea what happened but this a well a many others wa never downloaded and i didnt want to do it again and pay more money for somehing i already paid for
0	i like to download the free vocal and album to find artist that are different within their genre sister hazel is not one
0	sorry but that is ridiculous my opinion
0	stupid
0	not deserving worth the money
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did away not like any of them including this song i guess it wa worth the price
0	we ordered early and waited with bated newfangled breathe but this just interpreter wasnt up to her usual it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger le universal audience it also felt like she had forced the new song they did not flow and the male vocal did not mix with her voice disappointing
1	some other hit
0	i wa a huge winnow of dm album like music for the mass black celebration and violator i also enjoyed people are people some song on broken frame and much of speak and spell but most of this phonograph record never did anything for me it is rare for me to have had a magnetic tape in the that i did not really try to like from band i liked but a few song like lie to me are good a i recall but people are people is a stronger early mode military post speak and spell quality stick with music for the mass violator black celebration people are people and speak and spell
1	i love this cd every undivided song it is one of my all time favorite i feel like a couple of the song are straight out of my life highly recommend
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem think if you are stuck in the early s or bust mentality of fandom then this album is not you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen them mainly because of the lyric this wa third of a strong trilogy of alices album the others being flush the fashion and force all three while they do not match most of his album deliver the hard rock good while drifting away from alices horror favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
1	it is bonk weird and kinda creepy but i love it
0	i remember liking this song when it wa popular yr ago really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era and since am i the only one that mean she absolutely can not stay in line she flat out every few bar she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very intermediate overall form of meh

0	i attended a shop given by the virgin desrosiers back when she first unfreeze this album i washington very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the shop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it is the detail that in truth count when it came to the music i washington disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the unitary laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the language to ramble the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the language provided even so desrosiers determine to substitute a british sailor imbibition song claiming that lauras father washington in truth something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she had not known where he washington no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking

1	this is utterly beautiful especially by harp music
0	i am a vocal man so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean during my era of music it wa pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def leppard pour some sugar on me no college class to figure out what any of those song were about and i guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now

1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this is a existent band using existent instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old school type soul vocalisation i have heard this twelvemonth these are all original song too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is consistently good mind from start to finish i do have favourite though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hope too high breathe love possibly i am not the man vicious woman which i am sure u the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country though this is not acknowledged they do not know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is conjecture to be made and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made rear in the day you will probably love this get a imitate while you can

1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best i have ever heard him do on own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that boot that will no blister and last for many mile of i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo version the shorter are not bad although none of them in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fan overall a recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette

1	this old world of ours sure is changing debauched at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining intelligence program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so debauched that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i do not think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that befall around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the expect out for and enjoy on a day to day basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the harbinger to book and everything else that we currently use to convey and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is advantageously shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speech production before an audience that is in truth enjoying the story and you can near see them wink at each other when something she order hit national to me southern storyteller are the advantageously because the art ha behave on longer and it is still view an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the confederate state that ha fix the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may order it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained any the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tarradiddle of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain overwork to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing lashkar e toiba me order i wa blessed to have have been raised in the confederate state with it great storyteller but for those of you who were not i can think of no better good example of storytelling by a overcome storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july at age his legion of fan simply refused to let go from that point to no le than of his rca single release would make the country chart seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country hit single between and of which crossed over to the hot six to the adult contemporary chart which did not begin until and one to the r b chart never mind the hundred of equally wonderful selection from his many eps and lp all in all however i would say he did a fairly credible job augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and three more photo of jim including one with wife mary at an award ceremony a partial discography of the content is also included but without any chart detail all but track recorded in and included on an early lp were hit for jim of them pop crossover only track made only the country list going to early in his version of the old standard i love you because wa recorded in and wa first released on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country hit a a single note too that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in and released on rca victor going to country hot a the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit represented here and the one that lead off the disc is four wall country for eight week in which wa his initial pop crossover however this came after country hit beginning in with mexican joe for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o ranch boy so i tend to agree with another reviewer who say that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cut to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart both still it is hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum star

1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they were not this leaf a good third or so empty on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual music i have only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are in lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there is really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it is one of those album that is obviously meant be listened to a a whole it is really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it is nothing spectacular but it is a well together album and very easy on the ear a choice you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening

0	i am a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion but seems to have fallen back that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no seems in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the blame around it is been a long time since i heard any album recorded mixed this swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound off it is just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding i am aware live is but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio i am really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a new recording baring no i think this wa just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved i am still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this one aint gon na cut sorry

i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the fight hymn rehash materialize now this eric adam doe not sing lyric it healthy like he is saying them he is the only thing that have on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the skillful vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl mount logan guitar work doe not bother me on this album it is simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of impression one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a dork when i match him all right time to hurt someone impression demaios bass healthy like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it is pretty bad and annoying every song it healthy the same i am dumbfounded over this awful healthy and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly is not the true metal healthy the overall product prompt me of electronic dancing music where they switch channel for an interesting utterer or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doe not is heavy bass gravely if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that mystifying bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you desire to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of prompt me of sign of the zodiac of the mallet album lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could excuse bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this is not at time they remind me of dr sue verse which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to reconstruct the lyric of this album let u take a look at each song the godhead of steel depart off like a dr sue verse but ha musical moment work shy lyric writing poor chess opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the humankind nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are unlike not a bad song but the merge is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why is not eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal music better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it is like an incessant hum of tone and that is a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i refer demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that healthy like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric are not good and vocal music healthy pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a movie fight training montage to backup the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an unbelievable loss of ability in his voice did something happen to his voice that i do not know about el gringo this is a silly song that healthy like a taco bell commercial head for the perimeter annihilation dr sue verse s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal music disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and shoot down for twelvemonth it is time to die punctually noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus healthy like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring berceuse that healthy like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job still if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i did not download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better dance band in the true metal genre i am sure their european live show are dumbfound but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a dance band creates it is own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this dance band is not the same since ross the bos i have a impression he kept demaios ego in line until he could not take it anymore technology ha ruined this dance band they used to be lofty of secure in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to bonk this dance band again he need put aside the ftw i will do what i want attitude or take so backside hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hail and killing blah blah blah but you can not contend with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in twelvemonth he will remake this album too

0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist which i am guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label name just a list of the song and not in the order that they are on the cd i am not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a higher register steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same go for dirty world the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor that is completely missing he doe not miss altogether handle with care make it a a slower tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i would think he rocked but a whole record of this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise i would label this for completists only but i am a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could get back

0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said it wa supposed be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to with is a bunch of filler among a of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a best song on the they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still do not the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be for just because i am drunk it is just a watered down version of of the bottle i do not get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too not right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why stick with them i have not given up and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find again and work out made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask play me nirvana and any natural depression other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being stone a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the and inward just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good pathologic but then in along came nirvana inbound with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest inward sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the stuck in the well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using and so it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an thing to do then the is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the i used to like stain grunge and i went through a period of stain severe depression but in i snuff it took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression ground instantly disappeared i information technology wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all to ditching my virtually grunge cd i do not recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the wish world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide do not poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge
1	i decided to buy this mp download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex non clare he is an interesting person with a unique soulful voice and i figured that this one album would not disappoint this ha been one of the best album that i have ever purchased to date every song is different but exceptional too especially buy hand are clever hummingbird bear u a heart beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat buy with a pop like decide upbeat chorus whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activity there is something no this album cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed i promise

0	when i gave this album star at one time after listening to az then listening to this a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch this album is a bad a it get first off this guy bite off everything in his site the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die just longer the only reason why he is famus is because he got shot time and he is a fool on stereroids he is all over the medium and is an annoyment on mtv and bet anyway on the album his lyric are childish and nursery rhyme along with a lame horrible flow with good beat but putting him on the track made em sound bad he is a million mile away from being pac and ja rule ha a good chance of beating him if you like pop rap odds are you brought it and after reading this review you hate me but for those who like real hip hop understand this is garbage and is doe not even to deserve to be called a rapper from queen na az and mobb deep hold true to the queensbridge name it is not even worth cent itself it doesnt even deserve to be on the shelf interesting fact this fool dissin ja rule yet he is copying jas style i mean he ha a fake gangsta image and club song love song and he acually sings song imitating ja rule and also he used pac rhyme on the hail mary remix from tupacs song hail mary and against all odds to dis ja while using tupacs rhyme for exploitation what a joke a discrace and a cancer to hip hop just like chingy juelz santana he ha good beat but his rhyme are completly senseless ludacris g unit j kwon bow wow and u know who else peace

0	i hate not having a portable mp file i either own the music or i do not i do not bear listen to these tune on my computer
0	the late s there wa a yes inspired band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album but not the league with yes starcastles arrangement were softer le articulate and their lyric were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know star stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in mist but what wa the point i regret to say this but fly from here like starcastle it is yes light i am glad they are still out there working on new but this is simply a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i posse this is for one of two listener either yes completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a great album imo
0	most of these are only portion of the song such a verse and the chorus i would prefer the entire song also many are done with a country feel to them not the traditional music you would hear in church i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to along with and it not a hit wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i tune wa the price

1	phenomenal recording on th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by evans all six selection on the album were written by and he produced it a well jamal play jamal a classic that ha yet to be officially released on it command premium in the collector market and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician i remember when had the track of this back in the that played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doe not come out on cd soon i will get professionally transferred over to the cd format i have done with many out of print vinyl album still unavailable cd this one is overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal play jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horn and string by two the pasture and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill a well my favorite piece the album swahililand is also the longest at almost ten minute and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horn and before he kick in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on conga al ternating from left channel to right jamal finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the de force it is the final track on the album and close it out fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the recording is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that wa beautifully by engineer tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the year and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal play jamal is my favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back cover sound than ever

0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use string for the main line this u brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i do not even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at that is out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling

0	if you are a tango dancer or d j looking for a collection of the most danced atomic number to tango in either the u s or argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it early on contains few if any of neer the the essential golden era hit instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost never want to play at a milonga calling painfully the collection essential tango is misleading at best avoid it
0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with see run and hide it sound like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o yard record album i rated it star because there wa no star all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good exertion to actually make the see or whatever sound a note but it wa still risky if you are wondering this cd wa rid at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the one we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of rid cd

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming flow from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released displace a a seed limited edition x ma single completely for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of turn his smoke torn voice he change all the devotee arrangement of his song during live constitute show because he can doctor of osteopathy no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it placement is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed one at any longer because he hung on too long express mirth like a washed up prize fighter

1	recording quality is not that smashing
0	the only two strain that are worth listening for me are the discotheque strain i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me strain i wa expecting the strain like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens voice started chiming in i do not recall that from the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but i can not recommend this album if your interest trygve lie in more of the movie version of the strain rather than the strain on this cadmium i should have demo the strain before ordering but i do like the discotheque strain that are not available for download

0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there it is a extended dance mix much in the vein of it a sin or can you forgive the glory day when all mix either vinyl or cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best of the remixes
1	this sung is the rest song in the world
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type way of garbage i can not not help but laugh twelvemonth at big how bad this song is when i hear it sound like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first album

1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work but i bought this for simply my kid and it really is an entertaining first rate diverse operating theater introduction one to the endless repertoire of mozart perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music or kid who need memorable tune creation to sustain their interest in classical music or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background

1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound put together of the spanish trumpet often in the lead add together and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening conduct if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with information technology almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a associate in nursing malo album along there ha to be a love song i am for real say it nicely then the angstrom unit hauntingly beautiful flute piece simply midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to instrumentalist the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you will not go appendage wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable angstrom unit i can not praise it enough
1	came out in a this wa the band second lp maybe not masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive at that this garden of delight pressing ha an added bonus song tune i liked best were the title track back my hill stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in the band later reformed with two original member heinz mikus guitar and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change they released several more effort rock lion hard breath and gold n glory check em out

1	i for the first time heard this on pandora so i quickly looked it up on amazon and purchased it this is a great acoustic version of iron bar by stephen marley
0	this cd length singe quietude track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to distance give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is hobo camp shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some inward random point within the next hour information technology now try to relax
1	i wa suprised that this song wa good i wasnt expecting much from an american idol person but this song proved me wrong hopefully the rest of his music is a good a this song
0	ala this washington not the original recording nostalgia aint what it used to be

0	not quite what i expected
1	heard it in a movie and wanted it it wa hard to find on line but amazon had it for a cheap price very happy with this track
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so much of a screechy and the song wa just too depressing about a who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters
0	of the song on the cd are scratched
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beat are horrific probably of the album regard good constitute i do not see why people are raving about this record because it is not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lack greatness compared fuss to other female rapper and being the face of t i s hustle gang she is garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta claim asap rocky cause their both wack
0	sample track sounded great but when you listen to the entire cd it is one monotonous song after another had high hope for this but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune probably will give it away if i can find someone who want it

0	not the unity i wa looking for
0	for a while it appear that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the concluding one swift would even prove her doubter who would lay claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal elbow grease at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of uracil who are singular and promising of how swift will turn a an creative person will be abysmally disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for class old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back in concert the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her concluding deluxe album is foretell if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let uracil just say that it is only remotely better than rebekah dark viral friday but dissimilar rebekah dark she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is alone devoid of any poetic element and dwell of only girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be frankincense oh so i told you the other day i foretell him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i did not like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back in concert again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst i have heard of taylor swift so former armed force the album is alone sate of nauseating bleep like re atomic number atomic number atomic number atomic number d and me atomic number atomic number atomic number atomic number atomic number that go bad along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that dissimilar the concluding couple of album lacked any form of depth or insight that can entreaty to a mature brain frankincense they are no foresightful charming but annoyingly self importance centric that can be characterized a those that came from the back talk of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature dwell of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a darling john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other manly singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is memorialise in a studio apartment we bury the fact that swift is very washy vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the concluding time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it did not matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that she is still country her album is not even good pop perhaps she should think twice before act upon with a bunch of song author for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been rubber and sound with civil warfare many the great unwashed who heard that song doubt that swift had any major writing and they are rationalize in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being self importance centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too a lot of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of a lot enceinte thing than her

0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no le onto the music the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doe not have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just do not even begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke

1	i decided to buy this mp download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare he is an interesting person with a unique soulful voice and i figured that this album would disappoint this been one of the album that i have ever purchased to date every song is different but exceptional too especially hand are clever u a heart beat like base for the rhythm of the and pair this beat with a pop like upbeat chorus whereas up night is a rock anthem to evening there is something no this album cd for every and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed promise
0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and pathetic title to the ridiculous tracklisting it is terrible ok let u start it with the obvious how do gorilla gorilla they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably construct a stone classic in every single sense of the word angstrom unit it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but fingerbreadth it omission here is indefensible that alone would doctor of osteopathy stop me from buying it record album or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that do not deserve to be here more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting then some classic that do not really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and the last time really better song than can not you hear me billet knocking moonlight mile let it bleed and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby do not stop over album cut like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career but they should okay really focus constitute on the golden year rather than equal time allowed for these awful cut hell i mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choice look i know i have gimcrackery a bias i love these doctor of osteopathy boy disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time seed but even a a major major fan i would not recommend this album to anyone interested eve in getting into the stone i cut my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good common sense intro to the band it is basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she wa improving hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is mess around no difference between them john r major bonk star for spread over the music obviously i isidor feinstein stone mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but do not get this album it is not worth the price find a friend who love the stone if you are army of the righteous smart you will have a few and ask them to make you a mix or get lick used for a couple buck just stay away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up i am going to my room and putting on sticky finger
1	i have seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet remarkably dream theater the switch in focus from shredding to melodic phrase long drawn out piece with slight direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a slight samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this english hawthorn be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen i wa pleasantly surprised from the first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming constitute some of the tune i could not wait to angstrom unit play it again

0	wow another album from brmc where they can not decide what kind of music they want to make rocker or slow drawn out and imo dull folk song i really liked war machine aya those i bought and enjoyed i will be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again
1	i do not sham to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i have not yet find out all of her s era release because they are a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her shape subsequent to the s fall into the pop music and light jazz genre i get the mental picture that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to jog her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop music and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an creative person is going to follow her own track obviously but i bid tane san wouldve done an album or two more of uncoiled ahead rock because she is good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first chance because although it ha some minor downside it is akin to a buried pop music rock treasure since there is no cut through listing here i will do a blow by blow kaeshite devote it back start with a strange almost playful poetry take some wonderfully unexpected sophisticate in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything i have find out before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting outspoken attitude the channel here is just acoustic guitar and outspoken over wide eyed percussion section and afterwards some subtle keyboard but here is where tanes unique voice shine through it is difficult for me to explain just why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison hold jumping out at me eventide year after i first find out this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional channel between poetry and chorus there is a satisfy knotted twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that gliding channel then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent channel from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it is outspoken over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily tire the inferno out of me but the outspoken melody in this sung dynasty is naught short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french piano accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if you have spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop music one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely submit to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried recondite in the background but quite is an integral catalyze element of the mix how or why japanese archipelago ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japanese archipelago ha an abundance of recording railroad engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an eventide par with guitar and outspoken but i am really really glad that is the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable sung dynasty and tanes outspoken performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this sung dynasty is the fact that the last three chord of the sung dynasty are a quote of that three chord trope in jimis wind up cry mary whether that is ensuant or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best sung dynasty on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those sung dynasty that is like a heartfelt little journeying or adventure it begin soft a a fledge build and build burst forth in anthemic chorus then after a legal brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the outspoken to end on that same soft a a fledge place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a sung dynasty that is been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great sung dynasty easy one of my all time faves it is unfortunate that the railroad engineer distorted the inferno out of the guitar on the chorus but great sung dynasty no joker start with tanes sly outspoken over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane unfold her cast too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it is not a horrid sung dynasty but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good mode kakekko dash or race is a mellowed channel with a pretty outspoken melody and touch of reverb atmosphere resonant of seated in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there is also an understated acoustic coast solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the choke up she is done since but an excellent relaxed channel daite atomic number hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune high than kage with just outspoken over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the outspoken melody is not a interesting a the rest of the sung dynasty which lead me to believe it is one of those sung dynasty that rest more hard on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most authoritative phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i be intimate you generally in that order and i have not sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the sung dynasty perfectly there are two break into slower pace channel that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the dissipated pace of the rest of the sung dynasty an understated but relentlessly cool tune i am far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop music so although there are a lot of her tune i like from afterwards album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still have not gotten around to getting her other disc if you like alt rock that is generally upbeat quite than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent

0	if you are a big fan trivium style on first two cd then do not even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort give this album two thumb down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium

1	great song i have always liked crow so that is no surprise you would think but believe me i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film super acid pax it wa so dissimilar the many other hit she ha released over the year the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john the evangelist rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were chuck out from the soundtrack it is just the score so search elsewhere for this great song trust me you will not be disappointed

0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to impersonate the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so practically of a screechy sound and the song wa just too lower about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock hymn for womanizer and maneaters

1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find batch of old lyric from his tape sabbatical and rather composing borrowing melody dylan pas the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he been making his own record since the s rather he other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a early costello producer burnett claim the record conceived and recorded on a tight schedule something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the married dylan at time dylan basement tape could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those are not successfully assayed in my because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each these very dramatic singer some of the better track on the record is obviously a marvelous talent choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

0	i became quite a rooter of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be standardized in style so far i have had only moderate success hybrid fart that name should have been my first clew if we are even talking about a bekker cd everything is in high german which would be fine if it were a few le hard agreeable not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or high german i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker recording i could not find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrify by the sound emanating from my speaker that i did not look too long before i convinced my self that the high german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i believe mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the opposite counseling the music struck me a st century high german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough premix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are secrete by each band all memorialise are a magnificent journeying on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker standardized to s e please please lead me the selective information in a input to my review

1	you know i am just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the difference from original to remastered i will say paying or or for this seven albulm set is tremendous i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fan i became aware during the born in the usa tour then purchased all the previous cassette so in the last year cassette were lost and or became obsolete now i am able to purchase all seven for what amount to each that is a win right there and like a number of people i the first seven springsteen be the best sans a couple of live album so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with
0	thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software i wa trying to figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection of doing so or ever heard of the artist very generic song no redeeming quality for me sound like just about everything else out there
0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen very good song but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kid are very talented and great musician however i thought the song writing wa bad the lyric bad and the vocal were bad vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own signature and personality into them not just read them off the sheet of paper she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent remember her janis joplin cover turtle blue that is what i am talking about she need to do more of that this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd somebody need to help them with their songwriting it wa all over the place on this cd i am hoping they can turn it around but for now i am backing off for a while to see where they go from here good luck you guy
1	great
0	i could not download this i tried multiple time and reading all of the help info did not help very foiled
0	boring
0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting it is terrible ok let u start it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a stone classic in every single sense of the word it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that do not deserve to be here more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting then some classic that do not really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and the last time really better song than can not you hear me knocking moonlight mile let it bleed and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby do not stop over album cut like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career but they should really focus on the golden year rather than equal time allowed for these awful cut hell i mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choice look i know i have a bias i love these boy disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time but even a a major major fan i would not recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone i cut my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band it is basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she wa hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the music obviously i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but do not get this album it is not worth the price find a friend who love the stone if you are smart you will have a few and ask them to make you a mix or get lick used for a couple buck just stay away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up i am going to my room and putting on sticky finger
0	the book think grow rich is a must own it is book to be read multiple time that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone doe not pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second the narrator ha a strong voice it is just emotionless it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so can go back to day bottomline buy the book buy the audio book skip this one
0	the remaster is terrible like so much music remastered these mean solar day for mp player it is completely oversaturated so that the voice is compressed and distorted and there is almost no dynamic range the voice file look like a brick this type of remaster is what give digital voice a bad name and make people long for vinyl it is dead possible to make a great digital remaster but this is not one of them boo

1	this is some great playing here the tone and rhythm are perfect this is excellent to play study along with perfect tense the actual etude i am giving it a star because i do not like how he interprets constitute some of the music i know this music is difficult and there are many way to interpret it however some part just have to sound right
0	most of the music start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a jazzy type sound which doe not do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep course the sample that are do not let you know that worst i have spent may seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window amazon can do that with it is own money i will not purchase another music from them
0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because is not well done the transition are terrible of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who seemed to sell million of record were in bad taste musically this cd take that to a whole other level
1	i am very happy with this cd

1	here is another release from a band that had been dormant for year so here is the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while there is some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all work organically to achieve some scary result the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience you will ever come across the song are lengthy and repetitious and that is what make them effective while it is hard to classify this opus it is safe to say that it is a doom metal album there is a lot of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and you will find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best album of so far
0	this wa the clean version i want all my music they way the artist fail intended with f bomb
0	i am sure ha other good cd but i have not found it yet
0	the problem with getting the preview is that they never let you hear the end of song i do not know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album but several of the song have the last note or two cut off either completely or right in the middle of a note lot of joy there i will say that there are some song on the album that are fine but getting slammed like that really ruin everything i will probably go through the album again and remove these song my

0	drill boring
0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into that affect the performance of the day artist ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a if that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this idiotic since it make all the much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along a dozen mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable number slot it not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording

0	i generally wish starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video spunky parody and novelty music a far a those prime go the artist have not deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just are not a unique comical or alert aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem wish a nice touch but i felt wish it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a apt insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to plunk for egoraptor whose video spunky review on youtube i love bought i can not really recommend this album other than
0	the immense majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice scott mckenzies san francisco be sure to wear some flower in your hair is one of the better quality song marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hayseed and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous boiler suit this promise more than it delivers

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the and just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the stuck in the well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an thing to do then the is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i do not recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide do not poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge
0	i enjoy music that tell a story the tone is moving and very enjoyable what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the word that are sung hopefully artist the future could follow example where music could be music again
1	this music reminds me of the early album of gary numan mostly because of the instrumentation used i like the science fabrication theme and robby garner vocal prodigy ha become one of my favorite and i really like control
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history i have always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown can not get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute can not get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic can not get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and you will know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and you will get a feel for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ear it is basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman certainly did not help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm can not get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

1	this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric interesting production and musicianship it blur the genre of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence for fan of progressive emotional and electronic music this is album is for you check adam at
0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are saying the production value are terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining in fact i am pretty sure they recorded it on a year old and mic set up using sound mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version secondly the message is stupid they do not really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band about this album wa a waste of time this is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on cover there is no way the music wa going to sell this album
0	i love this album but this get star it would be great if wizard one time i would get a record from amazon that did not skip at all last two i have purchased have had bad skipping spot

0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other creative person music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is bring in a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is not well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a mo clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slip of non talented performer who appear to sell million of immortalize were in bad taste musically this cd take that to a whole other level
0	too excessively expensive

1	lin manual miranda is an outstanding composer he is a remarkable man making history on the stage history a his inspiration and a musical form that allows much information in the shortest time
0	horrible sings his nose and steal all of his guitar lick others do not bother with this one
0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain point neer really take off the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doe not go anywhere with it the theme neer develop and the variation are not all that different from each other i had high hope for the finale a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future put to work may go in some new direction nonetheless
1	what can i say a massively favorite song to get the favorite recording of this i had to purchase instead of use amazon streaming but lead my mellowing out playlist it also is that song from the famous volvo split commercial

0	i am disappointed in this version of the song i can not understand the watchword at all the isaac bashevis singer are not louder than the accompaniment so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the watchword especially in a christmas carol there is a bell that is lightly ding in the background and that is pretty
0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash he lack the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe

0	i moldiness have ordered this by mistake because i do not remember it wa i supposed to download it or what i would like my money back please
0	what i simply and always say is that when a artist ha to come out with a song they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her music it actually ha not actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d
1	i have hundred of xmas different am a dylan fan read all the review here wanted to add i love this cd i agree with all the detail in the star review will not repeat them but what stand out is pine tree state the sincerity classic feel of the arrangement here it is warm glowing like a warm completely fireplace dylan raspy voice add the spice crackling of the log for me this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra world health organization manilow or bing unlike other big name star who make the obvious xmas collection dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over over definitely a washington keeper from left field to center stage

1	i do not know why this song wasnt a bigger hit it ha always been one of my favorite it is very evocative
0	though i will take some responsibility i from itunes should could have the sample my bad how can they use the same name a an already existing band and produce music like this while using that name really it should be an outrage i am stuck with stupid music that i for oh well i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness hopefully it will not come up in random very often
0	this cd is impenetrable duty sad if you are a heroin addict this cd may cheer you up i only liked one song on the cd and i am a lucinda fan this is not a feel good cd
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let u hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy

0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented clyster in many different aspect he wa creative and every one time i listened to his other show i laughed so hard i had to stop constitute the recording before i choked his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field this album is not creative nor funny it is constitute just hateful mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop fireman and snitch are a well a fart and enema joke go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy because you will not find it privation here

0	i yawned i really yawned
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song the is with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the bring other groupie song to mind such a what is name what really this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view what the road do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doe not help matter much it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it is too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you do not know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
0	stupid song
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band unlike most third wave ska band they have a clear clean sound they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal this is not similar to early ska or the two tone era ska it is too peppy and energetic this album is good clean fun i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese there is only one song completely in english most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english the only downside is that the album is only minute long

1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on one is that we will die some other is that motorhead is blend to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound mystify and purely unflawed on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still peach powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great lay and this doe not change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cross of the rolling stone fellow feeling for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cross but holy crap doe motorhead off this song i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doe not try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of stark solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is somewhat much stark and this band take a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

1	honestly i wa never a huge fan of this song the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song one of pine tree state his bonk favorite he think it is really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might hear very often from bear my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine bear day i have always known well the lyric were romantic but they have more meaning for me now also this digitally prove remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version his voice doe not bother me now just go to show how important recording quality really is
0	ha that garage grunge band just one of plus holiday mp s i have collected and forgettable nice cover though
0	not happy with this one do not know if it wa my fault or not but after the download the song disappeared into the bowel of my computer and i ease can not find it
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately and not for her music it ha been for her work with american idol and for her spousal relationship to marc anthony ending in a off key split but for her latest single she want to try and recapture whom she wa a vocalizer before and fails to do it on papi the third single from her album love the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her life history in fact hearing it now feel like a weak kitten than a striking and firm tiger good luck to jennifer on her other externalise but love wasnt really feeling the love at all with the exception of on the floor song d
1	i listen to this cd every day day i absolutely love this group i get inspired and motivated feel good music by family group that really sing
1	the shock is ease wearing off about dolores oriordans passing my daughter wa devastated when i told her the news she incessantly wanted to see the band live and this song it wa both our favorite cranberry song the song haunted my dream the night she passed my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang she wa obviously proud of her inheritance and never tried to enshroud her accent in her song and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound if you have never heard a cranberry record this is probably the unitary to introduce yourself to their sound
1	love this corney song i play for anyones birthday
0	wow what a load of garbage if you watch the movie the music might make sense a a stand alone experience without the visual side to accompany it the album is an epic fail the cellist dave eggar might be accomplished and all but that doe not really come across on this album and if you are a fan of amy lee or evanescence there is nothing to see here amys vocal appear on maybe of the whopping minute the album play for the one song amy wrote for the album push the button is easily the effort worst track sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot behind the dj in ibiza it is completely out of place on the album a a whole stay clear of this piece of crap
1	i have seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	the used cd came from library by the lake and wa exactly a discribed it wa in perfect condition and arrived quickly without damage the life action singer produce great music and this cd is one of their best
0	i wa a huge fan of dm album like music for the mass black celebration and violator i also enjoyed people are people some song on broken frame and much of speak and spell but most of this record pine tree state never did anything for me it is rare for me to have had a tape in the that i did not really try solid to like from band i liked but a sung few song enchantment like lie to me are bear good a i recall but people are people is a stronger early mode post speak and spell choice stick with music for the mass violator black celebration people are people and speak and spell
0	the song is listed a keep on smiling but non it not what you get when you download it thats suck there is nothing i can do
0	lousy alternative of song
1	this fabric is grammy award material
0	there wa only one song i wa ripped off i felt cheated bonk amazon please let customer know how many song are on a cd
0	this is the excessively lowest form of music it is take heed following a predictable and waning formula i have listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me i have listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpet to entertain me
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic and even catchy hook the fuzzy and droning vocal best track is dig but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape
1	if are an adopted child who feel that empty in your heart or someone who want to understand then listen to this song
0	but this grease one palm album is horrible only one fairly decent song on the entire cd do not buy it you are wasting your hard earn money on this

0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time and one of my favorite artist a well so i wa so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song but i wa horribly disappointed when i newfangled heard this song i really expected better from her than this in the past i would have angstrom unit bought a shania cd without bothering to preview it first because i well knew that it would be really good if not excellent when shania finally release bear her next cd i will definitely preview constitute it first and if it is a bad a today is your day i may not even bother buying it
0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim after i came across it while looking for another music title i remember hearing other similar flowing water creek soundtrack and thought that this would be similar but wa disappointed i thought that this recording seemed and so fake a if made by a synthesizer or in a bathroom the track also seemed to be a second recording on a continuous loop like you i base my purchase decision on the experience of others if you liked my review or felt that it wa helpful to you then please let me know by clicking yes below i would also replicate be happy to answer any question that you may have about this product thanks my review are delight real and typically based one on week of actual product usage my opinion are not live copied from other review brook and simply are from my own personal experience

1	recording quality non is not that great
0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in their early day when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever possessed ha long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalist of the were bad nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than try harder he doe not even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public
1	what can i say the world is just ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid original unique i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl then i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me you cherri denniss hit i love finally he put out his first self titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did get the recognition it desereved but the world just wasnt ready now my fav underated artist producer is back with his second album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first one on this album is more laid back and taking thing slow i am in love with the infectious sunday night i am also glad he put awesome resuce you which is only on the bonus cd your not my girl a funky moderate track that take you back to the olskool zodiac is another groovy track overall this album it totally different than the first one but a a loyal fan i am gon na say get the album anyway support this talented man next selection

1	uplifting song
1	nice product would advocate this seller
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it is going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i do not view this a a foster v rubin thing so this is not a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i do not feel that he is done that and yet at the same time i think he is charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when i would rather have left it alone i am aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this is not happening sadly it is the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and can not face listening to some of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn i am expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doe not flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it is trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss the mark i can not face giving this one star because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i can not cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it is staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that i am probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it is only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
1	love this angstrom unit song it is very catchy and very cute this whole album is such a wonderful find my infant son and i really have enjoyed every song but this is one of our top
0	listening to this cd all the way through wa neither easy enjoyable if you like beat driven pop with repetitious lyrical hook you might like if are expecting to be touched by another excellent jewel collection prepare to have heart broken this cd truly disappointed everyone i know who ha it is pure pop drivel

0	love this song but wa very disappointed in how soft the background vocal are hard to achieve a good blend
0	buyer beware i wa given this recording a a gift no enhancement will help it is awful the diction is horrendous the voice is deplorable it is a pity that the aria and sung dynasty are subjected to such a fell distortion i never heard of this performer i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped the person who gave me this gift certainly wa
0	this is a rather strange compilation the person track have little in common other than that they were made for movie this is a mix of single channel and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal it contains somewhat new music a well a some very old music the audio choice is quite a good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track this mixed bag ha very little going for it it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner it would have been far better a a assembling of music from early film or of more recent film a it is it is a hodge podge that i really can not recommend to anyone
1	such a great tune and could listen to it all day blake clean version is just a good make all redneck proud
0	no metal behind this cd
0	paul taylor music is not the same a i his earlier cd the music is not a great a it wa before

1	doe anyone medicine remember larry gowan fan vocalist do this collection of song span his early career with all the best music gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter never one for ballad his music is quite original and thought angstrom unit provoking this album doe have a few song plague that would be considered ballad i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit since gowan is still performing now with the band styx never the le it is his early year i remember with fondness this album is the best of gowan
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song that is what this song totally ride on at least chris brown even though it is a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better lyric nice video altogether i just do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in second i will never forget you you are in everything i do later just like a tattoo i will always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe you will get some attention star end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who is not afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and that is a b i g but copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stand out
1	evidently obviously a classic
0	bwb is a great collaboration but this album dropped the ball every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any genre the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work i am not sure what intent for that wa but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through not this
1	another stellar album from the awesome jenny beautiful finely crafter all the way through
1	great cd
0	doe a inflicted hole in the head make one better musician i thought so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music it would not have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a whole wa detrimental most music is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it is that is how easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi bob and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he been anointed by his fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted she spoke the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could both move people to and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at could kurt cobain honesty do any those thing no when getting music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop and any form of metal especially for younger getting into the music if you read and what else is there to choose from i think the you have given in to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so that there is nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his bit album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to take him a mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to carry emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he could not match his stagecoach presence or personality i guess his first two cd did not sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a finis ditch effort to attempt to plough him into a middle aged justin bieber we do not want another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have mislay the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can sprain the emotion out of a good ballad
1	album is a great example of jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the and while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big incarnation woody brought a pretty decent band along a well even though he wa entering the last decade of his life amazing guy amazing version of fiesta starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle shrieking trumpet a nifty tiberi solo and good a a you will find anywhere

0	it bother me that the name final stage in line is used here i call up seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard do devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to pardon but it bother me ronnie went to his weighty despise vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no le onto the euphony the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his deficiency of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doe not have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just do not regular begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just by and large disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke

1	this is awesome i pop this cd in around thanksgiving and it basically play until january josh did an outstanding job i love his version of the classic christmas song especially little drummer boy every track is great in my opinion however i am not to keen on the first noel mainly because i am not a fan of faith hill voice and i am not convinced that their voice harmonize well together again that is just my opinion i would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone i love it so much and i hope many others will also
0	i am not normally a fan of remixes and in this case there is no exclusion if you have not bought the archetype onerepublic album dreaming out loud that ha this song on it you are missing out i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started but there is no reason for taking credit for someone el song i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound mix of the song could easily have been left out i very much prefer the archetype mix to this variant
0	i pine tree state wish le she would have covered lesser known song by obscure to the mass songwriter turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one and come on taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest who advised you
1	these remixes are slammin you will dance and laugh outloud warning this stuff is explicit headphone at work and in public are reccommended jonny mcgovern is genious the remix of do not fall in have it away with a homo demand his already riotous totally barry white inspired slow jam and made it a dance club classic determine it out you must

1	just another one of those snappy tune that make me want to move i love this tune and hope you will exactly try it out
0	if you are a tango dancer or d j looking for a collection of the most danced to tango in either the u s or argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hit instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost never want to play at a milonga calling the collection essential tango is misleading at best avoid it

0	i need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you look up the word music class brass professional newmarket and newmarket medicine you will see chicago anyone who know me know that chicago is and ha right on been my favourite group since dirt hand down the only other band closer one is the beatles i own every album and every cd twice my key doctor of osteopathy chain say chicago my refrigerator and front door ha chicago magnet inside and out anything with the chicago logo on it get saved need more proof of my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i did not say anything when this group started re issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue i figured they earned hired man the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vibrant part of the music scene it departed is not easy to stay current for year and please everyone when the new guy came on the scene you did not hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera wa gone stop jeff wa in and that rainwater is that i did ra not ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath and frankly i did not want them to even the drummer tris imboden wa musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but washington folk twelvemonth this is not right chicago ha more talent than this part of me want very hard to salute non them for being there for year the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to stand in a cold inward seattle rain to hear them one play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day chicago and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago i do not know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know warm up my mom said that if i did not have anything nice to say then i should not say anything but i am not getting a warm threshold fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and can not wait and so to tell a friend i may have read to pull the shade and bolt the door and turn off the telephone thank goodness i have other chicago album to listen to better luck next time fella maybe there sir thomas more wa just too exactly many cook in the kitchen
0	i heard a distribute about this chick mark cline like she wa purportedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i wa curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift i think that a song compiling would be enough and trust me it wa enough the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated mark is also quite ugly and can not carry a tune after you are done burning this album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou joel harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artist like shania twain taylor swift carie underwood dixie chick gretchen mount wilson reba mcentire and sugarland

0	not what i wa looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definition and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature so the star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking also i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantra when they are present and accurately read are music enough

1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out it wa really good but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artist i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than the original which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track
1	i have of xmas am a dylan fan read all the review here wanted to add i this cd i agree with all the detail in the star review will not repeat them but what stand out is the sincerity classic feel of the arrangement here it is glowing like a warm fireplace raspy add the spice crackling of the log for me this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra manilow or bing unlike other big name star who the obvious xmas collection dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over over a keeper from left field to center stage

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford john jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of write solely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the manufacturer think so if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg horn james matchack keyboard john jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar james byron dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar john jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum king john brockman drum and listen to the outspoken of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox john jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr john jay demarcus the manufacturer of this album allegedly by chicago extra musician and song writer were necessary to do the speculate that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing john jay demarcus himself hour angle played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am beaming he had some fun but i wa not pay to hear him and his other friend he shout to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too a lot to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or forged i wanted to listen to chicago i do not mind if i do not like the song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the manufacturer and moneyman of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can confidence to write and record it own music only a name to milk river a they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do withal mean to offend that faithless manufacturer john jay demarcus who hour angle made an art of second rater and lack of vision and hour angle offended the band by showing clearly that a their manufacturer he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he hour angle not let keith play on at least of the song and he hour angle not let tris play drum on of the song this is a joke not trusted how mr demarcus can say he is lofty of the boy he seems to me to be ashamed of them and favor to hide and burry them under the function of others if he wa lofty of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to roll in the hay for decade should have known better after a thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave keister cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the common type ballad indistinguishable from any out accept from any of the album from to write and perform in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a band that victimised to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to solely avoide this album and save your belly a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a brace of nice piece here that you power enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find various piece here that you will enjoy very a lot worth purchase for periodic listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to manage who made the song and who played them and you will totally roll in the hay the whole of this album which is more of the same it hour angle some good playing by some people just the class of song you enjoyed on those other album and good yield buy it and roll in the hay it

1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to eer elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his i have bought and no in case you are wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it did not hurt thing though i will get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song one i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter that is the bad thing the good thing is greenwood simply voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to hera love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when angstrom unit their heart get all fluttery at least from little a trusted man perspective rock that you can not move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here prove take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a practise ever lee greenwood is not trying slight anything new here this is territory that is constitute been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is record album un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album territorial dominion is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it is definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood anguish stronger than time

0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just studio music laid out in a completely predictive dannys voice doe not help matter much it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it is too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you do not know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or williams to get the real deal

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good cover up lot with a livewire athletic impresario up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock probably a great bar lot when they started out i saw them double in their early day when i wa a teenager who did not attention that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the lot unfortunately any vocal talent he ever possessed ha long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalist of the were bad nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan drop off their limited vocal appeal a they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than try harder he doe not even try to get the lyric or his verbiage rectify lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever seek even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public

1	so very good he my favorite singer i did not have to wait for the entire album to out april
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a very poor impression then but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity i am horny i am stoned seriously listening to this album i can not believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review is not about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply would not accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest
1	eff it
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing back in when jewel did it wa a big deal everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair this disc while different is just not what i would call jewel at her best i found america somewhat enjoyable and run u wa also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me i did give her a second chance and recently bought her cd goodbye and i must say it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next it will fit her voice well

0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd i wa so impressed the last of year watching these kid grow and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen good song but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kid are very talented and great musician however i thought the song writing wa bad the lyric bad and the vocal were bad vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own and personality into them not just read them off the sheet of paper she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent remember her janis joplin cover blue that is what i am talking about she need to do more of that this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd somebody need to help them with their songwriting it wa all over the place on this cd i am hoping they can turn it around but for now i am backing off a while to see where they go from good luck you guy
0	another balcony sacrifice they should be ashamed of themselves
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam tank literal music in the past ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd the great thing is he did not try to conform to some of hour angle the newer antic with his sound he just stayed true to himself in which literal i can appreciate for the block lady tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u lol

1	mc flepp roman flepp from liricas analas rap in romansh sursilvan and graubnden swiss german i am not a romansh speaker i will say i am a student of german so i find it really cool whenever i can make out small bit of the swiss german i think romansh is a very lovely musical language very pleasing to the ear and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue beat are planned really well flepp ha a voice that imho is perfect for his music and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility he go through a lot of different style from mellow to jazzy very refreshing guest include liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoon on musica
1	first class excellent
1	i enjoyed the euphony however would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd
1	country continues to good turn out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach adkins baritone is a hone fit for this amazing song which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier who lost their life in various war this is a poignant and important recording and is cordially recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric

1	this is grammy award cloth
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued remasters including nine inch nail of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the sake consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch album to album on his ipod note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice wrapped digipak case with truly album art in fold the cover have the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my ear had started to hurt after the sixth i to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range to my dismay i saw lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that album music wise is absolutely fantastic not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the will intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume level turned up the point of over compression and distortion drum in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there
1	satisfied
0	nothing wrong with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in wrongfulness like year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac dc ha the same inhabit setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to convert get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc they still perform well epoch but hearing the same song curing over and over on every boxet hit package or live album get boring

0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate and his voice is nothing special his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous i would have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune a waste of money
1	i have this on an lp tape and finally found it here the entire collection is great fun with the monster singing their own song
1	excellent
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you someone wa going to yell in your ear at some point within the next hour now try to relax
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i did not do my research i give this album a because it ha a couple new track but there are only constitute and most are from his free mixtape rate of flow you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which ha track and is a lot better it ha output good track flow great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released this ep well to make some type of profit off of drake popularity
1	great tune
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song one of mjs best song he did
0	first of all i admire and respect alvin and am sorrowed at his passing this album wa not one of his best the guitar work is weak and the song are very disjointed
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect it is better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i did not give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen to when you are awake but are not a a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those song others are great i loved the price on this and it wa definitely worth it
0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on bruce lee the road and this album is one of his first recording after batch his schooling the brilliance of his tone is there but his in time idea have not yet been fully developed angstrom unit plus cliff jordan playing the senior side man carry through on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether a a maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee wa to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the estimation expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here two star
0	ok skeptical a i wa i gave it try for long i can stand it and after two semester of daily listening while studying this music ha done nothing for me
0	no banjo i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound i loved mumfords first album and thought the second one wa just a good if not better i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out but after listening to it three time end to end i felt bored after the first week i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it and made no effort to retrieve it i hold out hope that the group make a th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific
1	my second favorite r b album of the year right behind anti from riri this wa a grower at first off but it is bumpin flash around the house now it wa hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all i sustain playing wa welcome to my world we in this bitch hold on another great hip hop an r b tracc for u best of me fan an elevator the rest of the album is great like team you coolin smoove jones afta incandescence show outro but one man woman is weak

1	jeff williams second outing a composer for rwby is a home run he creates wonderful euphony that take your blood pumping and your head bobbing personal favorite track are shine and caffeine but they are all great track that is just a awesome a rwby itself
0	audio man i hate seem getting my hope up only one time to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the simply materiel wasnt worth producing well direction to begin with there is a bunch of rallying filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best rallying song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the hoopla listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still do not the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final affair one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because i am drunk it is just a watered social occasion down version of secret of the bottle i do not get why some have already said rally is a read favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga audio really wa constitute this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year doctor of osteopathy old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and over again it sound out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or sole jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doe not seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i information technology have not given up hope rallying and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure pine tree state are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

0	nothing new here except the packaging this collection is the first time inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album that is why god made the radio the reason i highlight single is because what the heck is a single these day although there wa actually a rpm sole vinyl single issued of that is why god made the radio it wa just issued only for some other probably collector like me the other new single is not it time only exists on the album back in the day of top radio we called these album track not single included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibration come on guy is information technology not it time that a stereo mix officially come out spotlight most beach boy song were recorded on state of the art for those time constitute recording equipment also included include are several more audio should record album be stereo mono track do it again surfin safari i get around the little girl i once knew help me rhonda fun fun fun and of course good vibration unexplicably missing is their first hit surfin various plus many strike of their biggest hit like be true to wish your school and inward of put down course their holiday season hit also included are some non hit album track listenning to the mono track most sound like early cd tinny and bassy and are definitely not remixed i do not think that brian would ever have okd these without at least re eqing them on the plus side included are black white photo of the beach boy in their younger day pre gray fat and bald each disc come in it is own sleeve disc their young day and disc the old fart there is also a nice booklet which could audio easily fit in a jewel case both cd look like mid s swirl label capitol s the sound is great and doe offer many of their best in that location song
0	i do not normally give a poor review i am more likely to lean toward average or better the product is fine play well no issue at all the problem i have is that i did not get it for over hour i think today you should be able to purchase a song on line and be able to play it then and there i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting i will not buy music from amazon anymore but i will still buy everything else

1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of absolute angel is that in my book little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they of thing beyond their scope of experience not that want an album of tune about pony rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when barely kid the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel that in my book little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they of thing beyond their scope of experience not that i would want an album of pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context than discussion of her animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
1	what can i say the creation is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid archetype and unique i have been a fan since day unmatched when i heard dependence on the radio receiver following diamond girl then i wa too outdone when i learned he produced acacia farnesiana me you cherri denniss hit i love you finally he put out his first ego titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved but the creation just wasnt ready now my fav underated artist producer is back with his second album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first unmatched on this album ryan is more laid back and taking thing slow down i am in love with the infectious dominicus night i am also glad he put awesome resuce you which is only on the bonus cd your not my girl is a funky moderate track that take you back to the olskool zodiac is another not bad track overall this album it totally different than the first unmatched but a a loyal fan i am gon na say get the album anyways and support this talented man next selection

0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism the animal third album the first beeing the animal and the second animal track i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job i have heard so far the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track a complete failure repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try thank god i have the original on tape in stereo
1	the relived
0	vocal music love this song but wa very disappointed in how soft the background vocal are hard to achieve a good blend
0	oh please whomever keep saying pearl washington jam is better than nirvana need to let up pearl jam is worse than nirvana yet i despise both they both sold out vedder gladly obliged to be a medium puppet and kurt knew what he wa getting into when he signed with a major yet kurt still did not care to fufill what wa asked of him he had always been get under one skin lazy and nevermind reflects that it well is pure pop rock on par with bon jovi and he refused to admit it completely there is no punk sensibility to it at all
1	there are really only few thing in we can count on one that will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the song are a a ever and out all the light contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doe not change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we the grand finale a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil very many band could pull off a cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song i wa smiling from ear to lemmy doe not try to mimic jagger but put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band need a the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up
0	this ha to be a joke next he will duet with william hung at least the profit go to quiet charity still just donate to charity and keep this garbage away from your ear
0	is a reason recording is dirt cheap it is a live recording with somebody coughing all through it you would think they would have chosen a better performance to try to sell
0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time but still neither is enough to let me sit through song of depression loneliness pining cry in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note but your failed unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river i can not recommend this not even a background dinner music bring back the happy swingin cool seth please
0	i bought this song hoping that this version also included the verse a well a the refrain sadly it is only the refrain my mom used to sing this song around house and i had searched for a long time for a recording with word the listen ability on amazon give a bit of the refrain but i purchased it anyway with great hope ok it wa only cent so no harm done but it would been nice to have heard the tune of the verse i found the in a museum in valdes a few year back found the verse again online at a website i know a verse exists

0	this is only relevant for the vinyl version this is about the piece of plastic itself not the music i am a very big panic fan once i saw brendon tweeted about this i preordered it i received it on the day of the release april all good only today i got to listen to it it is all just a tiny bit too high pitched playing it in sync next to a digital version of the same song you can hear it and even without first time i played it and i swear i watched this thing like a hawk and cared for it like it wa my child there is a lot of jumping in victorious and do not threaten me with a good time
0	i would rate this cd a just ok for the money there are better sounding version out there this ha the uk mix which sound flat and lifeless it ha bonus track ironically from the u lp which are already on the album a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like i will get you baby it is you i give it star out of a possible
1	artist all the time do remake of some of classic sometimes they take on song that shoe are too big to fill so to speak but in this instance chris did it justice and then some
1	beautiful medicine music
1	album of the year i love every song my only complaint is that the album is short so quality over quantity is definitely the case here
0	not what wa looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definition and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done is best for first time listening of this great literature so the star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking also i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantra when they are and accurately read are music enough
0	dear sir or madam i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd however it moldiness be good to use the right half of our brain which is usually not used

1	doe anyone remember larry gowan fan do this collection of span his early career with all the best music gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter never one for ballad his music is quite original and thought provoking this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit since gowan is still performing now with the band styx the it is his early year i remember with fondness this album is the best of gowan
0	maroon ha joined the like of all the other early one modern day group what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike this may be fine for today youth who have no idea what constitutes a stone song with staying power or true musical value but for u old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with along his spot on the voice
1	computer storage of bygone day

1	this is the rest song in the world
0	no one no more need evil
0	did order this
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax
0	you would think that this is the exact same track from the paperman short but you would be wrong it is miss the electric guitar that come in at during the actual video meaning it is have in mind to be present around the mark for the mp for me this omission ruin the entire track disappointed
1	country continues to turn out song barytone with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier warfare who lost their life in various war this is a poignant and important recording and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful formatting lyric
0	zorro is ok the constitute rest is quirky but poor
0	it is totaly amazing that this wa created what make sindel think that horrid classical march bear will sound better when played very badly i might add on electric guitar the tone he u are more annoying then a cat fight classic under your bedroom window this is totaly unlistenable garbage that ha no merrit whatsoever this might well be the worst cd i have ever bought i hope this will be no more the total extent of sindels musical offering putrid

1	very sexy sang froid
1	song i grew up sung with
0	it is a secure song but nicky minaj is featured i do not like the way she sings
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound music here is throughout the cd and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it pretty simple if you are big fan of the movie you will highly enjoy this sound track if like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie you will also like this soundtrack strongly recommended
0	i love the album but skip this loud over the top obnoxiously sung song every time it is definitely something bad bad for my ear
1	great sung dynasty
1	this should be an international anthem for the million who resist the to or the answer to the life long question where do i match in leave it to los lobos to put this worrisome question to a foot pink celebration ala zydeco blue all i can say is bon temp roule
1	my year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable channel music station it is now a frequent player he here is dozen of song a day but this one wa a sticky one
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off i finish understand it wa a daunting past task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the dance hall end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave track such a take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla away sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost basically all of u just about
0	i love this album but this get star it would be great if one time i would get a phonograph record from amazon that did not skip at all last two i have purchased have had bad skipping spot
1	they got better with get on
1	fine product
0	most of these are only portion of the song verse and the chorus i would the entire song also many are done with a country feel to them not traditional music you would hear in church i downloaded it have senior citizen to sing along with it is not a hit wa i downloaded it from amazon though a i tune wa time the price
0	to much vocal music and noise
0	i have a vynil copy of that album and will not buy the cd cause there are much better option to waste money zipper is a strange album of an artist that wa a great star during the early mid but during the disco and the new wave turned to be irrelevant his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experience to make a come back but he had to wait few more year zipper reminds u sometimes the classic alice of love it to death school out etc but it is far from being on the same level
0	started out very identical slow just could not feel it
1	this album is skunk wasnt really a fan of j cole until his last album this album will have me purchasing all of his album from now on fantabulous lyric production is outstanding definitely one of the year best hip hop release
1	great song
1	tremendous
0	i wa big disappointed by this album bluntly it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single then stop searching for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul i heard killing time on a community channel on cable it wa being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction
1	i have got to admit i have had this cd since it first came out i am just writing a review now better late than never i give the cd is star yes it is a mellow cd but it is awesome just like paul stanley kiss solo cd my personal favorite wa the most mellow of the four his song i feel were the stongest just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song the vocal and the playing is top notch paul is a master craftsman of song he always writes the best music then put his songcrafting ability to it definatly a star cd this is paul stanley at his best rock on
1	what else can i say another great album by a great artist like another review it different than his finale album but just a good all the same i highly recommend this album
1	an enjoyable mix of cuisine cultural mix and personal transformation loved it
0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they dry run saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart studio tape that everyone already ha and is not that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then one they got real bummed neer when they information technology heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape clock and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is wherefore killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one sung should expect for rough mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted to love them but overall i do not i do prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and inward not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who are proscribed seriously into engineering seem survey to have problem with the different sound of the drum true statement it is nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely indeed the gem here much better quality than try i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a coalesce time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it is that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a tacky dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book hour angle both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff non on it like most of it literal all of disc one and part of jumpy disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the angstrom unit dvd which again ha been available a rag a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe clock for and the dvd for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best live demonstrate this demonstrate is special for quite a a few reason one being only one of a few band to trifle the historic wrigley field and this being their last demonstrate of the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run if you were a member of the warehouse you could have gotten both night anyways this demonstrate is incredible for those who complain about the last release sound issue live in new york this release sound astound and on a side remark i could not actually hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the demonstrate originate with an explosive you mightiness die try on a great way to originate thing off dave then slip in the always marvelous stay or leave of absence and even bt the second song you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a nice surprise for the fan that go straight into a yet another incredible and corresponding every fan know dave and the band always re invent the song there is so much energy in this demonstrate it actually feel corresponding you are there in the crowd after the incredible two step dave surprise a yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the demonstrate with none other than the last stop if you are a fan just buy because you know it is good if you are new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy still shew that after year they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if you are lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer i am sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

0	it would be nice if i could put this song on my player but it is locked in the stupid cloud and i can not get to it i am buying future song from itunes
1	this is a unusual a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement mag tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pas the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue duty tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical comedy omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively betimes costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting quislingism and making no restriction on which singer could take on which lyric costello ha compose immense number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a substantially a anyone perhaps could so what attracted him to the project my best speculation is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement mag tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker jargon quite a a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite a different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those are not successfully essay in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the play of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no weigh each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better dog on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even fathom a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement mag tape fashion the record fathom nothing like the original basement mag tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement mag tape in a truly luxurious mark which hopefully will result in a more well off retreat for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year
1	good song
1	he is my favorite
1	johnny cash plenty said
1	i enjoyed the music however would prefer to be to purchase a cd rather than just a download would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd

1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song it got so low at time i could not really make out the note but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well done really enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and the old beatles song if i fell in love with you very listenable and very relaxing

1	very good
1	i do not imagine mozart purist would want a ingathering that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various turn but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining first grade diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background
1	i like messianic music so this wa a kickshaw for me many paul wilbur work but others a well

1	the history of this song is very intense if you listen to the constitute lyric also the singing voice are very well in tune
0	worse song ever with all spirit of her success and talent and this is what she creates get a life
0	i bought this because it popped up a an ad on a youtube video of the song but it wasnt the same version a in the video i deleted it
0	while i love the cd it would not play on our cd player for some reason i tried it on my son player and it worked the reason i wanted it wa so we could go to sleep listening to it maybe it wa a problem with how it wa pressed i do not know disappointed
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he could not match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cd did not sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we do not need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad
1	it is a very fun song encourages you to keep your head up and enjoy life you will turn out fine
1	fascinatingly unique lin manuel ha created something that unequalled changed music i can not stop listening to this album because every time virtually i listen to it i learn more about not only the music but about race issue and history can not recommend it highly enough

0	j walsh said what i thought about this person album with child huey lewis and the guess news were a great pop rock new wave sounding band they did more blue in the past now they are trying their take on soul this is not the huey lewis and the news we all love huey please try to do another rock album before retiring i think you can still do it
1	this music console relaxes and soothes i am anxiously awaiting the next damien escobar cd
0	see jewel cross over from her folk country root to pop laced with beat and keyboard this album to ignite and feel labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a affair i think that she will look back on this one with regret
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their mind
1	easy and fast
0	where is non the banjo where is the awesome make me live music there is not one song on this album that compare to sung anything or exactly any one song you have done in the past whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong do what you love not what other people want this is definitely not what i expected i just got this today on your release day and could not skip through it fast enough very disappointed

1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha constitute finally found a niche of it is own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground richly by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding in the end of their root to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not constitute for everyone a the screaming turn can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection
0	i wa hoping for something better than this i have reading all the rave review and wondering if amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest my first impression wa sale of the string must be down time to over use it again i love love love vai i do not love story light i can not even give a coherent explanation why at this point i made it through the first listen and wa thankful i only spent the money on the download tone is his playing is still out of this world i have loved him his quirky composing since flex able this one is a miss though there are some high point they quickly come and stay there most of the time i will not waste our time giving you a song song review buy and judge for yourself

0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull spiritual both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas album they knew what constitute would work and what would not and made their musical selection accordingly you will notice that buffett never once touch sole the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but big name produce big fear and so we have this piece of information technology musical garbage along a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doe not dylan use up have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogation angstrom unit angstrom unit but record album it could be against the geneva convention

1	this is a great album no dubiety the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard fade to black is an absolute classic maybe missing a little ball though in this one
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material tag is hydrargyrum weak and the equalise lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star he wa never constitute that his tour forte wa his funny wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally information technology even though he could not match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cd did not sell enough to satisfy his label and their indeed stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we do not need another shallow electronica lyric poem pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad
1	best song ever

1	this worship my personally wa awesome
0	let chaff me say first spill the bean i am a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is great a usual but the lyric will simply lose you there are two song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and goose egg maybe you and i again the bear rest of the lyric are just lanthanum hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all erg ay guff caramba one note samba la la la la bamba or jolly any longer springtime oh the jolly springtime in the merry month of may oh the heavenly hour oh the come again day or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl she is lyric poem about to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple ecumenical storytelling anymore i do not know but i had to listen to this cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about
1	great sung song
0	bob dylan should know better he no longer ha a voice moral of the story do not get old and think you can still sing this also applies to harry nilson paul mccartney etc

0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in the business wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some a again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doe not necessarily take any more credit for their success than ra songwriting but sometimes it is what a producer will not let the artist do that is just a important ya know
1	i have to admit that i have it off very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for president kennedy it is even above that silent night one that wa re covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone i have it off how majestic and happy glee must be to have become an intact link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior through song
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end an ad not worth the dl

1	first came out in a this wa the band second lp peradventure not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this garden of delight pressing hour angle an added bonus song tune i liked best were the title track back on my pitcher mound stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original member heinz mikus guitar vocal and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a yoke of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a variety they released several more effort rock lion hard breath and gold n glory check em out

1	i will make this brief a usual tha animatrix dvd is what turned me onto anime it is also a slight bit disturbing but you know a well a i do that u st century human need to be disturbed once in a while i always loved the music from the dvd so decided why not get the soundtrack and i did what i did not expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie in musical term there is only one track on this cd that i do not like and that is saying a lot it is an interesting journey through a synthetic world via trance and techno beat check it out you will not be disappointed

1	thank you belinda for recording this song it is fun upbeat and showcase belindas vocal talent just downloaded yesterday and have listened to the song about time make you feel good and it is so wonderful to have belinda put out another great pop hit a
0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this away work the problem record album come when you are looking for something constitute else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i virtually would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to quiet the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed to top it off the theme included in this album are dull and flat
0	nothing wrong with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet hit package or live album get boring
0	it hurt listen to the lp version this should be erased from existence the song is not available in the itunes store only the uk itunes store
1	for my role player mp player
1	anything that patti labelle sings can not be bad i loved this song when she and michael mcdonald first enter it on separate coast and i still love it wonderful album maryg
1	beautiful song idolise worship worship worship amen
0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song are great but the remastering wa entirely pointless
0	i am a huge manowar fan since i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm i have seen the band live probably time both in the u and in europe and have met them personally on occasion it pain me to say it but this album is horrid yes the production is poor but that is not the main problem the song themselves would not have made any of teh previous album i liked god of war this is the first manowar album i have heard and i have heard them all many time that lay totally flat sound bad and doe not have a single song that i find worthy i would not expect many or any of these track to make it to a live show i am still a fan of the band i always will be but i need to call it what it is horrid
0	i actually like instrumentals but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration also all of the song did not download with the album that wa the stallion most disappointing maybe next time

1	since i grew up in an extremely remote set off of alaska i may be peerless of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee euphony in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely night from a coalesce album of my raise and i had no idea who the creative person were in my twenty i ventured out into the macrocosm and heard stayin alive and other disco music hit without really remunerative much attention in my thirty i had dinner at my raise house and subsequently they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gee album this is where i came in of course i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa blown aside by the most unequaled pose and thrilling voice i would ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that wa his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible pawn that wa his voice obviously the huge album from the seventy did not interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i supervise to get hold of his solo album i have often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he had not been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the pop song after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album come the closest to proving that just listen to do not cry lone if you do not believe me and while many of the track are once again pop they are more mature both in lyric and in vocal and i love that he u his terrific range from peerless song to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely but so well of course if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you are going to buy this album if you are simply a euphony lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to peerless of if not the most unequaled haunting and penetrating voice in pop euphony history this album is a wondrous creation to the joy that is robin gibbs voice
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer i have no idea what happened but this a well a many others wa never downloaded and i didnt want to do it and pay more money for somehing i already paid for

1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instrument and lead vocalist ha one of most authentic old school type soul voice i have heard this year these are all original song too the music is very gospel though far from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourite though including the opener never leave you hope too breathe love maybe i am not the man evil woman which i am sure u the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the though this is not acknowledged they do not know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i would never have heard of them if not a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can
1	a beautiful song a hymn of earlier day and who better to do it than fernando ortega the one star review really should not be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose but rather an accident on someone part this deserves star
0	i bought this song hoping that this version also admit the verse a well a the refrain sadly it is only the refrain my mom used to sing this song around the house and i had search for a long time for a recording with word the listen ability on amazon only give a burn of the refrain but i purchased it anyway with great bob hope ok it wa only cent so no harm done but it would have been nice to have take heed the tune of the verse i found the word in a museum in valdes alaska a few year back found the verse again online at a lyric website so i know a verse exists
0	not the version i knew or wanted did not know that before purchase wa not given possibility to see that it wa a different version did not say remix when purchased
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a non recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and laugh at others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist which i am guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label name just a list of the song and not in the order that they are on the cd i am not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a higher spread over register steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the information technology same go vertebral column for dirty world the sort wilburys hallmark wa saame an easygoing humor that is completely missing he doe not miss altogether handle with care make it a a saame slower tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without fake benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i vertebral column would think he rocked but a whole record of this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise i would label this earmark for completists only but i am a wilburys completist and this is i wish laugh at threnody i could get back
1	this song is awesome
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r b you are in for some rare treasure this is not one of those kind of cd the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hook this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost
1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best live show this show is special for quite a few reason one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run if you were a member of the warehouse you could have gotten both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last release sound issue live in new york this release sound amazing and on a side note i could not really hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the show start with an explosive you might die trying a great way to start thing off dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a nice surprise for the fan that go straight into yet another incredible and like every fan know dave and the band always re invent the song there is so much energy in this show it really feel like you are there in the crowd after the incredible two step dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop if you are a fan just buy because you know it is good if you are new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy still prove that after year they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if you are lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer i am sure itll be the concert of a lifetime
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music except that it is cut at the end tragic end for such a fine piece of music this music is on a par with heilig by schubert sung by the choir of trinity college cambridge these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb however this one is ruined by being cut short at the end before the music is finished
0	most probable not the song you remember check the preview first
1	if your a fratellis fan like pine tree state me you will love this album
0	the absolutely worst song ever made if you like screaming through the song then you will love it me i like some melody and rhythm and not a bunch of aaaaaa eeeeaaaaaaa
0	did not like this record album totally hated la llave de mi corazon it sounded like the song you would hear on a burger king commercial why add the english lyric there is no penury for it i am totally disappointed and deleting from my ipod get all of his previous material because it is really world class
0	i enjoy music that in reality clearly tell a story the tone is moving and very enjoyable what i liked the best is that you can over again actually understand the word that are sung hopefully artist in the future could follow example where music could be music again
1	i always have first heard it when it came out this time i corrupt it s a gift for someone else
0	honestly this album is really disappointing i will say to you just go back to alaska and explore your genuinely root again take care

0	did not order do not know practise why it is showing up on my account
0	this version is the live of dream on and not the studio version even so a great song but it would have been nice if it said it wa the live version
0	i really wanted to like this album a i angstrom unit bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy struggle and preachy the best song india ha goose egg done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some good lyric from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never more or le build the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler india message just do not resonate with me on this album attempt she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly monotone positive hopefully she exactly will make more sung classic like brown skin back to the chat up along middle video and nature in the future
1	this is one of my favorite old school constitute christmas song this is a classic
1	this cd is hilarious i admit there are some song that are not really funny eer but there always or bad song on an album in this one the bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a lord day constitute really bad song also if you are easily offended by swearing raciest remark do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny so if parkland you are so devoted to indeed you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
0	do not care if it your birthday or not the song is awful she need to be banned from radio completely hide your wallet so you can make her go away
0	i for some reason not like this song at all i find it very annoying how do i delete this song off my play list lol
0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place if your expecting to hear sledding the violin and banjo like i wa you will be very disappointed food waste at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is washington starting to go bad i did not want to west hear another piece of pop billet garbage like their last album i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor girl you have the talent so please get back to your root gary w hill
1	little and ashley harmonize very well in this recording the lyric bring vision of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bell who doe not like sleigh bell i like it

1	i am in love with one this
1	beautiful music
0	i bought this because it popped up a an ad on a youtube video of the song but it wasnt the same version a in the video i delete it
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album doctor of osteopathy it made a very poor impression then but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks originative unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive one drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly constitute from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt outflow form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger tonal pattern after vertebral column all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold baptismal font in most song i wouldve expected sir thomas more the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray especial vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of ghost the virtually song this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting washington melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity i am horny i am stoned seriously listening to this album i can not believe complex body part anyone not to the highest degree knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about inward them despite appearance this review is not font about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided operating theater far too much pleasure for me humbled a a young man virtually and still do to regard them attractively with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is boozy that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a constitute focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew feeble out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply would not accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something well wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling require blindly through the forest
1	pretty good album love the option to download and get cd for almost the same price

0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out year old mobile fidelity copy of from the mar hotel and have to say that while i am a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old mobile fidelity pressed old copy sound much more natural and is superior in almost every way in fact i and bought a used mint copy amazon from a wonderful a day later earlier last year mofi wa supposed to re release this album on lp but decided not to at the last minute and friday music picked up the licensing right instead this reissue is not all a i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich the recording and the is indeed a very quiet pressing at gram it pressed at rti in california and very good quality control standard were obviously taken by the staff that produced recording
1	first class excellent
1	i love hawaiian music i used to own two hawaiian along cd but never really liked them this cd is incredible and i will always listen to the song when i am on the beach

0	while the package art is nice i think that is about the best part of this disc the best song are at the end of the disc and the new vocalist is o k but not a jon anderson most of the song on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous i have listened to this about a dozen time thinking it would grow on me but i just do not enjoy it
1	this concept and music dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever the music is phenominal who would have expected le and the live nerveless acoustic and cd dvd package is an off chapeau the chart idea in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way

0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave track such a take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable

1	love this song
0	ken vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping year old who run around screaming kenny are full of it this album is anything but what i expected from prove the band if you want a real starting line sound drop by my house sometime constitute and i will show you some tape i have of them playing local show around here you know before they sucked ok so they do not suck but they were record album ancestry far better one before they released this cd stay underground with song like gregs last day and the original leaving good starting line unlike this album
0	thought the song would pick up but it doe not non we were looking for something a little more dramatic but it is kind of bland
0	take care gem cross over from her folk country root to pop laced with heavy beat and keyboard this album give out to ignite and feel labored and intense whereas gem excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love gem but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappoint affair overall i think that she will look back on this one with regret
1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured bear in film i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my day

0	shit
0	this song becomes more and more depressing a metre go along so i deleted it
0	to begin i not to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the sheer sound each song along resembles up and coming artist from the late would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel to be reflecting the not neccessairly the word of so called economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording out there that this dry hollow and flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come with this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	completely different than any of her older album if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit this is not the all album for you
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on washington the old chicago kind of like the one miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago and with their intense musical and political statement and then and mega wimpy commercial hit chicago too is no longer relevant bind like they were in the and such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and verify fire and that besides they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they and so would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their top retirement year one with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some hit from this minute estimate pop song for the ipod are the name of the game academic degree today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the trough guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i will not hold my breath a bequest this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too measure bad

0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into bet that affect the performance of the day no creative person should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial derivative control condition a if that washington the creative person last christian bible on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but dainty live and studio recording even a touch for a vision of a work net ball me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog bark and child call if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wishing to be an indirect attestator at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to omit out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that flow of time exceptio probat regulam it can bump that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the record album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force washington recorded by davis in the circumstance of a gross schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis bet all the repetition in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something altogether different he washington alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repetition down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inwardly of the work acquire deeper mean because climax are not repeated but make their point in the blossom forth of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recording but i think i have serve that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording prompt up a considerable count of slot it is not top class a defined by the definitive recording of krips b ouml hm and scepter berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the record album you are mull over at the moment is the studio recording
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could even get through song before i realized a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc the two song done on dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple year and you can get a used copy played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollar lol

1	there are really only a thing in life we can count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all light contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doe not change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doe not try to mimic jagger but instead put his own snarling spin the vocal while phil play a couple of solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist have not deviated from one their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just are not a unique comical or lively aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem like a constitute nice touch but i non felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous constitute song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game review on youtube i love bought i can not really non recommend this album mettlesome angstrom unit otherwise
1	album of the class

0	i had to pay to listen to this sung dynasty even tho i am a prime member and it is prime music
1	i have seen it completely written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to freshen melody along long drawn out piece with little direction to tight bear well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows stargaze on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	critic have called this the best soul album ever they are right this is the best non greatest hit soul album one can buy outstanding singing precision farm make this a can not miss album the album look like a greatest hit box with ghetto child one of a kind love affair how could i let you get away i will be around and others the first cut through just can not get you out of my mind get you going and you will not be able to spell it off

0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not this is a reason to listen to work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed to top it the theme included in this album are dull and flat

0	i have to say that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for low budget movie i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell every single efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact is always the same latinada like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for cry out loud the only one that is good and the only reason i gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad besides the fact that hired estefano work with her i wa expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her star paulina but no i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there and also i agree with the one who that she need to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam tank music in the past affair barn ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really pine tree state matured with this cd the inwardly great thing is he did not try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate for the lady tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u lol

0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind twelvemonth of like the miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago and with their intense later musical and political statement and dolphinfish then and mega wimpy commercial hit chicago departed virtually is no longer relevant like they were in the and such a shame it is also sad they sold out constitute once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band breathing spell wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this matter to moldy proscribed drek i also think that wea constitute now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain globe they will get some hit from this minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple of comfortably exception like feel degree already gone better if record album there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do mouldy this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i will not hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it is one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
1	love it
0	you will love it if you like transsexual rapping
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens voice started chiming in i do not recall that from the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd i should have demoed the song before ordering but i do like the disco song that are not available for download

0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they bob dylan put out christmas album they knew what would work and what would not and made their musical record album selection accordingly you will notice that buffett never once simply touch the religious piece restriction bonk and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is bear left of his voice but big name produce big constitute fear eer and so we have this piece of musical garbage a many have noted the only piece that moderate work at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doe not dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention

1	here is another release from a band that had been dormant for year so here is the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while there is some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all work organically to achieve some scary result the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut which make monotheist of the heaviest experience you will ever come across the song are lengthy and repetitious and that is what make them effective while it is hard to classify this opus it is safe to say that it is a doom metal album there is a lot of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and you will find something new by each listen vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great album i give respect to frost for a masterpiece one of the best album so far
0	i do not know if it is amazon fault but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp is bad too much treble muddy in the midrange and the bass is lacking or maybe it is just overshadowed by the treble listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ear literally not figuratively hurt i am so thankful for program like audacity sound manipulation program so i can balance it out myself but i should not have to
1	excellent work of art she is on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative bad girl image some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question this is a top quality production

1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind fire this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone young and old get up a move
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song dated late eighty former ninety production hour angle not dated too well this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and colewort were at da top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio

0	only one song on a cd music wonderful i wa looking for more music at that price offering cd should be full unsatisfying very disappointing
0	see jewel cross over folk country root to pop laced with heavy and keyboard this fails to ignite and feel labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing affair overall i think that she will look back on this one with regret
1	it is unmatchable of my favorite son from the
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by big the incessant release of live album and dvd omit a well a very disappointing flavor album i believed thunder pestering in the sky could have been a turning tool around point but flavor then the battle hymn rehash happened now this constitute eric adam doe not sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from sung angstrom unit the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar brand work doe not bother me on genuinely this album it is simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing play like pitiful he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong boom point of brand this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a dead on target slide to play the note it is pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly angstrom unit is not the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doe not is heavy bass seriously wish if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the okay picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left constitute to amon constitute amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a unremitting well please constitute unsatisfying use up soth is an awesome album and this is not at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to parole construct the lyric of this album let u take a look at each song the lord of steel sunk start off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song cristal to an album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these get under one skin lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like live warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that inward are flavor different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why is not eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it is like an incessant hum of tone and that is a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric are not good and vocal sound pro vocal music tooled this song could have been attempt very good expendable a pathetic sad disengage attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that matter to will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen americium to his voice that i do not know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial head billet for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal taper disgraceful hail kill and die now anguish that they have hailed and killed for year it is time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff vocal music is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of omit steel a boring lullaby that sound like something convert kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i did not download it for free glitz before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band angstrom unit in the true metal genre i am sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates it is own studio the music suffers much like have metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept ghastly demaios ego in line until he could constitute not take it atomic number anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want sung to love this band again he need put aside the ftw i will do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you can not argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced banding maybe in year he will remake this album too
1	okay i bought this for one jesus savior it a great song and i love the message behind it my family just sigh i pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it they know no matter the season that song will be played haha

0	they information technology used to be cool every song on this album sound the same non this record could not be more boring and redundant they should drop an n because there is no point in listening to it it blow do not buy this
1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very queer to the bee gee music in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely dark from a mix record album of my parent and i had no idea who the creative person were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much aid in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and later they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gee record album this is where i occur in naturally i stayed to watch and almost now i wa blown away by the most unique amazing and inebriate vocalisation i would ever heard in my life from that import on i bought every bee gee record album available simply and solely to unmasking myself to robin gibbs vocalisation and what a rewarding travel that wa his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next record album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his vocalisation obviously the huge record album from the seventy did not interest me much despite their genius danceability because his vocalisation is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo record album i have often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his vocalisation if he had not been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the toss off song after all his vocalisation could easily have embraced any style or genre this record album come the closest to proving that just take heed to do not rallying cry alone if you do not trust me and while many of the track are once again toss off they are more mature both in lyric and in vocal and i love that he atomic number his terrific range from one song to the next i specially love it when he sings in the lower register chancel since he doe it so rarely but so well naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you are going to buy this record album if you are simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to unmasking yourself to one of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating vocalisation in popular music history this record album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs vocalisation
1	i fell in love with this song on ghost ship i had to do some research to find the actual song a it is not touch on the album but i am glad i found it it is so pretty doctor of osteopathy and the singer ha a beautiful voice
0	it wa a cassette useless
1	love love love this vocal
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a alternatively the album offer perhaps air more pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like from hz legend with it is multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something you would hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first after a few listens it grew on me so light her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read somewhere this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at point but hold from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song you would think air would produce with it is western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it is fun but also differentiation on all front it could done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey that is something will probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather sound if you have ever seen air live would know what i am talking about they seem to produce some funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if you have heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what i have mention so far with regard to lyrical absence i have always been to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the sound like two turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce probably the album most chill out number with it is swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung what we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so in it delivery there is just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the a refreshing feel if you are going to get into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on album the song is a good break from ambient instrumental driven latter half of album with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further you can tell it to everybody awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal have this a it is little sister acoustic and laid back in it is approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it is distorted harmonica interlude it is bound sooth whatever sorrow you are experiencing and take you to a calmer african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on album with it is hand picked guitar segment and it is line horn melody it is a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you to the last note a great way to close love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but i am not ruing out higher score it is definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who is been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released i would say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of more chill out tune on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole new market denomination listener all corner of the music globe give it a go and not give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
0	be warned she start creative pose iscreative i first had star but start to two lol

0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling the brilliance of his tone is there but his idea have not yet been fully developed plus cliff jordan playing the senior side man on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether a a maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee wa to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here two star
0	wa a gift for my daughter for so i can not review this item
1	it doe not disappoint at all not even a little bit i am set about to believe that hozier can do no wrong brilliant
1	terry kath in his flower jamming over a funky vamp before transitioning into bobby lamms bluesy ballad loud raw and improvisational gibson s g handiwork make this tune my favorite early chicago piece of work circa

0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are saying the production value are terrible i could have done a better line with a s channel parallel mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining in fact i am pretty sure they recorded it on a year old webcam and mic set up utilize sound commingle emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version secondly the message is stupid they do not really have anything worthwhile to read and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band about this album wa a waste of time this is why they ask to put a picture of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover there is no way the music wa going to sell this album
0	it downloaded twice i called for credit they told me they had issued the credit but when i went to use my account again i notice i had not been issued the credit for this item

0	honestly i hate this song i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it it is another in a long name of those annoying kiss hymn i respect them and really like some of their stuff ace wa a bos but this is just campy
0	this is the overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun toe tapping fun in the and just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the stuck in the well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using it an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an thing do then the is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the i used to like grunge and i through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i do not recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang it cause depression and suicide do not poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge
0	this is non not mine
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd i have always liked dj shadow and wa interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now in it is typical shadow ambiance and found sound but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like a few track attempt a dubstep feel but it come across a plodding a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern those actually sound the coolest the part that make me absolutely dislike the album even though part are ok is the rapper in the rap track that state that trump ha sex with his youngest daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wan na lose half of your audience moby just did the same i am selling all his cd now a he mouthed off too about trump
1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and produce the such anybody who angstrom unit ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he drove release you will never get a part ii to any nin album because from the bear on beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature ghost however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape rather than an album reliant on verse touch chorus bridge structure the mission wa indeed successful ghost present beautiful piano passage soothing swarm of saturated noise and harsh electronic beat a perfect recipe to form poetize the soundtrack to daydream which is how he describes ghost the song are to their core trent reznor without rehashing by recycling or regurgitating his past effort making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy
1	this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best song on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do

1	fascinatingly unique lin manuel ha created something that changed music i can not stop listening to this album because every time i listen to it i learn more about not only the music but about race issue and history can not recommend it highly enough
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy natal day for jfk it is even above that silent night one that evergreen state re covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone i know how majestic and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring brobdingnagian posterior through song

1	is not the princess music you would likely expect it is better than it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this wa a addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i did not give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen to you are awake but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those song the others are great i loved the price on this it wa definitely worth it

1	i used to hear this song a lot on grant the radio the first year after it came out it wa really good but sadly airplay seemed early to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a one few other artist i remembered this song creative person and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than the original which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track
0	i did not realize that i had this song available to me until i saw it in the list of item that i supposedly bought and then when i read the other review and found out it is a free download i decided to listen to it i listened for about second clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is yes that is why it is free
0	deleted
0	i listened to the sample of this recording and evergreen state struck by how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later on in life after a long family relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a whitney moore young jr man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking back from a place of credence and reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to rat over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to bane god and die

1	great album no track on it that i dislike every one is worth listening to the lyric are interesting the musical style is varied and frankly just sound cool and it is a nicely long album which i always appreciate worth every penny
0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it is a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl or then cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes

0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw run and hide it sound like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o k album i rated it star because there wa no star all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad if you are wondering this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the one we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cd

0	first of all let me start out by read that while i have been a immense fan of the band since the former mean solar day i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the stuff in fact chicago is one of my favourite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some immense hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had preceding it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then fatigued the following year releasing several compilation live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their following album of new corporeal could conveniently be called xxx i care a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring in a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a tied if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to recreate the sound of the band i tell inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most firm fan base dislike this period of the band but tied if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long preceding the point of being able to make any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to tell i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway so why tied attempt to pop off down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there is not much at all to urge on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only curiosity why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album care xiv and look not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would care to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the former stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea indorse in the but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange tied poorly written line in an interesting way and let u be honest tied a lot of the corporeal on their early record were not great song but the arrangement were almost always belligerent and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real replication album or maybe they do not want to which is fine but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album
1	can you wait love this song have been waiting on this cd to come for a long time the
0	did not order do not have sex why it is showing up on my account
0	lousy quality recording you really have to be a die hard zappa fan to like it i would also say it is best to listen to after or beer
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle register track and were co written by vitas track and written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it is impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of a vitas like many performer especially those from distant land is plagued with pirated disc play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad where is you there is me kuda ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoe do not keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat try not dancing to this one i dare you in short and a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor in this one street of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in this one just techno sound and the voice a instrument
0	re non recording not the original release

0	god imagine dragon are a one hit wonder that have not gone away
1	i have also been waiting for this cd for about year now and now that it is finally out the anticipation is deffinatly worth it i love this cd it is just a amazing a i expected it is awsome it is no matter what type of music you usually listen to it is a combinaiton or hop metal it is an awsome combination it is funny adn serious so nomatter your mood is you enjoy it i think that this cd ha just made my month i got the day it out and wouldnt have it any other way go pick it up now
1	i had typed a review for another song jump shout boogie medley and that review wa for both that song and this song since i purchase both song at the same time for the same reason
0	not a good a i hoped it would be
0	i am sure he trusted ha other good cd but i have not found it yet
0	this album wa a huge letdown it is way too melodic and popish commercial light rock being a huge fan of all that remains owning all of their other album having gone to their show this album wa a major disappointment melodic can be cool wish if it is turn still heavy like on their older album but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me i do not constitute almost like the direction they have information technology gone in i liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it wa dissatisfactory i do not recommend this album to hardcore and metalcore fan
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes i realized that it wasnt him a all angstrom unit constitute from the very beginning of it i did not like the song just from the clip grouping i one time heard if you ask me this group or singer sin synthetic are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame i almost bought the cd here from amazon i am so glad that i did not
0	i like to pick out song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program i can not find here just when i think i like what i am hearing they find a way to blow the deal almost every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road recalculating weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd they can surely play but need some serious direction will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid these guy could use his help and get a singer could end up being somebody
0	not that bad of a tribute but a for myself i would really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark incline of the moon record album if you are a major and i do mean major floyd nut you whitethorn get more out of this than i did the track the corking gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy the woman vocalist just go on and on to put it another way the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band tune like speak to me brain damage and eclipse are okay at best
0	prime music is worthless i am renewing next year since i can not download prime song for free to my computer i paid for this tutorial say you can download song to your but your s app will not let me and on top of this i hate this song
0	it is a atomic number wooh

1	the first cut is the deepest is a song written by cat stevens originally released by p p arnold in may stevens own version originally on his album new master in december this one is ok but cat version is the best
1	they just do not make song like this anymore very good song recived in great condition
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor conduct set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most batch of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing washington roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during angstrom unit the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history i have always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other role player band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul big influence with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown can not get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading allow for much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent angstrom unit bear on horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try unaccompanied sitting through the minute angstrom unit can not past get enough of vainglorious you simply horrible adding to their improving problem neither ka shown a kaz on the cue writing credit nor compounding theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by conduct alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary eer groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make flat me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic adolphe sax can not get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing ralph barton perry turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal master i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and you will know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe angstrom unit think about mid s elevator music and you mho will get a feel for bonk this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but vocalise it wa also sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky displace about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are dainty some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free twelvemonth form stuff but to my ear it is basically noise sledding rating star the album romance wa also tapped for a single their last sort s gulf coast bound b w sea angstrom unit breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover displace blame designer ron lieberman certainly did not help sale hobo camp all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm can not get enough of banding you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about unmannerly to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil big thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review east why would you say such a horrible thing calling pac wack that is blasphemy right there he wa a real a it get he had quite a few positive song and he wa one of the greatest anyone would agree with me there on to my review of this cd i weep at the current state of hip hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it is pathetic cent doe not help one bit yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson on going multiple time platinum but why did this album sell so much i think it wa based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he wa shot nine time and lived to tell i mean anyone who say is a lyrical beast is totally assinine this guy is so predictable let u see if he talk about selling rock he will probably mention something about glocks in the next few word and if he mention hoe he will probably mention about him doing show and if he mention you get my point he is such a bad lyricist if he came outta the south i would understand but coming from queen ny is respected a the breeder of lyrical genius but is trash stop talking about how ja rule is he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed you are the wanksta cuz u never got back at him this album get it star because the beat are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guy living off of his shot story i love how people gave him the name and called a snitch cuz it true new title for this album get or die cry

0	absolutely simply horrible pressing save your money and just go with the remaster i got this on a inward daily deal but even at that price it wasnt worth it sound distant and deep there is absolutely no dynamic range the bass is nonexistent and wa quieter than most of my other record i have listened to it about time now just to see if it needed to break in a bit nope just horrible
1	i bought four of these for myself just in case they go out print and one deteriorates i have a vast sinatra collection this is one of the top disc the others being only the lonely swinging lover september of my year and the live at the sand being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent indeed it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find having all these song in one collection is long long overdue
0	this guy is terrific however this cd precise and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content every song on one is on the other in the on the dot exact order and i bought both thinking they would be different really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title great performer probably a decent guy but let u take one of those off the market genuinely it doubly make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky

0	i bought inward this album and accidentally had it playing in a snapchat i sent to my friend next day i got sued
0	not what i expected not my type of music but it wa free
1	love it
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just bonk blessed with the voice of whatever angel fall an absolute angel is that in my book little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout spill the bean cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
1	even though the track promise that this is disco it is really not it is bright and shiny tech house if it is disco you want ian pooleys remix in the appropriate bass riff dave angel take his own remix funkier but no le shiny wax doctor not surprisingly let the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze still no but that is fine
1	a good song you don t hear everyday a great song for those who are in love for the first fourth dimension
1	one of my favorite song
0	this say it information technology is the clean version but it is not
0	this is one of my time favorite song i got a phone and this a my ring tone like i had on my android i down the song and attempted to listen to it and got but static it wa a waste of my time and money

0	what a horrible song read to write about the awful deed you did innocent child were involved the lyric are atrocious i know that because i read them online you can never understand a word this woman say
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style so far i have had only moderate success hybrid fart that name should have been my first clue if we are even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker recording i could not find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i did not look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction the music struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review
1	know
0	i received the album and it looked great except for the information technology dint in the sleeve and when i opened it it had a dint in the record
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never another bowl same here with chicago and with their intense musical and political statement and then and mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the and such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are concerned about funding their retirement year with this drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some from this minute song for the ipod are the name of the game the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago i will not hold my breath a this ha rumoured to be their swan song too bad
0	sound quality is so low you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it it is a nice song though
0	did not like the way it wa sung fortunately it wa free information technology because i certainly would not choose to buy it

1	best version of one of my favorite song try that i have ever heard watch it with video on youtube to take in the whole scenario visually stunning a well a a joy to listen to
0	i am a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to usance them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the goddamn around it is been a long time since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sound like an audience shot cellular telephone vid with the sound ripped off it it is just atrocious everything is just muddled together and foggy sounding i am aware live is live but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio i am really surprised the band put their pigeonhole of approval on this memorialize a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent memorialize mixing after rumor of a new memorialize baring no yield i think this wa just slapped together with little effort just to amaze something out there sloppy effort by all involved i am still front for good select sound television memorialize of the initial reunion tour this peerless aint gon na cut it sorry
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust jumpy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to think the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period tack the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the amphetamine crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music what happened to free
1	love this song it is truly magic my fave coldplay song in a while looking forward to the eternal rest of the album
1	one of his best to date

0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now wife laurie anderson both are outstanding artist and musician i knew john zorn only by name remuneration before i bought this album it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone lou reed phil anderson newfangled play electric guitar laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone the producer obviously told everybody to improvise if you have ever grease one palm listened to lou reed metal information technology machine music you know what to expect the result is essentially white noise unlistenable definitely for completists only and do not bother to pay the elevated price from dealer here a short internet search will reveal that it is still available from the stone webshop this limited edition will take some time event to sell out

0	her music is horrible and she support endorses and sleep with lilo brancato a cop killer if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society

0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd then do not even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium

0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it is a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl or then cd cassette form a cloud in a package is a honest b side track with a techno dub sense a la sapidity say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slow down down so it sense comparable an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes

1	i this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set pace of the whole album almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song i am for say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive before the nine a half minute latin bugaloo sum up all band are about you are already into and like to collect original album you will not go adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable can not praise it enough

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another lp issue of the fischer unrecorded performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why

1	beautiful meaningful song god speaks through this song and encourage those who listen
1	you know i am just not attune enough to go through album by album listing the difference from archetype to remastered but i will say bear or or for this seven albulm set is tremendous i am probably like a big contingent of springsteen fan i became aware during the born in the usa tour then purchased all the previous cassette so in the close year cassette were lost and or became obsolete now i am able to leverage all seven for what amount to each that is a win right there and like a number of people i find the first seven springsteen to be the best sans a couple of live album so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with
1	excellent album by christopher cross i bought extra copy for friend
1	love medicine their music
1	it is light hearted and happy it fit in nicely a background for a fire up slideshow i did
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas album they knew what would work and what would not and made their musical selection accordingly you will notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but big name produce big fear and so we have this piece of musical garbage a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doe not dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention

0	according to frontman songwriter celestial longitude mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa swell deserved production credit rating on the premise thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval include consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit rating tot wa the last record album randy bto bachman ever so produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they blend with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songster in the business wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to sound out no to some of celestial longitude le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper record album sound like swell aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever so heard stake when it wa a hit and one of my darling by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche bag randy supposedly is production credit rating indeed that this record album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they yet ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full record album sheesh talk about a dibrach triumph although by s ten they had started to bang some a again this record album represents a period of slump in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doe not necessarily take any more credit rating for their success than celestial longitude songwriting but sometimes it is what a producer will not let the artist do that is just a important ya know
1	awing brings back many memory of good time i am a sucker for the oldie
1	great great song
0	once i would downloaded this i felt by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy the title track wa somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song not a sad one do think peter do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing
1	decent change for adam
0	why evergreen state the price so low all the track are mislabeled
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not know that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first time the final you do not know end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer do not throw away your money and if it is on the radio change the station
0	buyer beware this is only a sample of the track it is only a second clip not worth
1	phenomenal recording on th century record from the great piano player ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be formally released on cd it control premium in the collector market and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician i remember when i had the track of this back in the that i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doe not come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd formatting which i have done with many out of print vinyl album still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing stage and playact on jamal play jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand forte piano and fender rhodes with the tremendous background horn and string by evans two of the piece pasture and death resurrection are particularly bomber calcined lime with brainy interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar model of ahmads cautionary composing and stage skill a well my favored piece on the album swahililand is also the foresightful at almost tenner minute and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous triad minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horn and string before he kick in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on conga al ternating from left channel to right jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the tour de force it is the final track on the album and close it out in fine style extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing stage and playact that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive appeal of jamals output over the year and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal play jamal is my favored of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island saucer phosphorus s had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover sound better than ever

0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doe help matter much it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it is too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic old country music album a it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you do not know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then is for you all others would be better looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal

0	if you are a big fan bonk of trivium style on their first operating theater two cd then ghostly do not even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein hour angle of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two open effort information technology i give this album two thumb down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium

1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on one is that we will expire another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam sate album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings powerfully and becharm with an angry heavy mat vocal performance the song are a tricky a ever and shoot out all the light carry a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great lay and this doe not change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this three and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cover but holy crap doe motorhead bump off this song i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doe not try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique mat spin out on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band need a in the u s so i inspire you if you wish some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no le onto the music the vocal are merely adequate and on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i bland guitar amp sound just doe not have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just do not even begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called vocalist andrew a guy who the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke
1	with child great mix
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day i not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them that point they at least had some huge hit single wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the they then spent the next releasing various compilation live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not that we could get to the point in their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of numeral indicated possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the sound of band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down path who were they trying to reach with this album worst of all the failed there is not much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back the but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let u be even a lot the material on their early record were not great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they do not want to which is fine but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation live album
0	i buy the song but they never let me download it into computer
1	a great follow up to her award winning duet with jason aldean and clock her tv show duet kelly sings with famed country information technology artist vince gill to create a truly lovely song it is information technology well sung and it keep running through my head it is one of those hear it one time and know you will buy it song imho enjoy

0	this is not the version that you are looking bear for have not found the version sung on ondine yet dang it
0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is not well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who seemed to sell million of record were in bad taste musically this cd take that to a whole other level
0	i downloded this song to listen to new music but it is not my preference it is a very experimental music for my preference

0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review east why you say such a thing calling pac wack that is blasphemy right there he wa a real a it get he had quite a few positive song and he wa one of greatest anyone would agree me there on to my review of this cd i weep at the current state of hip hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it is pathetic cent doe not help one bit yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson going multiple time platinum but why did this album sell so much i think it wa based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he wa shot nine time and lived to tell i mean anyone who say a lyrical beast is totally assinine this guy is so predictable let u see if he talk about selling rock he will probably mention about glocks in the next few word and if he mention hoe he will probably mention about him doing show and if he mention you get my point he is such a bad lyricist if he came the south i understand but coming from queen ny is respected a the breeder of lyrical genius but is trash talking about how ja rule is he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed you are the wanksta cuz u got back at him this album get it star because the beat are hella thanks to dre and eminem two of the best this guy living off of his shot story i love how people gave him the name and called a snitch cuz it true new title for this album get or die cry

1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the and while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big band incarnation woody brought a reasonably decent band along a well even though he wa entering the last decade of his spirit amazing guy amazing version of la fiesta starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little snatch wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff get up in the middle shrieking trumpet a nifty tiberi solo and amazing dynamic a good a version a you will find anywhere
1	awesome brings back many memory of good time i am a sucker for the oldie

0	total ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck very anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would care it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason i would ever so put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually at least close to punk but besides that nothing very appeal to me rhythm is an ok song but the ease sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i do not suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back

1	very well put together list of classic music that relaxes you i would definately recommend this to anyone even if they are not a big fan of classic music
0	first off i would like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i do not really like this album a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i do not get far in when i have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they consist of poor lyric dodgy music and ridiculous spelling this way is by far jewel best album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever you do not need to sell your body to sell record
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on i cringe and die inwardly a sung little inside it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time aside from the fact that the song consists of line of lyric with no substance they borrow the can can song and make it even angstrom unit more irritating

0	i for some reason do not like this song at all i find it very annoying how do i delete this song off my play list lol
0	i heard a hold up performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a phone number of the song on this album have an over driven deformation sound effect when you hear the song hold up the effect is compelling and the sound blackmail add to the performance but on the album edition the deformation effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music i ran the album through a hold up music audio foil claesson edward antony richard louis hold up audio foil and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is spread out and full of clipping which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed the end result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is

0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas album they knew what would work and what would not and progress to their musical selection accordingly you will notice that buffett neer once touch the spiritual piece and tull touch spiritual piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always demand himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his part but grown name produce grown fear and so we have this piece of musical garbage a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doe not dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the armed service may have just found a new softening up option prior to high school level interrogation but it could be against the geneve convention
1	beautiful
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure to the mass songwriter turn me on to something new v me compare her version to the well one and come on taking on bos version tougher than the rest who advised you
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register and is a very successful song most the track on this release tend to have heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle register track and were co written vitas track and written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it is impossible to a favorite vitas cd but this hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of a vitas like many performer especially those from land is plagued with pirated disc play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad where is you there is me kuda ti ya get on your dancing shoe do not keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound a that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat try not dancing to this one i dare you in short a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor this one street of the a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of upper i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in this just techno sound and the voice a instrument
1	great with child song
0	i hate the song sweet home kid combined this song with that now i can not get it out of my head not that sweet home alabama is a bad song but i have heard way too many time i grew up in and wa worn out on the song by i wa five
0	yes this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself he doe need the other guy also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard taylor for the album the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle i am not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and gotten a decent singer even blaze bailey is a good singer he did not have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron maiden requires but blaze bailey can sing i do not know who told this richard taylor that he could sing
0	i require am sorry move around but i did not like this cd i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen very good song but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kid are very talented and great musician however i thought the song writing wa bad the lyric one bad and the vocal were bad vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah directly need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own signature and personality into them not just read them off the sheet laugh at of paper she is young and gift i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this angstrom unit talent remember her janis joplin play cover turtle blue that is what i am talking about she need to do more flat of that this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd somebody need to help them with their songwriting it wa all over the place on this cd i am hoping they can turn it around but for now i am backing off for a while love to see where they go from here good luck you guy
0	not the same sound a the original version sound the like a different singer yuck

1	i use to play this over over again when i wa in college i so loved this song
1	i love the new cd
0	i am disappointed in this version of the song i can not understand the word at all the singer are not louder than the accompaniment so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the word especially in a christmas carol there is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty
1	country continues to out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song which is sung from the viewpoint soldier who lost their in various war this is a poignant and important recording and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric
1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why

0	i have been a dylan devotee from way back and i am also a big sinatra devotee i pen this review from that perspective what ha happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated food waste like this candela is getting such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this candela necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these song and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are purportedly emote frankly this candela is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is dreaded no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra safe i am a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not recommend for dylan devotee and certainly not recommend for sinatra devotee

0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it is inward a shame what pas for hip hop these day people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all because lil wayne is whack i am not a hater i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he is just another average untalented main prove stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are in that location trying to laugh at pa off a hip hop inward also the fact that people are claiming that the album ware in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the one best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music

0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most men however i find this cd completely unpointed and tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy cry lyric in a strong french stress that sound a if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally bring out music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some folk would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be merchandising point trustfulness me they aint

1	i will start off by saying that i am one of those completist type i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he is done and i have to admit this particular album get the most play you will know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it show it is extremely thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that it is much slower it is not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes album right now they are quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer

1	commix deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next with child thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard decent ha finally found a niche of it is own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings decent fresh idea on with a self colored understanding of their root to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high school from beginning to end if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection

1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank sir bernard williams country tune the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album besides you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the actually gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there is anything wrong with that it is just a refreshing change for his fan

0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let u just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i did not like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst i have heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it did not matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that she is still country her album is not even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her
1	love this song so fun my and year old it too we jam out to it in the

1	the cd got to pr in no time it wa in great condition and it wa overall perfect since i love manson and his new album
1	traditional country
0	full disclosure i have not listened to this entire album it wa just too awful look the bottom line this album is year too late if this ha been released in the s when everyone wa on psyc drug then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit but this is it just doe not work
0	first off i would like to say that i commend jewel with trying something little different and experimenting with a new sound it get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i it have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit folky song on the other hand i do not really like this a few song i do like and i do enjoy to but i do not get far in when i have to skip track stand intuition haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they consist of poor lyric dodgy music and ridiculous spelling this way is by far jewel best album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever you do not need to sell your body to sell record
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock rod should not attempt to do old standard strictly commercial no heart
1	this is a great song worth having in your collection fast and easy download able to sample before you buy i love this about amazon
1	another solid release this cd fit in twelvemonth well with the rest of the music ty ha put out over the year
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection even if you like francis albert sinatra you will be disappointed in dylan interpretation if this is what he carry on to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it very dismal not even good for lift music
0	paul taylor music is non not the same a when i bought his earlier cd the music is not a great a it wa before
0	this album is horrible the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be put out to pasture i not believe they would put their on such a performance problem david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa a such he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly he sings half of the lyric the rest are he all kind of embellishment to the lyric he change up the tempo of the lyric coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward he u completely different lyric when a song break down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama jimmy kimmel right this album wa released you will what i am talking about that wa the most rendition of panama that i have ever heard he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse i will sing it for right this time in other word dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and i will wait which are the main reason i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is dave go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love

0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival and loved every single song based on that i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it after hearing these song i definitely will not be purchasing this album the girl are definitely beautiful all right it is easy to see why they are so well loved because of it but on this album their voice have not matured enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their later work where they do not sing with little girl voice and their song selection is a little more mature

0	i bought this album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang back up you could barely even hear them this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down the drain

1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy constitute i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without age really paying much attention in my thirty i had information technology dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gee album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice multitude i would ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought practise every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding one journey that wa his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously over again the huge album from the seventy did not interest me much despite their genius danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album i have often wondered what robin gibb would have a luck would have it done with his voice if he had not been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the pop song after all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album come the closest to proving that just listen to do not cry alone one if you do not believe identical me and while many of the track are once again pop they are more mature both bonk in lyric and in vocal and i love that record album he u his along terrific range from one song g force to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely but so well naturally if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you shape are going to buy this album if course strike you are simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not record album plainly the most unique haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot wish that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the whole of one disc even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter creative person disc are not bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the non earlier demo are pretty eve depressing motley sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition well situated would be fine for most fan overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette

1	this album is a great example of the angstrom unit jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the and while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big band incarnation woody brought a pretty decent band along a well even though he wa entering the last decade of his life amazing guy amazing version of la fiesta starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from angstrom unit woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed on in the middle constitute shrieking trumpet a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamic a good a version a you atomic number will find anywhere
0	i noticed seventy seven people also did not order angstrom unit this and it showed up in their order not a way to promote a band
1	nice change for adam
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i stone have to admit bonk this is the first album of his i have bought and no in case you are wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on military man my choosing to purchase this cd it did not hurt thing though i will get right to the album save yall bear any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a pestering superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream ballad maker nasvhille songwriter that is the bad thing the good thing is angstrom unit greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these stone song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of actuate em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is by a heartbreaker hired man while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is constitute a fun look constitute at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you can not english hawthorn move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood is not trying anything new here this is territory that is been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it is definitely the album of the moment so to newfangled continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time

1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the sun a nasty burn now is not that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it is just fantastically brilliant

0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i wish am biased however the original use string pin up for the main line this u brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat slue with a drummer who drove the tune placement and gave distinct cheek accent this aint that cut for information technology those who relish sung soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i do not even like the lalo shiffren version of the man jacques louis david clear cut from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at that is out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing information technology and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i do not think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for those of you who were not i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson
1	i will start off by saying that i am one of those completist type i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or soul i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he is done and i have to admit this particular album get down the most play you will love dwyer from his raunchy mean solar day of coachwhip fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it show it is extremely thick reverb soaked screaming fury but the catch is that it is much slower it is not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice howl over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes album right now they are quite an short but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer

1	the first cut is the deepest is a song written by cat stevens originally released by p p arnold in may stevens own version originally appeared on his album new master in december this one is ok but cat version is the best
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want hippopotamus for christmas is best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic it is honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming is of my personal favorite the are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with christmas carol can be a bad the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track her irresistible attitude make an appearance well i give it a solid recommendation
1	best song of that year waiting for the next one

0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic stone magazine issue march it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time overlooked gem and curio that mightiness be of interest to hard stone fan ummm advantageously part of that plan ha been achieve they are certainly curio curio from the realm of apathy generation because that is what you will probably feel when listening to these track certainly tucky buzzard ha had some reason to exist and a few of these track mightiness pique the interest of the occasional aficionado but much of it is so eclectic it is hard to see anybody listening to these number and thinking to themselves hey i got ta get me some more tune by the aynsley dunbar retaliation and i do not will not to dis this sampler even though that is what i am doing it is just that people into these striation probably have every darn thing they always put to vinyl group and nothing here is likely to convince the not already converted if you get my drift anyway i played this once and that wa a chore

1	air return with love their best work in my impression since s moon safari the gallic pair have taken a more observational approach to this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee or else the album offer mayhap air more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of direct contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album single ha to expect some surprisal along the way do the joy an odd track to outset the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall experience the song sound like something from hz legend with it is multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice essence not the album inviolable but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your distinctive second song it hold a sense of simple mindedness though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord onward motion and air the orchestral bell add an awesome experience sound like something you would hear at the end of moon safari peculiarly the recent half of the piece it wasnt my preferred at first but after a few listens it grew on me so alight is her football game the first song to really feature film lyric dynamic the music sound pocket symphony epoch with the song being driven by soft and hovering string i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd determination i believe but who jazz mayhap it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song you would think air would garden truck with it is western like experience the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it is fun but besides lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey that is something you will probably be use to at this stage right missing the alight of the day an interesting tune with some instead unique sound if you have ever seen air bouncy you would jazz what i am talking about they seem to garden truck some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if you have heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve tress nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and single of the best in my impression contrary to what i have mention so far with wish to lyric absence i have always been single to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to garden truck a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamic bearing the song sound like two turned into single the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven alight definitely single of the album standout track itd be right at home plate with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it is swirling onward motion peculiarly towards the mediate half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the soft driven experience of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great compounding of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily single of the best on the entire album simple yet so in force in it delivery there is just adequate direct contrast between refrain verse and so on to give the tune a fresh experience if you are going to get somebody into this album nay air themselves this power be a good starting point eat my beat single of the shortest on the album the song is a good divulge from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth air line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being remind of the recent half of moon safari with this single young star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it is little sister acoustic and laid back in it is approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it is distorted harmonica interlude it is bound to sooth whatever sorrow you are get and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably single of the most interesting track on the album with it is hand picked guitar segment and it is front line horn air it is a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and restrain you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but i am not ruing out a higher score it is definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really inebriate in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who is been hanging for a different approach fomr these gallic ambient master your

0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you one can get over the drastic change in instrumentation this atomic number album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it would not be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked that is what this is they did not just slightly switch constitute the sound of the instrument they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instrument keep in mind i hate hipster and went with what can only record album be described a a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if this wa their first tool album would they ever have made it beyond their local audio bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to banding completely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we conniption simply one all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new well and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby batch but sang froid like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to pop they should have learned from u

0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music what happened to free
0	is not the the acapella and it heavily distorted amazon music fail
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really do not know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the three plus year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent effort packed with pop punk hook can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three plus year layoff between album or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin near you right next to all those old lfo album

0	frankly i have no idea what the other review is trying to order however i will way out a care to anyone considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of level and not the version you probably know from the radio if you are a dj this could be a outstanding addition to your collection if not well this might be what you are looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive
0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the his delivery wa so i wa truly looking forward to his solo unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of confession it is possible that they tried to emulate the success of wild thang which explains the song miss and cold thang however even with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came across a example is the pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by c wa anything but funky title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track album not enough to save the album however
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one very short a little over a minute buyer should be notified have never seen such a short rendition and be charged more like a sample
0	the worst album i ever purchased wa nevermind i constitute had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fan recommended it so highly but i am sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have record album let me down it is hard to listen to more than song at one go i found the album to be monotonous boring the song are very bad and the vocal extremely are awful
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut record album i expected and anticipated expectant thing from lifehouse although second record album are known to be difficult i beleived the band to have promise how wrong washington i there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face it all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied savor in music and i do make love a melody when it come my way but there is no melody on this record album deserving writing about i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you like lifehouse because of no name face trust me check away from this so you tranquillise have some love for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy eat world even the calling whose record album i also consider suffers from having only one good song on it but is tranquillise better than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere
1	another solid song from the new skillet album that showcase their softer side while this is not nearly the side if skillet i often listen to it is good enough in it own mightily rating
0	i am very disappointed the wording on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original artist bear it is not it is a mix sung by a wedding singer cruise line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be published with remake of original artist song without the permission of identical the original usance artist hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song very redo misleading and disappointing
0	i read some sterling go over and finaly tracked down this rare cd no musical theme why the go over were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pas for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my accumulation and this peerless ha not peerless redeem feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
0	i always liked this call i like the werewolf of london too he is a great classic rock artist to listen to
1	great remix of one of key song of the show give a great feeling to a strong number

0	what is it with this guy will he ever have the gut to release another album without a greatest hit package have tagged onto this new material this guy for year ha re released the same old music the one time he did not with a million budget invincible only sold million copy in the usa even though his million budget wa directed to construct only marketing sell in the usa why doe not everyone go to cnet com go to the military policeman downloads section get yourself a free mp cd ripper then get jackson first solo album or really any of his album make copy of them then burn your own cd of your own personal choice of song that in a nutshell is what michael jackson ha done for year he know his new unaccompanied stuff cant stand turn on it own so then we sole need greatest hit package tagged on or just release box bear set number one bonk etc etc i have never seen another guy live off his past more then him word to the wise get yourself a free mp cd ripper rip your already owned old material and make your own cd with different selection because that is all he is doing

0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those me who think these would be selling point me they aint
1	i thought it wa fabulous i am the same age a barbra and knew she wa going to be something special the first time i heard back when this is her best yet

0	i guess i do not have the right twist to play them unable to view
0	what is the most annoying about set is in fact amount of material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all blank space at the end of each cd you end up almost an hour of unused space to leave track such a take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable
0	there is only unitary song on this cd worth listening to i recoment getting the mp version of tarzan boy and ignore the rest of the song
0	this wa purchased for someone else i do not like it medicine because i think it is an annoying song not my type of music
1	the majestic song dead or alive open this album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides jim goodwin peter muny robert medici alone deserving the price of the album this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet draw of john gatchell a live version with a significantly different feel appears on nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href come alive dp b ijz ref cm cr arp vitamin d rvw txt ie utf come alive a fighter pilot is some other frenzied track where the bomberettes ply frisky background vocal whilst cales voice viola rule on the multi layered wilson joliet eery gothic street of laredo is a slow hatch piece with strange percussive sound effect that would not seem out of place in the work of edgar edgar varese equally downtempo strange clock in casablanca ha surrealistic lyric and a psychedelic texture the highly observational title track is a strange atonal affair dominated by the french intone of honi soit qui mal y pense prod of in high spirit pitched backing vocal and the weird roar of dissonant synths guitar normality return with the mournful melodious riverbank that reach a crescendo before fading out on ravish instrumentation it recall the gentler side of nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href wrong way up dp b lnb ref cm cr arp vitamin d rvw txt ie utf wrong way up a cales collaboration with brian eno russian roulette rock hard in the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href slow dazzle dp b n n ref cm cr arp vitamin d rvw txt ie utf slow dazzle a nbsp manner and the album concludes with legerdemain lie a striking blend of classical and rock that expires on the last gasp of shuddering drum pattern honi soit is an uneven album and not amongst cales most accessible

1	i wish more folk knew about ernests music this is not your typical folk artist ernest wa makin folk blue rock music in the before he launched his composition career in la film score television score emmy later he got back to his root gave u the opportunity to enjoy where he came from his hobby a he describes it listen to this album it wa released nearly a year before katrina besides the prescient title cut evangaline disturbin blue travelin shoe should solidify your love of this talented composer singer song writer and guitarist par excellance
0	condition wa stated acceptable just listenable
0	i did not like any of this music terrible selection americium i am going to try and get a refund for this purchase
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down worst in some way i wish it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song the best one have been collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard mr groban ha sung off album various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let u he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those performance have added along the way many your venue i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect the right material for the album this doe shine through despite the haphazard of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy
0	frankly i have no idea what the other review is trying to say however i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of level and not the version you probably know from the radio if you are a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this might be what you are looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive
1	still a moral force and sexy song from an amazing artist
1	honestly i wa never a huge fan of this song the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he love song one of his favorite he think it is really romantic etc not the kind of thing might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day i have always known the lyric but they have more meaning for me now also digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version his voice doe not now just go to show how important recording quality is
1	simply put yes very relaxing encouraging motivating hope instilling inspiring reminds you good thing encouraging you to remember the creator promise
0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading inwardness the review to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any snowy other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there some other but cobain did not speak to you in improving rap fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan that is the catch operating theater twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their read idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana time lag you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence live of complexity or beauty chieftain his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other comfortably wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously should not need to call any attention braxton bragg to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let u simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the rest of the band member were also mho hardly virtuoso well so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an operating theater album inspect this postulate it show in what feller we now rap consider to be classic is also completely dependent on constitute the dish diversity of sound and style which the album leo the lion employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind operating theater and all other nirvana bonk album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan that is three strike nirvana fan yep so i will leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it is not too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the bonk archetypal american stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out or we are only in it for the money constitute the fug the fug elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bend or hail to the thief filch you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love

pink moon or five leaf left the beatles sgt pepper revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo la tengo i can hear the heart beating a one or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock holy writ music and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or non traditional sounding vocal then you should listen to these album instead television marquee moon associate in nursing the flaming lip zaireeka dish record album yoshimi battle the pink robot or the soft bulletin captain beefheart safe a milk lick my decal off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday lady operating theater in satin or song for distingue lover van defy sole morrison astral week the pixy surfer rosa morphine cure inward buckeye state for pain or yes tom wait rain dog or swordfish

1	worth it
0	wow i am really disappointed in this i judge i am just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the band sound muddled and uninspired i get the picture they are going through the motion which they are and could really care le any longer what they put out roth sound soooooo bad it is really embarrassing and i am still not excited about the set list it is not that it a bad set list but they have become a testimonial band to themselves considering they pick out to ignore album worth of material a if it never materialize and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh would play of a new album they were proud of what they did and dying to show it off there are birdcall on adkot that are just beggary to be played live but i am venture well never hear em attaint to put this out and not have cut like big river you and your blue or beat workn on here a terribly remould and unoriginal a adkot wa i still enjoyed the release quiet a bite i play it often and it ha some heavy birdcall to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of day light what a attaint i will pa i own about every vh cd that is been released had iii but got free of it but i will pa on this one i will still listen to the studio cut heck daves last solo wa pretty good but i will pa on the live money grab thank you very much

1	i liked this song when i first get word it on the loud speaker at the gym while i wa working out with weight
1	great blueys song
0	i wa in when i listened this album it made very poor impression then but i thought i would go back and take another some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity i am horny i am stoned seriously listening to this album i can not believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review is not about surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my theory so far is jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable i believe that contribution wa most to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek densmore and perhaps morrison simply not accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more his stage antic a pretty face producing voice and a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest
1	i love this song i also like this one girl is on fire i love her i look forward to her next album
1	our dance a husband and wife wa to this song i hope we are dancing to it for year to come
1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and clock over then you know you have got a good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing and at saame the same time slightly rockin i would say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard with girl vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send a chill expiation down your spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing inward and on plenty of paper and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony every song ha it moment of pure joy and satisfaction it just make you feel good simply put it just good listening good music for atomic number exactly the ear
0	this album just did not do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cd and love them to expiry it is too girly and poppy for me high pitched the lyric are not all that clear and do not mesh well together to mean one matter most of all the melody of the song are difficult to listen to you know how some song are just difficult for the ear to revel these song are fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling replete song though control underground and sleepwalking get prima from me the rest get about prima i can not relate to them much and i do not get much pleasure from listening to them but i will incessantly love tbms older stuff and their newer hide and seek album

1	here is a frank sinatra blunt single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago ol blue eye strike recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his stellar heyday at capitol record released in january of the tune spent week on the chart and peaked at the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it strike before this is the original hit recording

1	some other hit
1	this second single from the new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john cooper strained voice show more here than on of their rock song but it still a good song with a great message of letting love cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along the line of lucy although american noise not a story if you are not familiar with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good rock band
0	poor pitiful sound quality
0	a great slow song i loved this slow song when i wa a teenaged in high school i cogitate it came out immediately after if i ever i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine not too long after i became a freshman in college music ha always been a great companion of mine their unison are great concord a their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song it is a classic they cue me of the guy from the platter i cogitate that is my grandparent generation
1	if you have watched the tv show then you already know how catchy the song are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length i have not actually verified this but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music
1	identical very good
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying of the song is the repeated you do not know that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first time the final you do not know end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very singer do not throw away money and if it is on the radio change the station
0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed to top it off the theme included in this album are dull and flat

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum john brockman drum and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i wa not paying to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i do not mind if i do not like the song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the producer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music only a name to milk a they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play drum on of the song this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after a thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable from any out take from any of the album from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who made the song and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some good playing by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album and good production buy it and love it
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not let down with this pressing firstly off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are brilliantly the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite encompassing even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they were not this leaf a good one third or so empty space on each side which really downplay inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that break may lie down with my magazine alignment a far a the actual music i have only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the firstly vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the muscularity throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift similar are present in momentary lapse this is more similar obscured by cloud there is really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it is one of those album that is manifestly think of to be listened to a a whole it is really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album boiler suit it is nothing outstanding but it is a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in allow eve their early day when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop image allow for of the rest of quiet the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever fecund possessed ha long since evaporated david lee collection roth is not merely bad in get under one skin the way that many so called rock vocalist of the were bad nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a they get older he get under one skin is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than try harder he doe not even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this neer on the unsuspecting public

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that ha not stopped from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his during live show because he no longer those note a they were recorded there come a in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator this case musician i believe that the time ha for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a up prize fighter

0	i liked this song until i watched the video come on then robin thicke got twerked on by miley ugh while his wife played it cool for a while eventually she left him and finally he say he ha addiction issue am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where the singer actor personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song movie see anything by amy winehouse all thing brad pitt gwyneth paltrow or rihanna

1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the line of invincible or angelica archangelica this is perfect evil coming from thomas bergersen and ding pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepy song in this whole album it ha a very scant about fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we commence from the scant of the sun a nasty burn now is not that fun it would be like barney savagely murdering all of his kid it is just fantastically brilliant
1	first cd i have bought in a angstrom unit long time sturgill simpson non should have won a grammy for this album in my opinion and i am not even that much into country music this guy is in a genre of his own and it kick a can not wait to see what he come up with on his next album

1	fantabulous
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago and with their intense musical and political statement and then and mega wimpy commercial hit chicago no longer relevant like they were in the and such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind fire and that they wanted to do an album significance in many interview during their year hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band adamant doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested their legacy are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control this project well i am certain they will some hit from this minute pop for the ipod are the name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the record whether it is solo or ooops i will not hold my breath this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad

0	i do not understand how serious yes fan can consider this fly from here to be a real yes album step back to the real world dude this read is nothing else than an album that could be better doctor of osteopathy titled a drama vol but this time full moon the performing band name is maybe hey but what can you really expect when there is no more in that location jon anderson and rick or even his so talented son adam wakeman back in the full gang in addition trevor horn ha buggles ed the music once again this fly from sir thomas more here definitely only ha the cover art another excellent work of the maestro roger dean of a yes album the music really performed displace by the band maybe and zero star
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i must say i am very disappointed pry with this album like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago lean that peaked in the early seventy these were the one time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm terry look kath and peter cetera however lean a most fan know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty so one might ask what devotee doctor of osteopathy wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although i am sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement non he did not contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent effort and in many way it seems more chicago than xxx why could not robert have saved some of his look material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mix coalesce here but what are they they sure do not seem too chicago sir thomas more and then there are the horn everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark disengage distinction while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added bear afterthought forced along and contrived also the cheesy percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix pry bar free just make doctor of osteopathy it seem a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single angstrom unit these guy are talented musician they do not need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
1	i am sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i bought it for but alan jackson just doe exceptional job with it

0	i just finished downloading from the cloud and there is a trouble four of the track will not play on window sensitive player or on winamp on a window xp system the forged track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i effort to open them in window sensitive player nothing happens the name energy not even appear in the playlist if i effort to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the trouble is caused by the file name path being too foresighted window will not even allow you rename them in the convention way update i have found a workaround to the file trouble which is list at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section most the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line of reasoning in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo so classical music is not necessarily destine to be soporific but the selection on this pair of military police disc seems to be quite erratic to level out just one glower example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you like but do not ask to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it is finished file repair solution a i surmise the trouble is the excessive distance of the file name and path the entire route that the computer take to set out to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collecting of the most relaxing classical music in the universe that is character right there which leaf character for the track name now allow u consider the name of one of the non usable file disc sonata for two piano in f underage op b ii andante united nation poco adagio sonata for two piano in f underage op b ii andante united nation poco adagio military police that is character so the total is character well over the character limit window just can not grip that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a list above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation mark that is character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will allow you rename the individual file go through and chop shot out all the duplicate information in the example given above you will cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something sane like relaxing classical music which will give you a total distance of character if you contribute the new file name from the example above which is character you will see that you end up with a total of character well under the character limit of course one wonder why did not amazon mean about this and use a sane album name and file name without duplicate in the first place my conclusion given that at to the lowest degree four of the track are not relaxing and you will have to spend at to the lowest degree minute have a go at it around to fix the file name error imho this collecting just is not worth the trouble even if it is free to begin with of course if you are really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i mean amazon could and should do a dear job i know i would if i worked for them

0	according to renown frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a information technology thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto bachman curve ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly eer they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is that the man who exactly for year had st arranged for them and infirm groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in the business wa now out the blab door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say washington no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released later roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is out production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more washington to their popularity wa at scurry the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out liken they basically had kicked themselves constitute out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury proscribed they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some a again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they simply rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doe not necessarily take any more credit for their success than ra songwriting but sometimes it is what a producer will not let the artist do that is just a important ya know

0	jimmy buffett ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas album they knew what would work and would not and made their musical selection accordingly you will notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a arrangement but then dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and wrong for what is left of his voice but big name produce big fear and so we have this piece of musical garbage a many have noted the only piece that work at all is be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doe not dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention

0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is keen a usual but the lyric will lose you there are two song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the sleep of the lyric are just hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make horse sense of it all erg ay caramba one note samba pelican state pelican state pelican state pelican state bamba or jolly springtime ohio the jolly springtime in the merry calendar month of may ohio the heavenly minute ohio the come again hour interval or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl she is about to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativeness and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i do not know but i had to heed to this cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about
1	bonk slipknot new album i am a huge fan aka maggot highly recommend to all the maggot out there
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song the rest is well all filler and the record is only half an hour long so there are only about another five complete song track one is a reminder angstrom unit of maiden sole s number cryptic of the beast and track three is second long it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well piece of advice tape or download the single and spend your money on decently something else
1	i love this and on of it all it wa super easy to download and to listen on any device
0	this is horrible the rest of van halen doing a terrific job but david roth should be put to pasture i not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problem david lee roth think he is lee roth circa a such he feel free take liberty sing the song incorrectly he only sings half of the lyric the rest are spoken he add all kind of lame embellishment the lyric he change up the tempo of the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a lot of stupid to the audience during the song that are just awkward he u completely different lyric when a song break down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is not at all he barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album wa released you will know what i am talking about that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that i have ever heard he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right the next verse i will sing it you this time other word dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and i will wait which are the main reason i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love disappointment

1	yes it is a great song
0	this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or at but even though is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky chateau of the westies etc many the song on the fox frustratingly close to being classic ej song just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the fall bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which is not a great album but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his form

0	what lupus erythematosus can i say it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album apparently there worthy is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here what complete jibberish how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release while i would love to say i am shocked mr taylor would sanction this stop it is apparently one of the many new le than desirable trend the record company world health organization have espoused lately to get those few of u left who support physical medium to shell out more dough disgusting
0	non not great
0	i got it for free at st i did not really like it i like black veil saint bridget and the fray it is just not my kind of music now i like this song though i had to hear it a couple of time before it strike home
1	great guitar and synth meld together agreeably vocal are smooth and hypnotic overall a great album
1	love this version of tu amor mi amor by formula five use to listen when growing my mom love cupid the song good time
1	there really is two fall apart affair to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song the product is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the rivet to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary rivet of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a what is your name what really fall apart this is the lack of glamor in the road modus vivendi and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a some other getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend some other night lone really an precise view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road graeco roman such a bend the pageboy and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
1	this sung come from one of the more obscure gerge harrison album but will always be one of my favorite song
0	honestly i hate this song i bought it because my band cover it and i had learn it it is another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem i respect them and really like some of stuff ace wa a bos but this is just campy
0	beyond stupid even more stupid and irritating than actually having phone
0	i got this because it supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility many of the example or story drag on waaaaaay to long
1	he is sings about the love he ha for jesus i have always loved his m music i love this cd
0	i really do not appreciate amazon not allowing use our reward on our credit card when we buy mp s i do not accrue that many reward credit on my credit card it would much more fair if we use those towards mp purchase
0	i wa told this wa happy music find it boring depressing i am tossing it
0	why is amazon selling nazi virago propaganda
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane dos down on july at age his legion of fan simply refused to let go from that point to no le than of his rca single release would make the country chart seven of them crossing over to the billboard popping hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore considerably understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in arrange this excerpt digest together under the title the essential jim reef to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country collision single between and of which span over to the hot six to the adult contemporary chart which did not begin until and one to the r b chart never mind the one hundred of equally rattling excerpt from his many eps and lp all in all however i would say he did a evenhandedly credible job augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and ternary more photo of jim including one with wife virgin mary at an award ceremony a partial discography of the content is also included but without any chart detail all but track recorded in and included on an early lp were collision for jim of them popping crossover only track made only the country list going to early in his edition of the previous standard i love you because wa recorded in and wa first bring out on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country collision a a single note too that the edition of am i losing you wa the one cut in and bring out on rca victor going to country hot a the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first edition practise in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest collision represented here and the one that lead off the phonograph recording is quaternity wall country for eight week in which wa his initial popping crossover however this came after country collision beginning in with mexican joe for nine week credited to jim reef and the lap o ranch boy so i tend to agree with another commentator who say that at to the lowest degree one of those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cut to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you a considerably a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart both still it is hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum star
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into sung certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original sung have and we had fearsome enough of that song that is what this song totally ride on at least chris brown inward solar day even though it is a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better st lyric nice video altogether i just do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in second i will never indeed forget you you are in everything i do later just hour angle top like a tattoo i will always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe you will get some attention star end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who is not afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but master and that is a b i g but copying billet a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stand out

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from bob dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not discord with the negatively charged opinion rendered bob bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that ha not check him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not cockeyed a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed bob dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this full cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a limited variation disco biscuit ma single for this charitable crusade his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer let the cat out of the bag those note a they were memorialize there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter
0	defective disc
1	amazing
0	meg of american listen to music on their ipod try telling that to this record label which willfully made this cd incompatible with itunes i do not mind buying music digitally but i also like to keep a physical copy of the cd for my collection copy protection doe not give you this option i am perfectly enrage and i feel like screaming avoid

0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son in law a a joke because it is all the star review crack me up especially the one from the holier than thou hard core dylan fan particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it lolololol the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself the star review are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read the review there for both camp hilarious i do not care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur you have got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop it is horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard even it is so horrible it is so entertaining i am going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a well a non musical friend i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him oh man i am listening to this a i type it hurt my throat so much just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the and while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big band incarnation woody brought a pretty decent band along a well even though he wa entering the last decade of his life amazing guy amazing version of la fiesta starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle shrieking trumpet a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamic a good a version a you will find anywhere
0	in the late s there wa a yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a of reasonably widespread album but they were not in the same league with yes starcastles arrangement were softer le articulate and their lyric were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace know star stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist but what wa the point i regret to say this but fly from here sound like starcastle it is yes light i am glad they are still out there working on new material but this is simply a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i posse this is for one of two listener either the yes completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop not a great album imo
1	wow these guy just get better and better and they work together so very well beautiful irish sound sing on

0	i did not realize that zappa rendering had more than one recorded version of peach en regalia the version on hot rat merit star this version left me greatly dissapointed
0	not what i wa looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definition and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature grievous so the star only express my disappointment in constitute what wa lacking also i personally find put down the lit music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantra when they are present and accurately read are music enough

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor pull unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nicety of this unequalled work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is free base on another company l p issuance of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why
0	a lot of people have praised this disk but i am not one of them this recording is many thing but the soundtrack it is not despicable me ha a very good film score frame by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also drop a line by him this disk ha the song that appeared in the film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disk because it only delivers a small sample of the film backcloth euphony and the score is a significant element in any film without the score all this disk doe is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you revel film score then this disk is one you should skip

0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good however sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby nash he lack the inspiration playing his band he need young to step up and him on stage to really get him with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe
0	sound quality is so low you have to try turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it it is a nice song though
0	evidently the title mere plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really do not know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from uracil to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the triplet plus year that passed between album that the group vocaliser songriter ryan bouvier had writer jam this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making mere plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar look distorted and out of locate and there are way too many softly ballad i think any trace of the false punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent effort packed with pop punk hook can for good be transfer now mere plan will spend the rest of their animation wondering if it wa the triplet plus year layoff between album or the change of sound style on this new one that belt down their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the triplet and a half year this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have bide a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered melodic territory perhaps uncharted melodic territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin near you decent next to all those old lfo album

0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far well the best one available from all the version out there it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it is a sin or can you forgive her the glory day vinyl group when all mix appeared either in vinyl or then cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la flavour say associate in nursing it to me stuart price version is nearly identical constitute to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best angstrom unit version of all the selfsame remixes

0	what the others say is true i bought this cd back in the early ninety i soon discovered it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp no stereo and one song play faster than it should i have the original mercury stereo lp all track were stereo except one just an fyi the stereo lp version of please do not talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released version you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube search for diane ray stereo
0	horrible do not buy it i would instead suck puke through a straw this is the worst song i have ever heard yuk
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a with her lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the originative and philosophical side to amount out high quality for an amateur send off but difficult to listen to
0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a if that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music it just suck really bad and medicine ha no love in it

0	when it ha came down to rihanna she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year where her voice ha lost it luster and she really ha not stopped for herself musically she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song her latest song diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course i really did not find the song to deliver a some of her earlier song had i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice i definitely think rihanna need to take more time into her song and not rush into making album after album year after year it really ha put a strain on her talent talk that talk wa awful and unapologetic is the same way song d

0	in general i dislike live for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day no should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a if that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion opera performance which i have to out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the force made in the studio and it off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant adding anything other than the same music again performance is routine all the way through having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the is an improvement on the studio recording the question in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the indifferently conceived but well played recording e in the of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue a blomstedt bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if last ounce of is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment the studio recording

1	love it jill at her best
0	once i would downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy the title track wa also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song not a sad one i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing

1	wonderful
0	t c elli had a brief role in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly wait forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the differentiate the first single miss thang wa good good enough to actuate me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else think back cassette single the pillow of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow jerky style on most of true confession it is possible that they stress to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample and pulsation the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent pulsation and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s knock on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
0	maroon ha joined the like of all the other modern day group what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike this may be fine for today youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value but for u old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice
0	meh
0	i do not understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today he is a cut above in the vocal department he doe not need to do this i am not a fan of his song selection and the direction he is gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where he shine in my opinion but i adore him and his fearlessness he is obviously doing what he love and just because it doe not resonate with me doe not mean it is not worthwhile i just wish he would do more ballad song with deeper lyric and let u hear raw adam in all it natural beauty
0	please do not waste your money on this recording it sound a though it were input to the computer sequencer without any regard to tempo angstrom unit on continuity a very un musical album

1	michael john poirier ha a soothing voice that match his sublime lyric i love two song on this album especially forgiven and the maiden and the messenger forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who ha an angelic voice i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it asking what i thought of the song i loved it the first time i heard it and have loved it ever since the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you hear it i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head the album is worth it for just these two song the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ drawn by a mutual friend

0	though i will take some responsibility i downloaded from itunes should could have listened to the sample my bad how can they use the same name a an already existing band and produce music like this while using that name really it should be an outrage i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for oh well i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness hopefully it will not come up in random very often
0	sum ha no gift they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible if you want something close to in good order in the pop tinny genre try new found glory the ataris or maybe older blink material this album is made for stupid tinny with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason it vote down me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no gift band pick up some afi or bad religion to truly see the real meaning of being tinny
0	i am trying to award this zero star but am forced to give it one careful most of the review here are for broadway revival which give high this mp is for the revival the london recording dreadful truly awful carousel a cockney accent and badly sung give this one a miss try any of the others you find here instead in fact this is so badly misrepresented by amazon by using the wrong review i am going to ask for my money back amazon issued refund within a day of my request and agreed the wrong are linked to this album they are working on correcting link if you arrived here from the link on the broadway cast revival cd page is not the mp you are looking for at least on rd
0	i am disappointed in this version of the song i can not understand the word at all the singer are not louder than the accompaniment so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the word especially in a christmas carol there is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty
0	not listenable you are better off just donating to get nothing in return
1	i purchase this album because i like the god bless the child track i have been a fan of joe augustine for several year will buy more
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them including this song i guess it wa worth the price
0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter
1	great sung song
0	i am not for sure what those who gave this or star are thinking this is awful i realize there will always be sycophant of certain band who are so enamored with them they will always rate star when it is painfully obvious star are not in order this is certainly one of those time this cd is hideous and that is being charitable i love old van halen they are among my all time faves but this who in their ripe mind can hold this crap star much le or dlr sound terrible reprehensible i will not even go into the sammy v david argument since i never really cared for the hagar year i love sammy a a solo artist but did not wish for his turn with van halen but i choose his mediocre turn with them to roth garbage now
1	an absolute classic in my eye
1	jonatha brooke ha of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard she is also of the most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather light experience person group take shape back in the early that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart wrick melody could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so a lot mine from story angel in the family and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so a lot mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true art the eye in the sky track from of jonathas solo album is an almost ghost rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time ghost her song stay and encounter in your head for a long time and when you regard her body of figure out a a whole i just can not imagine why she is not more popular some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion section that shit you want to dance while some of her song shit you want to cry she is that good i do not know what else to say write other than buy her music
1	i would ask people to purchase beyonce if they like this artist music is an individual choice and should be treated a such
0	this is not the rengades i am very disappointed it seems that all the renegade mp downloads have the original title but are not the song belonging to that title

0	the album is great so do not think the star are for that it get information technology lower star rating because it is censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled sufficiency explicit but one that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to one it jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this indeed album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people do funny not get screwed over i know i am not the only one sufficiency angstrom unit who had this problem and this is not the only album for which this is a issue again great album but buy the cd multitude so you get it uncut and skip the download

0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this new cd set with great anticipation when it immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u very cool there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste but must say this one wa a bust never listen to it and had we it definitely never have purchased it

0	there are many release of the world of nat king cole others with to song which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version this is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar you are better off skipping this one for one of the others
0	after i had hear david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could not even get through song before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i feel null new or even the slightest bit interesting about the medicine on this disc the song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the monetary value you pay if you feel you must have this i hint you wait a couple of year and you can get a used copy only fiddle once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollar lol

0	doe a self inflict hole in the head realize one a better player i thought not so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music scene it would not have continued to develop much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is dead because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true up backbone that realize honest player stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it is that is how easy duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared aboard jimi hendrix bobtail bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he is been anoint by his fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern player and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey johnny appleseed different cobain she truly could impart her voice for the oppress because she herself ha been oppress she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were title to traceys wail could both move multitude to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and any form of metal especially for younger multitude getting into the music scene if you read that and call for what else is there to choose from i think the you have given in to the medium already once teenaged discover kurt cobain they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so that there is nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana birthday suit i recommend tracey johnny appleseed the cranberry the b the beatles john lennon bobtail bob dylan the moody blue and anything else observational or unusual nirvana wa just lazy

1	one of his best and one of the best holy night version ever done
1	such a great tune and could to it all day blake clean version is just a good make all redneck proud
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a what is your name what really separate this the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel can drive musician to despair i think that the beginning the song it is easy to dismiss a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and he is willing to or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a time to really get it
0	i purchased this song along with other song and all but this one completed the download i tried to cancel this song order but could not therefore i paid for that did not download no way to try a second without paying for the again and taking the chance it will not download again oh well
1	the song is catchy and fun amy winehouse wa a very talented singer and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song
0	wa not aware that they were not the original chase after
0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer not much he gave it his all when singing with her but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album did not sound a though he wa giving it his all sorry
0	this review is directed at the vendor a opposed to the actual album do not buy from new chapter recycling this record shipped in a complain white cover and damaged at that rather of the original cover a seen in the pic ridiculous sending back and ordering from another vendor
0	amazon service and speed of wa the cd no longer will play only played it twice now no longer work i guess you get what you pay for applies here
0	the orchestral piece have a lot of blank noise in the background and many song cut off half way through
1	love dangelo and this song this one of those song you can enjoy anywhere sitting with your special someone thinking this is u or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying it melody doe not matter it just a great song d angelos style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy make me happy five star from me
0	unfortunately this album doe not contain of shanty which is a shame since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am the military these are very similar to our cadence since this album doe not contain all of them here the youtube video with of the shanty
0	this probably is not the recording of this praised song that you want go to the album i want to see the bright light tonight and try the song there first i think i bought this first and not understand why wa so often mentioned a among richard and lindas best just saying

0	so i know there are two dirty word in the song and i wanted the clean variation that you hear on the radio so i could listen to it even if my child pop into the board but instead of using another word like the radio edit this one u cartoon result very weird and just a you are getting into the song that pop up wish i wouldnt have bought this one
0	katy perry second hit song is very catchy but it is annoying it is one of those song you can not help but hum certain part to and the video just well is just there i thought lady dancing with the umbrella or whatever kinda cool the first time i saw it but i wa wrong this song is just the flavor of the week and when i first heard it i did not it it is gotten a bit better since then but do not expect this to win any grammies lol star
1	i like messianic music so this wa a treat comfortably for me many paul wilbur work but others a well
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus christmas is best song on the album and the only cover of the classic song it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas another vocal and quite charming it is one of my personal favorite the others are good too in the only dud go to nuttin for christmas is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with christmas carol can be a move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
1	i have listened to album probably time this morning i been a long time volbeat fan these guy bring it all to the table with this album trust me get it now
1	if you like chicago like christmas music this is the compact disk for you
1	this is my pick if you need route a song to get you started on a long road trip to fight vampire demon and werewolf
0	and i say that so slackly this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still lolly surface fluff i mean i can contract into certain song that are all pop and slight substance but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song that is what this song totally ride on at least chris brown even though it is a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better lyric nice video altogether i just do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in second i will never forget you you are in everything i do later just like a tattoo i will always have you claptrap claptrap claptrap claptrap jordin start drop a line your own song and maybe you will contract some attention lead end note beautiful voice but contract a young producer who is not afraid to strain something young and different i know it can be punishing being original these day in the studio because it look like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and that is a b i g but copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stand out

0	no banjo i washington simply disappointed by the overall sound i loved mumfords first album and remember the second one washington just a just if not better i washington very excited to receive this the first day it came out but after listening to it three time end to end i felt bored after the first week i accidentally left it in the player of my rental car when i returned it and made no exploit to retrieve it i hold out hope that the group make a th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two so terrific
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a low budget i love the thalia gave u amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to meet estefan and everything changed left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell single efort from emi i hate the fact that is always same latinada like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for cry out loud only one that is good and the only reason i gave her star is no me enseaste that of the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad besides the fact that she hired estefano to work with her i wa expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio with her star paulina but no i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there and i agree with the one who said that she need to wait to speak english fluently the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

0	this guy is terrific however this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content every song on one is on the other in the exact order and i bought both thinking they would be different really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title great performer probably a decent guy but let u take one of those off the market it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky
0	i do not hatred the music i bought this piece because i loved it for year and wanted to hear it reformatted but the recording i purchased is somehow scrambled ilk different track are playing out of order in some place not what i remembered at all i hope amazon can fix it

1	honey this cd
0	why wa the price so low all the track are mislabeled
1	i really wish they would do more cover this become into an amazing project for their fan thank you shinedown
0	i am sick of the crap played on the radio instead of great band like killswitch engage in flame a i lay dying lamb of ect now thats real music not this crap the only reason this guy even popular is because he got shot nine time in a few year rap will die just like disco then metal will rule the world once again
1	love their music
0	she can not even do a soft song without it being at the schubert or oneil theater i would advise you get the ala carte from her massive library here at itunes there are some great thing
1	do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i have not yet heard all of her s era release they are a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the fall into the pop and jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album two more of straight ahead rock because she is good at it and her voice is well suited it the hetero is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it is akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there is no track listing here i will do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus again traverse a chord progression unlike anything i have heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but here is where tanes unique voice shine through it is difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which both controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out even year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there is a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove start to finish ame to chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it is vocal over acoustic something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened if you have spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum drone buried deep the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda of zamza and judy and mary hibiki light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a instrument on an even par with guitar and but i am really really glad that is the case anyhow ame gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether that is incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song that is like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a that is been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it is unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum sound a little like solo john lennon this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your it is not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko or is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there is also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff she is done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not interesting a the rest of the song lead me believe it is of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo only a bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where the restroom and i love you generally in order and i have not sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated relentlessly cool tune i am far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune like from later album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still have not gotten around to getting her other disc if you like alt rock that is generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album take notice that all artist writer actor musician painter etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate artist like jewel have to project different image twenty four seven whether it is their look and or work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to accept but that is life nothing stay the same everything change however that is how the entertainment business operates too artist are product pawn of an industry that control their every move just enjoy the music and have fun
0	sound like rap and i do not precaution a bit for it
0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the year now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the question is have they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive second the two of them do not ignite in the heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pa this one up because four and five second feel more like wasted time overall song f

0	composition while ambitious and promising at certain point never really take off the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doe not go anywhere with it the theme never develop and the variation are not all that different from other i had high hope the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction however

0	what i simply in reality and always say is that when a artist ha one to come out with a song they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her washington music it actually ha not actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of taper tug you is honestly one of the worst choice constitute she ha made hour angle into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d

0	i know most of the revaluation here are from people that know danny or mind to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their revaluation seem a little biased at best the verity is that while this album unquestionably call book binding to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is very worth listening to more than once and very once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys vocalize doe not help matter much it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music very overpowers it it is too bad really if he had a stronger vocalize this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall forgetful of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you do not know danny but have always wondered what it would audio wish to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
1	love this song
1	awesome cd

0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never bear came out you think a track featuring garry shider skeet curtis and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier
0	first off i would like to say that i commend bejewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound it must get quite tedious with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an record album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i do not actually like this record album a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i do not get far in when i have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are pigboat standard they consist of poor lyric dodgy music and silly spell out this way is by far bejewel practiced record album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next record album bejewel is back playing instrument writing paying attention music and singing her heart out this record album would be a fantastic record album for a pres young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from bejewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and bejewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever you do not take to sell your body to sell record

0	mo when it ha came down to rihanna she advance ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the land constitute past decade and sadly the quality of make out her voice ha improving slowly withered away kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage be antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the year now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the question is have they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive second the two of them do not ignite in the heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan sole i would sincerely pa this one up because four and five second feel more like wasted time overall out song f

0	this product did not download properly a a result i had to download a secondly time incurring a secondly charge i wa robbed
0	this artist leaf a lot to be desired i actually tried to listen to a little scrap of this and and keep an open mind but i found myself not being able to get past the first thirty second it is the same regurgitate slabber that is all too commonly pas for music today keep open your money or get it on bootleg personally i would not take this for free add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thief cop killer drug addict and ex con not the kind of person for me natali if you are reading this i hope you make some near choice in the future
0	it is advertised a the explicit version it is not
1	this is one of my all time clock favorite song even if you are not a country music fan i would recommend this song well worth the price of the mp
1	beautiful love song beautiful voice i became a hartman fan a a result of this song
1	greate
1	i can relate to this song all sung the way around because my father passed away in and he including my mother information technology and i knew it wa his time to let go i listen to this song in memory of him
1	old school music the best from puerto rico isla del encanto bonita perla bonito san oceanic bonito juan buenos recuerdos del pasado
0	i wa told this wa happy music i find it boring depressing i am tossing it
0	i gave this a listen a friend of mine know i am a big fan of frank etc so he thought i would like this but like so many young guy there trying to sing like sinatra i am looking at you mike buble fail because they have no now technically seth is a good singer i do not particularly care for his singing voice but obviously he got some talent there i almost appreciate the era style the album cover i would like it more if they were not trying so hard to invoke the of frank old lp cover but seth ha absolutely no heart no soul whatsoever and this is what is missing in the singing of today anyone who think they can pull off singing doe and we are left with a glut of talented singer very few of whom i ever care to hear this is one of them i just can not take it it is singing no heart not to mention it is frickin griffin singing to listen to
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike and try to avoid about hollywood production terrible
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live on instrumentation i hope his next one will be great like he is on the road with his band
1	it is great i love the whole cd
0	not at non all what i expected kind of insipid
0	i heard a lot of good thing about this album so i bought it only become disappointed many of the song seem forced and repetitive if other hit they have had i have an honest listen several time actually returning it me wa that bad about the only good thing i can say is that blink ha an drummer
0	okeh
0	this album suck like the other star reviewer wrote it is all commercial radio garbage it is so overproduced it is hard to listen to i have been listening to the band since the late and if you want to hear good o a r you have to see them live or buy their first live cd if you like this album you are probably a new o a r fan or maybe you started listening or album back which is not a criticism but for people who remember them when they first started their change to this is definitely a shock sorry but it is what it is
0	never information technology rec it
0	dolt stupid
1	very good quality price delivery well practise done
1	i love this cd single song it is one of my all time favorite i feel like a couple of the song are straight out of my highly recommend
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording is often far from modern convention i personally think this one of the best that i have heard of sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein
0	not listenable you are better off just donating to get nothing in take back
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tune over and over again everywhere you go this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling and an upbeat tune i enjoy listening to this over and over again i would love to find more of these kind of new tune new to me anyway
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doe not sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doe not bother me on this album it is simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it is pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly is not the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doe not is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this is not at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let u take a look at each song the lord of steel start off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why is not eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it is like an incessant hum of tone and that is a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric are not good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i do not know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it is time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i did not download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre i am sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates it is own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he could not take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the ftw i will do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you can not argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too
0	the cd control system get superstar hand down the problem is that there are only track although the cd ha track is missing when you download it

0	im a big cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to cornell contumely soundgarden audioslave and totg fan everywhere this should be a justin timbercrap song
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it is a what pas hip hop these day people seem to be in love with weezys production than his lyric which apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all lil wayne is whack i am not a hater i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he is just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pa off a hip hop also the fact that people claiming that the album in the trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance my music

0	i did not appreciate his bit about joining isi
0	first off i would like to say that i commend jewel with trying a different and with a new sound it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i do not like this album a few i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i do not get far in when have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other are sub standard they consist of poor lyric dodgy music and ridiculous spelling this is by far jewel best album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she to have abandoned that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument writing thoughtful music and singing heart out this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever you do not need to your body to sell record
0	i washington told this washington happy music i find it boring depressing i am tossing it
0	a lot of people have praised this disc but i am not one of them this recording is many thing but the soundtrack it is not despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also written by him this disc ha the song that appeared in the film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc because it only delivers a small sample of the film background music and the score is a significant element in any film without the score all this disc doe is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you enjoy film score then this disc is one you should skip

0	this version of the song doe not sound recollective quite right to me make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument washington had so much of a screechy conduct sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck conduct with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an homo indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters

0	i very did not like the music i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have the few instrumentals were pretty good but the other selection were boring
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule whatever happened to good old fashioned church music i am serious this type of music known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music the piano nirvana wa not a good band the lead yeller committed suicide which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan if you are like me you will not even think about and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself a my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church
0	it is a good song but timber it is not a spectacular song this song is lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music i love gaga but not this song

1	i just discovered rosi golan o lucky me one she sings song of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare such longing so beautifully expressed innocent she u the minor mode in constitute a way that express this longing and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything that it must be real and true love and that such love doe exist all more or le the song are wonderful but i especially recommend come around think of me and indeed yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart energy department of real love thank you rosi

0	let me break this down in a preferably incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and groan heaven while rebellious offered nothing new or even originative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even sympathise with all the tortured soul out there but cobain did not speak to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan that is the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a heaven in espouse them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporaneous or true fan in fact by worshipping heaven you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destruct learn this and accept it secondly the music please contain pleading otherwise wa diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously should not need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let u simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the rest of the band member were also hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a comfortably thirdly an album immenseness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it show in what we now conceive to be classic is also completely dependent on the variety of sound and style which the album utilize time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other heaven album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan that is three strike heaven fan yep so i will leave you with a sapient word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it is not too belatedly to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a heaven cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heating system the mother of invention freak out or we are only in it for the money the fug the fug elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok calculator the bend or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant heartfelt lyric then pick up these album instead leonard cohen song of leonard cohen or song of love and hate wilco summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan highway revisisted freewheelin the time they are a changin blonde on blonde another english of bob dylan or bringin it all back home truncheon bragg william bloke or lecture with the taxman about poetry nick drake pink moon or five leaf left the beatles sgt pepper revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo louisiana tengo i can hear the heart beating a one or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or not traditional sounding vocal then you should listen to these album instead television marquee moon the flaming lip zaireeka yoshimi battle the pink robot or the soft bulletin master beefheart safe a milk lick my decalcomania off baby or trout masque replica billie holiday noblewoman in satin or song for distingue lover van morrison astral week the pixy surfer rosa morphine cure for pain or yes tom await rain dog or swordfish trombone jeff buckley grace or sketch for my looker the drunk you simply love a not bad

1	my economise loved it
0	no this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c is not a good a she wa on car wheel true i have always liked lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock her life ha not always been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it is a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumble but that is not really the main problem she ha always mumbled all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and strong it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel i have heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong there is even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad some review praise her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music it is the sound of old beer tired muscle and autumn rain it is the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job ha lucinda finally lost it have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had more than enough song to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and in a world where good and original songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one however wa just a big yawn to me
1	lie with it
1	mc flepp roman flepp from liricas analas rap in romansh sursilvan and swiss german i am not a romansh speaker i will say i am a student of so i find it really cool whenever i can make out small bit of the swiss german i think romansh is a very lovely musical language very pleasing to the ear and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue the beat are planned really well flepp ha a voice that imho is perfect for his music and every track on this album is out with sensibility he go through a lot of different style from mellow to jazzy very refreshing guest include liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoon on musica
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse they have really grown together a a band the song on this record are more upbeat than on last album but they have not the depth jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past the vocal are also much more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing this is evident on the track anchor wash and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric highlight on the record are sky falling am i ever gon na find out and take me however this is one of those album where every song is great and be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of album very organic and pure the song will leave you uplifted and help you be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen
1	all time great song by a great country vocalist singer great to play at th wedding anniversary

0	i have been jewel fan for a long long time i saw jewel before she became famous for piece of you and instantly fell in love i loved style her voice her word everything while piece of you will always be my album i still found solice in all the others until now what wa she thinking i fell in with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar speaking to the crowd with her song her concert were intimate when spirit came she added a band to her while i wasnt thrilled i could deal it because at least she wa still writing those deep lyric that made me shiver at time then about mo ago i went to see play and i wa so happy to see that she had ditched the band and wa back to playing with just her and her so now mo later i that girl gone completely i never thought jewel would sell out and write such bland on the surface lyric and pimp herself an audience that love poppy meaningless song of britney spear at first when i saw the video for intuition i could not believe it wa jewel then i thought well this song seems to be putting down those who sell out so i thought that maybe this song wa the only one of it kind on the album but it wasnt with the song intuition jewel is a hyprocrit because she ha sold herself to just cash

0	when it ha came down to rihanna honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year where voice ha lost it luster and she really ha not stopped for herself musically she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song her latest song diamond feel very choppy and voice sound a bit too course i really not find the song to deliver a some of her earlier had i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice i definitely think need to take more into her song and not rush into making album after album year after it really ha put a strain on her talent talk that wa awful and unapologetic is the same way song d

0	not happy this one do not know it wa my fault or not but download the song disappeared into the bowel of my computer and still can not find it
0	i listened to the sample this recording and wa struck by how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on and mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recording are back from a place of acceptance and reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is nor is she willing to curse god and die

1	oreskaband is a great one third wave ska band unlike most one third wave ska band they have a clear clean sound they do not blend in other style of music care punk or metal this is not similar to early ska or the two feeling era ska it is too peppy and energetic this album is good clean fun i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese there is only one song altogether in side most song are in japanese with a couple of line in side and a title in side the only downside is that the album is only minute long
1	i will start off by one saying that i am one of those completist type i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he is done and i have to admit this particular album get the most play you will know dwyer from his raunchy right on day of coachwhip fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it show it is extremely thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that it is much slower it is not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff with musical genre act a dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and wakeless pick up both yikes album right now they are quite short but angstrom unit they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer
1	xawesomehave heard this song done a number of way this by far is ane of the best

0	this album is horrible the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be put out to pasture i can not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problem david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa a such he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly he only sings half of the lyric the rest are spoken he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric he change up the tempo of the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward he u completely different lyric when a song break down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album wa released you will know what i am talking about that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that i have ever heard he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse i will sing it for you right this time in other word dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and i will wait which are the main reason i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love disappointment
0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet liquid body substance funny like most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical merit or tune to be find every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were indite by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only accidentally i suppose some folk would acknowledge that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling point trust me they aint

0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said the only place that ha the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of cd it sound a little thin to me but it the right version at least
1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz post bop and avant garde by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world barry altschul is superb a well and yes anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway although being an item for accustomed ear this is not to be missed by any real music lover

0	definitely not his best work song either to rap or slow nothing like his last album it ha to grow sung on me or a big waste of money
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day wa angstrom unit nice just to purchase the song i wanted

0	exactly just junk
1	musical perfection from the foo fighter a usual
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me west is some other great group of song
0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert interview are ofttimes ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial derivative control a if that washington the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and followup rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and disorder by dealing noise dog bark and child screaming if they infringe on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique social occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when so i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live seance is free of all these casual and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under followup is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same violence made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentaneous academic fashion is in violence washington recorded by davis in the context of a gross schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warranty without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all pointedness conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid bring of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he washington alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the interview instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not recapitulate but make their pointedness in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled on mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of life music lay down even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question clay in the end where to point these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording power be located in an arbitrary point near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e gm in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy saul steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable add up of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden leonard bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable point even if the last oz of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his i have bought and no in case you are wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it did not hurt thing though i will get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter that is the bad thing the good thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you can not move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood is not trying anything new here this is territory that is been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it is definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time
0	not clean still ha the formulate damn
1	a beautiful song a hymn of earlier day and who better to do it than fernando ortega the unmatched mavin review really should not be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose but rather an accident on someone part this song deserves mavin

1	this is not the classic chop shot tsfh that everyone is used tight to this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the forthcoming music in this album come from their first few argue collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and sort dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die tight on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we arm get from the light of the exactly sun a nasty burn now is not that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it is just fantastically brilliant

1	interpreter beautiful voice
0	i listened to the sample of this recording vertebral column and wa struck by how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not see this a a bonk song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship mr buckleys bear interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love bonk that bonk way again both of these recording are looking back from a place theatrical of acceptance and reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and past die
1	personally i liked the original version of the song from the movie but one i love this version best

0	wow this album is awful i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day royce too since the late budden is a great lyricist joell is dope he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year the first album wa really good some filler on it it wa recorded in day they took year on this album most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great so many quotables green lantern freestyle wa sick the mastering on this album suck period i am listening on a rega system where is the production from the alchemist they sounded great over just blaze production on the song with em they are trying to get into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly they pick the worst beat from these producer yes these guy can rhyme why can not they make good song unless they are rapping over someone el beat the single were weak but i expected that guest feature from cee lo singing that awful hook busta skyler grey never heard of her bob swizz and em wtf i blame eminem jimmy iovine and interscope record yes these guy deserve success but not with this album knick knack paddy wack how i wan na bone cmon joell these reviewer are saying they are bringing back lyric i am going to listen to the hip hop weekly series mood muzik the bar exam and pretend our house never came out and to that first review killer mike r a p music is the album of the year so far
0	a i began listening to this album two cyclist started chasing me down the street i got no action from completely this album at all
0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment and i despaired of having a flawless product the cd came through in perfect condition however i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk when i played the cd i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection so i will not be able to use it any longer for my walk unfortunately i had to open the package in order to determine this so i am out of luck a far a returning it is concerned too bad they did not leave a great product a it wa sadly it is not going to be my favorite any more
0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this new cd set with great anticipation when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u very cool there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste but i must say this one wa a bust we never listen to it and had we previewed it would definitely never have purchased it
0	horrible do not buy it i would rather suck puke through a straw this is the worst song i have ever imbibe heard yuk
0	i am not a big a fan of king los a i am of los when he wa doing mixtapes before suit king he wa the truth this album is a let down
0	this cd duration singe track audio recording song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound more often than not the audio recording is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and savor listening to it again envisage you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax
1	use to deliver morning newspaper to this on tape
1	angstrom unit wy i like all the cd because she wa the best of the best a a wife and a mother
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc are not bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fan overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette
1	emmylous voice is a good a it get here and i wa information technology amazed at the synergy between her and rodney these duet could not be better this album is stellar
0	i have been a fan of heart since but i must say this album is a stinker i reckon the sister wilson wanted to rock on this record sorry but i aint hearing it here

0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a sure sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the variant feeling like a aggroup of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and album i do not know how to account for that it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head i will come back to update this review if it grows on me

1	it is hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidate big star radio city get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior come to mind but the frontrunner from the ha got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shine in turn whether it is the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems a a group with no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music but were not sure where to start this one is can not miss

0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased couple of year ago delayed a my review may be it is sincere i am a fan of ultimate spinach i them of the best band of the bosstown rock scene i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris record i suppose i have asked them for a full refund but i somehow opted not to do it
1	love it

0	i bought this record album with an open intellect i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang back up you could barely even hear them this wa a brassy attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy this record album unless you deprivation to flush your hard earned money down the drainage

0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could not even get through song before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc the two song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple of year and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollar lol

1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies

0	there seems to be a concerted effort by number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it is going to be slightly more challenging decipher what is a genuinely great one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone i also presume therefore any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a service take the opportunity to listen to it first buying it the mixed review really do indicate this album is listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy my personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of early groban did with david foster i do not view this a a foster v rubin thing so this is not a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal listen to often however i not feel that he is done and yet at the same time i think he is charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when i would rather have left it alone i am aware that album require work to grow on you hence i wanted give it a chance but this is not happening sadly is the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and can not face listening to some of the track the nick cave massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn i am expecting to hear it booming out westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doe not flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it is to be so many thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be and a bad stereotype of what love is often written i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even if it miss the mark i can not face giving this one star because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i can not cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it is staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that i am probably not that close to to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a result of a thread on his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend money on listening what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him whilst all the positive review are very clearly not at merely the rating of this album many them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i it is only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves

1	old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i do think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and else that we currently use to and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can between each other point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is enjoying story and you can almost see them wink at each other when she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state know other region have great but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to story to keep others entertained the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are good and they a tendency to interweave from tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller for those of you who were not i can think of better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson

1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past year than dokken even without george without jeff and a weakened and at time embarrassing don this band is still one of a kind no matter the lineup dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release jon levin is incredible never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay levin is that good the first and last song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable don vox are not a strained a on lightning strike again he seems to have found a register where he can still sound smooth of course mark boals in the background doe not hurt but cheating is allowed at this age keep it going don we are still out there

1	i agree with concur the other reviewer that identical this is a very warm recording which is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more constitute objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein

0	not the saame same kimbra
1	leon cut up adding his own to some classic hank williams country tune the version on of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of album also you to hear his more straight up distinctive voice rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there is anything wrong with that it is just a refreshing change for his fan

1	my year old grandaughter had the volume up for hour while she played bear the cd she will be listening to it for a long time grammpa

1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album take notice that all artist writer actor musician painter etc etc have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate artist like jewel have to project different image twenty four seven whether it is their look and or work moreover change bear can sometimes be difficult to accept but that is life nothing stay the same everything change however that love is how later the entertainment business operates too artist are product pawn of an industry that control their every move just enjoy the natural selection music and merchandise have fun
0	great version of this tune this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason however it is fuzzy sounding and doe not quite play through to the end chopping off about second i will try to get a refund it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credit of the movie the visuals add more than you can know

1	excellent work of art she is on target with every song seems to relay a pervasive quality of record album despairing depression underneath the provocative bad girl image some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question lady friend this is a top quality production
0	am so disgusted with amazon this season of christmas are offensive explicit and revolting and it is even a week into december i saw that it wa lady gaga so i wa wary at first but i decided to give the preview a chance light me up and put me on top really amazon really christmas spirit includes carol wintery giving etc not sexual innuendo so disappointing esp after first great song by casting crown
0	great music obviously but awful remastering even worse than the cd chrome box sound thin and tinny like it is coming out of a transistor radio the mighty chrome deserve better but they will neer get it a longsighted a they are on cleopatra
1	i like messianic music so this wa a treat for me many paul wilbur work but others a well
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success practise with that gone my guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag nighttime in year while staying with andy kindler in his studio
0	this is the worst sleep euphony i have purchased from amazon it is just the same minute of euphony cycled a dozen time and the euphony is too intense for a sleep aid
0	i throw this a listen a friend of mine jazz i am a big fan of frank etc so he thought i would alike this but alike so many young blackguard out there trying to sing alike frank sinatra i am sounding at you mike buble they fail because they have no heart now technically seth is a good singer i do not particularly care for his singing voice but obviously he is got some natural endowment there i almost appreciate the era style of the album cover i would alike it more if they were not trying so hard to invoke the image of frank old lp cover but seth singing ha utterly no heart no soul whatsoever and this is what is missing in the singing of today anyone who think they can pull off singing energy and we are left with a glut of talented singer very few of whom i ever care to hear this is one of them i just can not take it it is empty singing no heart not to mention it is frickin brian griffin singing impossible to listen to

1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over past few the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it is own albeit one that is beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection
0	wtf is this trash this record album suck the weekend killin you
1	mr sandman is one of the few song i can sing gusto of course cange the word him to her but it work
0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here cipher is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are dependable however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the unit thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash he lack the intake playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this compact disk dvd and will probably put it stake in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe
0	not what i wa expecting quite the opposite of what i wa hope from this collection looking for upbeat and postive
0	although a nice album musically these mp track i downloaded were of poor quality probably recorded from an old vinyl record all track had click and pop while some had actual hiss and skip i know there are better quality album out there because i have one of them
0	not close to his best just pedestrian a money making pot boiler
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more constitute time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current premature i no more even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his angstrom unit very best album the most solid neer performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there angstrom unit is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his song have soothed be away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer go after and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it perfect tense wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very constitute becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability actuate to write some very moving song the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa angstrom unit me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an garner album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance constitute venue could lay the ground work for right on such an album yet there ha to be new hired man material to record album bring the album americium to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many hired man starry constitute eye grobanites who unsound are already gathering for the upcoming tour let u hope he performs heart only two or three song from this album while on tour and to the highest degree the rest pulled in time from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy
0	this album is leading because most of the song are unlistenable i do not enjoy listening to this album i do not recommend this album addy
0	the album is great the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa comfortably made for crosley and sound like isht oh well at least it look cool in white
0	sound wa terrible could not hera here actor speak because music is too loud
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the price it is offered i have no regret about this purchase
0	in the late s there wa a yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album but they were not in the same league with yes starcastles arrangement were softer le articulate and their lyric were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know star stuff galaxy and friendly first in the cloud but what wa the point i regret to say this but fly sheet from here profound like starcastle it is yes light i am glad they are still out there solve on new material but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i posse this is for one of two listener either the yes completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacy lengthy pop just not a great album imo
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part not a high point in an illustrious
0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist have not deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just are not a unique comical or lively aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game review on youtube i love bought i can not really recommend this album otherwise
0	they do not pay me to lie i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album what happen
0	the cd stalled halfway through the first song not satisfied
0	thie album is pretty good redneck crazy is by far the best song i would not buy music from amazon again have to use their player to down load and it is crap have to pa a year to add your track to if you have over
1	well done well done
0	on the the album is definitely not in the same league a a pat boone however i have found when played at medium level it doe provide for hemmoroid suffering
1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented a breath of air
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success with that gone my guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag in year while staying with andy kindler in his studio
0	seriously no wonder black people laugh at u i think it is time white people and all musician for that matter start bringing actual musician for the generation who may not know what that is it is people with rhythm and who pick up these funny thing called instrument back into the recording studio this synthesized stuff is too tacky for word it give me elevator and walmart sense memory i do not even think this is good enough for a musak award
1	dancing music from flo rida ha song lyric right round taken hour angle from an older song so if you liek the older song this one ha a modern twist hip hop
0	the killer were one of the spicy band out there they caught most mass with their large overly stylish music they also induce a mess of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the language fall off a wyrd in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and humor wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album crataegus oxycantha be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i unfeignedly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree large style that make him sound sooner state the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main trouble i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not exclusively a killer basher overall i pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flower voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
1	first class excellent
1	i really liked this album when it first came out one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor it is hard to explain each song can it is own even though david soul is best known a an actor director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one i do not believe you will be disappointed with this selection
1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented a breath of refreshful air
1	great song
1	information technology it is prince duh
1	prissy cd
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their splendid first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo turn out what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member have it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song i am for genuine say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought ease up u a special treat the tribal voice chant hela take u support to the primitive before the final nine a one half mo crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you will not go haywire adding this one to your library the musicianship is remarkable i can not praise it enough
1	love this song
1	such a beautiful track i come angstrom unit back and listen to this at least once a month

0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily accumulation song gone are the upbeat mix from s in it place stand a moody post collection befall notice fit for a stuffy vega of late lounge at am what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry between this and her self titled album from it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path do not leave your fan wondering what happened
1	i same it just what we expected
1	what a great song stefani is an awesome lead singer i always been a fan this never get old

0	this guy is terrific all the same this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content every song on one is on the other in the exact order and i bought both thinking they would be different really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title great performing artist probably a decent guy but let u take one of those off the market it hit this extraordinary artist look like either a business inexpert or sneaky

0	when it ha occur down to rihanna and kanye dame rebecca west their song have frankly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to get a song with paul mccartney i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice only one for kanye wa absolutely awful and not flush worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye dame rebecca west collaboration with paul mccartney four five endorsement is absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no interpersonal chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the worst song she ha occur out with and she need to really find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he ha only done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need much stronger for her next work and she wasted her own time with low gimmick song five hundred
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax
0	on this cd you will only find a of the original album skin diver suite side is not included too bad it is taken from vinyl not from the mastertape i guess for this price you could expect little more an incomplete vinyl rip
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country quite an twang and tranditional production the christmas song some other for example is sole rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a well hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to bear on the original sole santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it is one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute radiance overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here well maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and excessively her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
0	i could not download this i tried multiple time and reading of the help info did not help very disappointed
0	no skag at all
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a moo budget movie i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul en la intimidad love spittle sudor sangre too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina thunderbolt every ace efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en tu y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for cry out loudly the only one that is good and the only reason i gave her principal is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal but the rest if bad really bad a well the fact that she hired estefano to work with her i washington expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her principal paulina but no i guess the interpersonal chemistry between thalia and estefano washington just not there and also i agree with the one who said that she take to wait to mouth english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

0	i am so disgusted with amazon this season of the christmas are offensive explicit and revolting and it is not even a week into december i saw that it wa lady gaga so i wa wary at first but i decided to give the preview a chance light me up and put me on top really amazon really christmas spirit includes carol wintery atmosphere giving etc not sexual innuendo so disappointing esp after the first great song by casting crown

1	for what it is it is a great tune song by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic brilliant
0	it is a pretty song with great vocal but i am not sure about the lyric message once i downloaded and listened to it in it is entirety i wa displeased sound rather morbid to me not a great choice for a christmas song sure it ha a christmas y sound but if you really listen it is not about anything to do with christmas is it just me or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far i really enjoyed this day of free downloads advent type calendar last year i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest it made for a great collection of christmas song arrangement i wa not familiar with this year is disappointing by comparison
0	the album is great do not think the star are for that it get lower star rating because it is censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled explicit but one that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did think anything of there not being a label being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a a some swearing in it the censoring enough to ruin it i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people do not get screwed over i am not the only one who had this problem and this is not the only album for this a issue again great album but the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download

0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately and not for her music it ha been for her work with american idol and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split but for her latest single she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before and fails to do it on papi the third single from her album love the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career in fact hearing it now feel like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger good luck to jennifer on her other project but love wasnt really feeling the love at all with the exception of on the floor song d
0	the tune were mccartney the stack on each disc seemed awkward excluding disc there were song included that were to be honest pure junk tune i had never heard and they were poor representative of true the career i sir james paul mccartney guess it is a bit like any other mccartney disc you are lucky if you out of ten that make sense

0	when it ha came down to rihanna she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year blab where her voice ha lost blab it luster and she really ha not stopped for herself musically she ha also wasted later her spirit a practise well in her song her latest song diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course i really did not find the song to deliver a angstrom unit spirit some of her earlier song had i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice i definitely think rihanna need to take more time into her song and not rush into making album after album year after year it really ha put a strain on her talent talk that talk wa awful and unapologetic is the same way song d
0	on the whole the album is definitely not in the same league a a good pat boone album however i have found when played at medium level it doe provide measurable relief for hemmoroid suffering
1	this music and the lyric really are enough to encourage you along the way but the vocal are simply amazing and make it seem so easy not everyone can do this
1	good vibration
1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this hour long cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this will place you in the midst of vietnam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even in uneasy social climate of respite wa found in music there is the sunny beautiful morning by the rascal the bubble gum by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul mean i you by the this cd focus hit so if you are looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish build a thorough music collection from the s

0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son indeed in law a a joke because it is all the star review crack me up especially the one from the holier than thou hard core dylan fan particularly the one who face are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it lolololol devotee the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself the star review are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read the review there for both camp hilarious i do not care if you are a bob information technology give rise dylan connoisseur you have got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera singer like domingo trying to medicine convince u that he logo can sing pop it is contrast horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard even it is so horrible it is so entertaining i am going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a well angstrom unit a non musical friend i know they will howl with bear either delight or pain or both one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like unvoiced he hired them to totally mock him oh take heed man i am listening to this a counterpoint i type it hurt my throat so much just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed screaming man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present inward we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is atomic number a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice

0	clean sporting version
0	most of the medicine start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a showy type sound which doe not do well to relax a person who is trying to quietus of course the sample that are dedicate do not let you know that worst i have spent may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window amazon can do that with it is own money i will not purchase another medicine from them

0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy fix their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to demonstrate their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyrical number off a weird in a bad way and stupid plus the reasoned of peak voice doesnt fit out the song at all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly cryptic it is not an improvement i had mean that the killer should drop peak and now i truly believe that his voice is like a regurgitate seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him reasoned alright the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something cryptic and peak is one of the main problem i would hate to look him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer basher boilersuit i pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like peak voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty ripe it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	this is terribly embarrassingly boring i know that phil spector is not dead unquestionably yet but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he is been subjected to this rebel biker jagoff bupkis if you thought garbage wa garage you nowadays just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for an entire landfill in either case take my advice and head in the opposite direction in out of control is nothing more than disney music for the nowadays cutting to the highest degree set the stuffed toy market most definitely also constitute extends to the suicidal fantasy demographic cotton candy noose and jelly ha been oh i buried you today indeed
1	i like this song i love that usher gave a sweet one undertone to a dance type song i like just about everything from guetta
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit this urge on of late album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature i absolutely loved hellbilly delux batch and sinister urge wa all right but rob ha really angstrom unit gone downhill in my opinion a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired let it all bleed out is all right but i would take any track from hellbilly over it bring back the old rob zombie
0	i wanted pg version the one i bought had much cussing in it
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon i just wish precious stone would have went more to the woman horizon than the teen horizon if you know what i mean can not get in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave review puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it not trying to say precious stone should stay confined but just because record sale are lagging a bit energy department that mean an artist hour angle to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything precious stone seemed to want to tell apart u to rise above i believe some call that item horizon selling out did precious stone sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human point of view precious stone seemed to be telling u she felt in her heart i know everyones got bill to bear but some affair are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy fat record company we have one britney shaft we do not need anything resemble anther one i hope precious stone find a fashion to put a bit more spirit in her next album i would hate to think precious stone feel she need to serve her ego
0	great cd but the person i sent it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it indeed very disappointing
1	brilliant a always
1	phenomenal recording on th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd it command premium in the collector market and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician i remember when i had the track of this back in the that i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doe not come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format which i have done with many out of print vinyl album still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal play jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horn and string by evans two of the piece pasture and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill a well my favorite piece on the album swahililand is also the longest at almost ten minute and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horn and string before he kick in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on conga al ternating from left channel to right jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the tour de force it is the final track on the album and close it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the year and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal play jamal is my favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover sound better than ever

1	this more solid acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself constitute is only so so and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc are not bad although none of them seem constitute essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demo are pretty depressing one sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine one for most fan overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes newfangled an apparently tireless artist with adjustment a vast and varied palette
1	i still do not know what this song is about but there is certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the song the tune is catchy and the lyric are powerful if you do not believe me watch the video

0	i have been a dylan fan from way back and i am also a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what ha happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these song and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra best i am a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not recommended for dylan fan and certainly not recommended for sinatra fan

0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i hour angle first played it i thought something had gone constitute wrong with companionship my sound system after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that prove wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert pianoforte with someone singing along in ill service the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this wa also the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company
0	i would rather donate my money to a corrupt charity reason why cent is the best i can relate to his lyric in da club and pimp on the radio and mtv all which mean he talented he ha talent because he doesnt play any instrument
0	a disappointment compared to other beegie adair performance i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it
0	i actually corresponding instrumentals but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration also all of the song did not download with the album that wa the most disappointing maybe next time
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample very well i enjoyed most every song except take by the wind when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier a if i would heard it before i listened a few more time and yes i had heard it before it is a reworked reading of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album i listened to yannis reading and farishs reading most definitely copy from that song but not only that farish also put in the same clipping of minor laughing that amethystium u in their song avalon from their odonata album what is up with that unless there is well explanation for this copying the song take by the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me
0	i bought ti for my son who is a music major he loved it
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda flavour like i have uprise up with her euphony first off her vox is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but her vox is one in a million most people that came up around christinas clock do not fifty fifty compare in vocal range she had such a big vox for a soda star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first record album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own term and in her own word stripped is my absolute favorite record album of all clock she sang from the heart and great experience she took u on a journey of get hold her own vox in the figurative and literal sense writing her own song and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing she is ever serve career wise i do not eff what happened between them but she ha not been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though gage to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it did not quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic wa a huge run out fifty fifty though she had a couple of great song on it that pose overshadowed by truly horrible soda song lotus wa an fifty fifty bigger run out that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this record album which is why i collapse it star but they are nowhere nigh memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she need to retire from euphony or get it together

1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most voice have ever heard she is also one of the most under rated songwriter in the the story wa a rather short lived person group formed back in the early that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha is smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time haunting her song stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just can not imagine why she is not more popular some her music ha an almost latin to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance while of her song make to cry she is that good i do not know what else to say write other than buy her music
0	completely different than any of her older album if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit this is not the album for you

0	guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the set s never going back to georgia expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped gulf coast bound on their turntable working with blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second jim payne a a result the collection featured the general sound a the earlier lp leading speculation at least some of these track were during earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history i always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot strange mixture jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix track slow sundown can not get of and the instrumental magoos blue simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of percussion and pseudo jazzy flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on but i anyone to try sitting through the minute can not get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the the band taking a at a blue number in the column this wa the album shortest most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have been a pretty good performance the song kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus epic can not get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar war catalog and you will know this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and you will get a feel for this one technically wa quite impressive with lot of space individual solo but wa sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star group composition the instrumental breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ear it is basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman not help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz andreolli emil thielhelm can not get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested blue magoos are still active and have a web presence

1	great product great seller
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now i have go back and listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without motion is his very best album the most square performance from track to track illumination is without motion the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his birdsong have soothe away many stressful moment and mean solar day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted isaac m singer and birdsong writer yet this doe not variety the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never been free for it tarnish his previous acquisition i do not damn mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do damn his advisor and most of all the producer wrick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal winnow of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his power to but together square album and attach birdsong to the right performing artist for the right hit is without motion impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the power to drop a line some very moving birdsong the best unitary have been in collaborationism with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be aught le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let uracil hope he perform only two or leash birdsong from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous acquisition and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i wanted this album to be skilful than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of birdsong without motion his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of birdsong that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing fully well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of uracil to enjoy

0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the is that the man who for year had arranged for them groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in business wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to a couple of song about douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity the than actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to some a again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice their mentor who doe not necessarily take any more credit for their success than ra songwriting but sometimes is what a producer will not let the artist do that is just a important ya know
