0	i so much wanted to love this iodin album dylan a sinatra he must really believe that he doesnt sound bad but it winnow wa painful to listen to the off key croaking i love dylan and ive been francis albert sinatra a fan of frank for a long time the longing and emotion were somewhat evident but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i sea can drive along the ocean with my window open
0	wanted the song with the word this is just instrumental
0	some other balcony sacrifice they should be ashamed of themselves
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this record album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced record album in age by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a caboodle of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here hold fast out above the rest a the best song on the record album they all are a mediocre at best rating naught here is suitable of being added to the live set or suitable of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i corresponding when jackyl do cover interlingual rendition but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i care before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and give up the ghost already the same can be said for just because im drunk it just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a ducky of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this exhort by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this record album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way for sure the production is estimable but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper audio of metal too doesnt appear right for jackyl it sound more corresponding them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan cleave with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they for sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great naught here is suitable of being remarkable of a jackyl classic

0	what is the most vexatious about this set is in fact the come of material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to go forth track such a take it away ballroom dancing tug of state of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable

0	very disappointed by this which i will probably to only once ellings interpretation of most of these song just grate and his voice is nothing special his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous id have given the cd star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune a waste of money
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song the rest is well all filler and the record is only half an hour long so there are only about another five complete song track one is a reminder of maiden s number of the beast and track three is second long it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well piece of advice tape or download the single and spend your money on something else

1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest most beautiful cd i have in my collection buy it without indescribably beautiful intelligent warm and well produced
0	i wa surprised to hear that this strain wa secrete by another artist but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this strain on his album house rule
0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl album we have not so this is a cd set and load of track but many of them are kind of jazz style strange slack singing and empty intuitive feeling there were a few pleasant traditional musical composition but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there if you want to experiment it might be worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not commend this
1	granddaughter tonne love t
1	my mom love this cd i made her momma day
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son in law a joke because it is all the review crack me up especially the one from the holier than thou hard core dylan fan particularly the one who are their nose down at u critical one just dont get it lolololol the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself the star review are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read review there for both camp hilarious i dont care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur youve got to horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this of more entertainment value than listening to some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop it horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard even it is so horrible it is so entertaining im going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a well a non musical friend i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he them to totally mock him oh man im listening to this a i type it hurt my throat so much just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice
0	this is another case where le is more i found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i wa pick up in a deluge

0	im not sure when this cd wa released but it certainly is doe not contain the original version in fact im not even sure it really buck it that bad if youve never heard anything by them before dont buy this cd if you heard them before dont buy this cd ick
0	i dont know where else to complain about this but sung dynasty every time this song come on i cringe and die a little inside it got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song sir thomas more of all time aside from the fact that the song consists of line of lyric with no substance along they borrow the can can song and make it even more irritating
1	a beneficial song you don t hear everyday a great song for those who are in love for the first time
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song not bing it is still verison is just not bing crosby
0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never came you think a track garry shider skeet curtis and tyrone lampkin would have made something funkier
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here appear to think if youre stuck in the early s or tear mentality of cooper fandom then this album isnt for you but zcs is hard from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa the third of a hard trilogy of alices s album the others being flush the fashion and special force all tierce while they dont match most of his s album deliver the hard rock commodity while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one and only weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful pappa album
1	i absolutely love this singer artist she creative person ha quite a voice and she delivers in every song she sings enjoy
1	the song is great ive saame been listening to it for year it just what i expected thats the reason i bought it ive been buying song from amazon since they started selling them im going to copy this iodin and paste it to every song that i review i hope you do the same

1	i just love it the music is will done
0	i just finished from the cloud and there a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window medium player nothing the name doesnt even appear in the playlist i try to open them in winamp disc track canon play instead i believe that problem is caused by the file name path being too long window wont even let you rename them in the way update ive found a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring example is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you like but do not expect to be and lulled to sleep when it finished file repair solution a i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the take to get to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing music in the universe thats character right there which leaf character for the track name now let consider the name of one of non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for piano in f minor op ii andante un poco adagio mp thats character the total is character well the character limit just cant handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation mark thats character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual file go and chop out all the duplicate in the example given above youll cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if want you can back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will you a total length of character if you add the new file name from the example above which is character youll see that you end up with a of under the character limit of course one wonder why didnt amazon think about this and use reasonable album name and file name without duplication in the first place my conclusion given at least four of the are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least minute screwing around to fix the naming error imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if it free to begin with of course if youre really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them
0	comprise intro is ok lol
0	yikes i mean yikes what the are they kidding is this some kind of weird joke i couldnt wait to place my order for this long awaited live vh album and i couldnt have been more excited the day it arrived i carefully unwrapped it and studied the cool packaging no band pic though very odd and let it rip oh my god what were they thinking this is so freaking bad i think it just turned me off music period the drum are sloppy the guitar are surprisingly sloppy too the key are lagging behind the band the bass is solid though but please please please dont even ask about the vocal this is not the band i know and love regretfully i absolutely hate this release
0	the trail hear didnt sound like a mix i dont like downloading any mix i like original music these were all for my prom birthday party in november still will play the tune but not what i originally wanted
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i wa curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift i think that a song compilation would be enough and trust me it wa enough the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated patsy is also quite ugly and cant carry a tune after youre done burning this album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artist like shania twain taylor swift carie underwood dixie chick gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland
1	danceable
1	awesomeness love this song inspiring and heart felt i could listen to it all it make my heart so filled with the spirit

0	i think it a shame that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything like coffer coil or resound of eternity this is by far the worst cd ive gotten in a long time and the first that made me write a review the singer may be the worst ive ever heard even my cat cd sound better i am very bitter about the i gave out for this awful attempt at gothic music
0	nope no sale here but i know my daughter like this group
0	according evidence to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started winner when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised purportedly credit tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most invigorate significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the fountainhead listener is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also lawsuit happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in the saame business wa now out the door douche bag to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener output which happens to be the first trooper track id ever heard back when it wa a hit and one by of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really it got me released roughly about the same time admit some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the saami time than the actual quality of the reference product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a saame pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some as again this album represents a period of decline in relevance habit a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ra songwriting but comprise sometimes it what a producer wont let the artist do thats just a important ya know
0	dont care if it your birthday or not the song is dreadful she need to be banned from radio completely hide your wallet so you can make her go away
1	love it
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete song although he been his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have a bit naughty the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape could be categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a these borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous who can choose her future work on the basis these recording jim of my morning jacket ace his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the sound nothing like original basement tape which is probably best wa the other in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

0	when it ha came down to rihanna she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year where her voice ha lost it luster and she really hasnt stopped for herself musically she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song her latest song diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course peach i really did not find the song to deliver a some of her earlier sung dynasty song had i really didnt find it to drive into the soul of the voice i definitely think rihanna need to take accept more time into her song and not rush into making album after album year after year it really ha put a strain on later her talent talk that talk sir thomas more wa awful and unapologetic is the john l h down same way song d

0	this album is horrible the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be put out to pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance problem david lee roth think he david lee roth circa a such he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly he only sings half of the lyric the rest are spoken he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric he change up the tempo of the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward he us completely different lyric when a song break down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album wa released youll know what im talking about that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse ill sing it for you right this time in other word dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and ill wait which are the main reason i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime do not buy this album unless you love disappointment

0	this is a very superb piece of worship music except that it is cut at the end tragic end for such a fine piece slice of music this music is on a par with heilig by schubert sung by the choir of trinity college cambridge these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb cut however this one is ruined by being cut short at the end babble out before the music is finished
1	i bonk this album god bless you derek horton wherever you are
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song not bing crosby it is still a good verison it is just not bing crosby
0	what i simply and always say is that when a artist ha to come out with a song they dont actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her music it actually hasnt actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d
1	best song ever
0	unfortunately this album doe not contain all of the shanty which is a shame since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the military and these are very similar to our cadence since this album doesnt contain all of them here is the youtube video with of the shanty
0	it totaly amazing that this wa created what make sindel think that horrid classical march will sound effective when played very naughtily i might add on electric guitar the tone he us are more annoying then a cat fight under your sleeping accommodation window this is totaly unlistenable garbage that ha no merrit whatsoever this might well be the worst cd ive ever bought i hope this will be the total extent of sindels musical offering putrid
1	great album with a list of quality song
1	love this call
0	this album suck like the it other star reviewer wrote it all commercial radio garbage it so overproduced it hard to listen to ive been listening to the band since the late s and if you want to hear good o a r you have simply to see them live or buy their learn first live cd if you like this album youre probably a new o a r fan or maybe you started listening or album recently back which isnt a criticism but for people who remember them when they first started their change to this is definitely a shock sorry but it is what it is
1	great song ive always medicine habit liked crow so thats no surprise musical score youd think but believe me i wa surprised arugula to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k pax it wa so unlike the simply many other hit she ha released over the year the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you wont be disappointed
0	not a great a his previous cd some tune but mostly a disappointment i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an best suit you
0	i have been a huge winnow of chicago for the past year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album care many windy city fan i am partial to the classic windy city that peaked in the early seventy these were the metre in which the isthmus had a diverseness of style and vocaliser robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however a most fan know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty so unmatchable might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement he didnt contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if you watch unmatchable of the windy city concert dvd or get to see them live you will agree that this isthmus still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the lastly year robert lamms solo acquittance subtlety and passion s p is an excellent effort and in many way it seems more windy city than xxx why couldnt robert have economize some of his material i e someplace girl for this newfangled acquittance instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the isthmus that cetera did there are some funky mix here but what are they they sure dont seem too windy city and then there are the horn everybody experience that the windy city horn gave the isthmus it trademark distinction while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single these guy are talented musician they dont involve to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why
1	this music reminds me of presage the early album of gary numan mostly because of the instrumentation used i like the science fiction theme and robby garner vocal prodigy ha become one of my favorite and i really like control

1	is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason song to die on halloween is hand down the song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the sun a nasty burn now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it just fantastically brilliant

0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now wife laurie anderson both are spectacular artist and musician i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album it seem this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone lou reed play electric guitar laurie anderson fiddle and john zorn sax the producer obviously told everybody to improvise if you have of all time listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect the result is essentially white noise unlistenable definitely for completists only and dont bother to pay the idealistic price from dealer here a short internet search will reveal that it is still available from the stone webshop this limited edition will take some time to sell out
1	the first cut is the deepest is a song written by cat stevens originally released by p p arnold in may stevens own version originally appeared on his album new master in december this one is ok but cat version is the best
0	the creedence clearwater revival album gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group i strongly believe this t j s album ha it way beat at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras classic a usual it just the rest of the group really ruined that album i couldnt find one worthy song on this messterpiece dont get me i love most of t j s other song but this album is just so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr if you count tommy james solo hit draggin the line then theyre tied bottom line is ccr wa classic album group and t j s were strictly single group
1	this isnt the princess music youd likely expect it better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this a good addition to change thing up a while still being soothing and calm i didnt give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are and a bit this fine to listen to when youre awake but arent a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those song the others great i loved the price on this and it wa definitely worth it
0	not that good it a split off
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse record album isaac seems to have lost his touch or his will to create masterpiece
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson

0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want operating theater to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago helium but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford gob jay demarcus brett along james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the require band are no longer capable of making music or roughly the producer think so require if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band ampere play you have to listen to lee gang thornberg trumpet james james i matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum john brockman drum and listen to sung dynasty the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i hold out wa not paying to hear him and his other friend doh he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had unfaithful wanted to listen to all those other people represent i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i dont mind if listen i dont like the song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the producer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write do and record it own music ampere only a name to milk a they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow decent be alike better for the sound out album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he put on ha not let wishing keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play winnow drum on of the opine song this is power a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say inwards he is proud of the boy he seems simply to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry trusted them under the work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after a record album thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do extra another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable variety from any out take from any ampere only of the album from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for information technology a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece altogether here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who made the song and iodin totally who played them sung dynasty and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some striation good playing by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album and good production buy it and love it
1	since i grew up in extremely remote part of alaska i may be one of the few people on planet who wasnt very exposed the bee music in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely from a mix album of parent and i had no idea who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the and stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting bee gee album this is where i came in naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice id ever heard in my life from that moment on bought every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that wa his range never failed to delight and lead on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously the huge album from the seventy didnt interest me much despite their danceability voice is highlighted fortunately i managed get hold of his solo album often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he hadnt been shaped by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the song after his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album come the closest to proving that just listen to dont cry alone if you dont believe me and while many of the track are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyric and vocal and i love that us his terrific from one to the next i especially love it when he in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely so well naturally you love robin gibb or the bee gee youre going to buy this album if youre simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one if not the most haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice

0	it pain me to see many star review coming from dylan own fan base have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is a some stated but it is an embarrassment record released it in the first place and in the process dylan now vulnerable that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa should have been released a a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing note a they were recorded there come a everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program clowning monologue tv show around u skip skip and jumping from view to view or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne oscar palmer robertson stress through her story of the little thing that go on around her that humor is a very valuable trade good that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to put across and while storytelling can be from one person to some other it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a put down of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home to me southern teller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great teller but there is something about the south that ha made the realm retain it storytelling supremacy some may suppose it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a fantastic and gifted teller like jeanne oscar palmer robertson while all of m robertson atomic number are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon river you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two missy north carolina and her husband left brain work to her fashion story of fall apart a pashmina fantasy wrap in new york in closing let me suppose i wa blessed to have have been advance in the south with it great teller but for those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a overlord teller than southern style by jeanne oscar palmer robertson
0	probably the worst excuse ive heard for a musical no actual music or taradiddle and the lyric are just jejune at best doesnt give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art

1	aim hype
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard adequate ha finally found a niche of it own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings adequate fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well worth posse while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can set about moderately brutal the quality is mellow from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your solicitation
1	i listen to the mp s for enjoyment but also for training purpose on the guitar so it go without saying that quality is predominate

0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn decent and song from guidepost vinyl album we have not so this is a cd set and load of track but many of done them are kind of jazz style strange slow singing expressive style and empty feeling there were a few pleasant traditional piece anthem but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there if you want to experiment it might be worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this
0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in the business wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track id ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some as again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ra songwriting but sometimes it what a producer wont let the artist do thats just a important ya know

1	wa a year satiate with mixer unrest and the music in this hour long cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham dean martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of viet nam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and dean martin luther king jr but even in the unquiet mixer climate of respite wa found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow trip the light fantastic soul lay lalah mean i love you by the delfonics this cd focus on the hit so if youre wait to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the s

1	this is a great session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of bebop ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha cha this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat once again great rare music like this is only available a an import although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen classic album which i purchased for about im so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic session of jazz available affordable for those who like timeless music such a this one by jos papa lou who still today blow circle around those much younger more acclaimed by the critic expert than he

0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain point never really take off the composer relies too accept heavily on totally a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doesnt go anywhere with it the theme never develop and the variation arent all that different from each other i had high astatine hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the sealed same i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction however

0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i dont agree that this is or star material performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle the live performance on crossroad and the production quality is not great cant really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when doe that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue

0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection even if you like sinatra youll be disappointed in dylan interpretation if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it very dismal not good for elevator music

0	this type of music doe not follow the rule whatever happened to good old fashioned music im serious this type of music known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet i had to whip my son my leather belt because he wa playing this of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano nirvana wa not a good band the lead yeller committed suicide which a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan if are like me you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself a my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church
0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment and i despaired of having a flawless product the cd came through in perfect condition however i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk when i played the cd i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection so i wont be able to use it any longer for my walk unfortunately i had to open the package in order to determine this so im out of luck a far a returning it is concerned too bad they didnt leave a great product a it wa sadly it not going to be my favorite any more

0	the record wa criminal record warped
0	first off id like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound it must get under one skin quite boring with recording the same type of euphony all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an record album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i dont really like this record album a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i dont get under one skin far in when i have to cut track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they dwell of poor lyric dodgy euphony and ridiculous write this way of life is by far jewel best record album i believe it signified a new rockier edge to her euphony but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the following record album jewel is back playing instrument writing thoughtful euphony and singing her heart out this record album would be a fantastic record album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is in reality credible bequeath this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever you dont need to sell your body to sell record
0	im not sure who came up first with the ridiculous track listing for this set but ddamn s really pretty sad omission here new slayer fan start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog this is a waste
1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past year than dokken even without george without jeff and a weakened and at time embarrassing don this band is still one of a kind no matter the lineup dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release jon levin is incredible never thought id say this but i almost dont miss george the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay levin is that good the first and last song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable don vox are not a strained a on lightning strike again he seems to have found a register where he can still sound smooth of course mark boals in the background doesnt hurt but cheating is allowed at this age keep it going don were still out there
1	great album for the linkin common park fan
1	i love novel the new cd
0	not a fan skip this each time
0	ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the you have the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite while but once i ripped it to my using eac my ear started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over before end the review i must that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is unmastered floating around it essentially the same mix without the volume level up to the point of over compression and distortion drum particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there
0	love greg hate this song own to this one should never been recorded should return it but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button lousum

0	let me break this down in a sort of incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true devotee in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the euphony please kibosh pleading otherwise wa diluted unwell constructed and almost whole lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i besides seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the relaxation of the band extremity were besides hardly virtuoso so you can end in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it point in what we now reckon to be classic is besides whole dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling devotee thats three strike nirvana fan yep so inauspicious leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regard a better musical path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if unrivalled exists heed my call the world will experience a unplumbed change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the prototypical american stand for then you should listen to these album sort of the velvet hole and corner the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out out or were only in it for the money the fug the fug elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesic kid a ok computer the bend or seminal fluid to the stealer you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love affecting heartfelt lyric then pick up these album sort of leonard cohen song of leonard cohen or song of love and hate wilco summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan highway revisisted freewheelin the time they are a changin blonde on blonde another side of bob dylan or bringin it all back home billy bragg william blighter or babble out with the taxman about poetry nick drake pink sun myung moon or five leaf left the beatles sgt pepper revolver abbey road white album rubber soul etc yo pelican state tengo i can hear the heart beating a unrivalled or and then nothing turned itself inside out you love heavy rock euphony and feeling angsty or contemplative or love gruff or not traditional sounding vocal then you should listen to these album sort of television marquee sun myung moon the flaming lip zaireeka yoshimi battle the pink robot or the soft bulletin captain beefheart safe a milk lick my decal off infant or trout mask replica billie holiday lady in satin or song for distingue lover van morrison astral week the pixy surfboarder rosa morphine cure for pain or yes tom wait rain dog or swordfish trombone jeff buckley grace or sketch

1	song i grew up with
0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw run and hide it sound like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o k album i rated it star because there wa no star all of alike come out the song sound the accept same and all of them are terrible i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note really but it wa still bad if youre wondering this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the one we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cd
1	i have followed lea since she first appeared on glee she ha a voice that so powerful and i am happy to see her career continues to climb

0	the tune were mccartney the stack on each disc seemed awkward excluding disc there were song included that were to be honest pure junk tune i had alike never heard and they were poor representative comprise of the career i guess it a bit like any other mccartney disc youre lucky if you out of ten that make sense
0	love waylon but this wa a little bit of a dissappointment

0	they play this song so many time when this came out and gosh will he ever go away he overrated and need to work at mcdonalds cause no one lovin it
0	what is it with this guy will he ever have the gut to release another album without a greatest hit package tagged onto this new material this guy for year ha re released the same old music the one time he didnt with a million budget invincible only sold million copy in the usa even though his million budget wa directed to only marketing in the usa why doesnt everyone go to cnet com go to the downloads section get yourself a free mp cd ripper then get jackson first solo album or really any of his album make copy of them then burn your own cd of your own personal choice of song that in a nutshell is what michael jackson ha done for year he know his new stuff cant stand on it own so then we need greatest hit package tagged on or just release box set number one etc etc i have never seen another guy live off his past more then him word to the wise get yourself a free mp cd ripper rip your already owned old material and make your own cd with different selection because that is all he is doing
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive person mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocal are very short but are still better than the frantic noodling that base on ball for solo on this short offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no instruction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzle blue guitar
1	love babble out anything josh sings
1	there are really only a few thing in life we can simply count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the song are simply a catchy a ever and shoot in truth out all the light contains a great call and enamor response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesnt change with smashing the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit life story the grand finale a cover of simply the rolling stone sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song i wa blast smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming gifted this album striation is pretty much perfect and this band need a in problem the u s so i urge you if non you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

0	this is b the purpous of digital music is to choose what song you want sung dynasty and not forced to buy an entire album
0	this is a rather strange compilation the individual track have little in common other than that they were made for movie this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track this mixed bag ha very little going for it it would have been far better is theyd selected the track in some manner it would have been far better a a collection of music from early film or of more recent film a it is it is a hodge podge that i really cant recommend to anyone
1	youre the unity is an award winning song and just to get that song is worth the price of the album

0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented in many different aspect he wa creative and every time i listened to his other show i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field this album is not creative nor funny it just hateful mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop fireman and snitch are a well a fart and enema joke go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy because you will not find it here
1	smashing great
0	lost and unequalled
0	no banjo i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound i loved mumfords first album and thought the second one wa just a good if not better i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out but after listening to it three time end to end i felt bored after the first week i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it and made no effort to retrieve it i hold out hope that the group make a th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample distribution very good i love most every song except dribble by the wind when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier a if id heard it before i listened a few more prison term and yes i had heard it before it a reworked adaptation of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could recount you album i listened to yannis adaptation and farishs adaptation most definitely copy from that song but not only that farish also inserted the same clip of child laughing that amethystium us in their song avalon from their odonata album whats up with that unless there good explanation for this copying the song dribble by the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me

0	clicked on this to a fault too quickly before noticing it not the original
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ear it basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	i wa in my record album twenty when i first listened to this originative album it made a very poor impression world health organization then but i thought id go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique brain soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming psyche provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit vox robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb jim morrison the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at slice hold out least in the thirsty instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative unequalled vocalization angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy information technology gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny power im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize all over anything doorsian about accept them despite appearance this review isnt about bashing closed book the surviving member require of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect brilliant and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed operating theater something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew require out the best in krieger manzarek and fifty fifty densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and ampere stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if sung dynasty you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a primal simply creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without originative him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest

0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a recent press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist which im guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label name just a list of the song and not in the order that theyre on the cd im not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a higher register steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same go for dirty world the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss altogether handle with care make it a a slower tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i would think he rocked but a whole record of this one guy is murder and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise id label this for completists only but im a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could get back

0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and album i dont know how to account for that it may be that in today market most multitude can preview an album before they buy it so they arent likely to end up with something they dont like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical theater tributary of american popular music soul gas constant b rock folk etc like ccr in the late s they are post out a musical theater territory that most artist brush off and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is strange to be hotdog this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole affair for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more sentence but i will because i incessantly try to dedicate something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nada attracts my ear or stick in my head ill come back to update this review if it grows on me

0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace when her voice leaf you assumably asleep for minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect a the fire in the fireplace fortunately it wa only a cent wasted expenditure there are some good sleep aid recording available but this is not one of them

1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album isnt for you but zcs is solid from beggining to end with catchy melodic phrase and interesting word which at prison term border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the word this wa the third of a solid trilogy of alices s album the others being flush the fashion and special push all three while they dont match most of his s album deliver the hard rock commodity while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one weak moment for me is the painful root word from the class of i am the future which should have tilt u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album

0	for a while it seem that taylor swift could do no wrong even out those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she create captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even out prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm pretended when she came up with her just to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom of solomon that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seem that she ha finally gone out of fire her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at just creating a brobdingnagian change of style that deliver to the mainstream bubble gum drink down princess drink down with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are rum and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be abominably disappointed swift ha not grown with her thorium album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is volition to throw up her hand and enunciate awww how cute the trouble immediately lead off with her first single we are never ever getting back together the form of address of the song is already bad sufficiency but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart matte up song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even out worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let just enunciate that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca bootleg she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely innocent of any poetic element and consist of plainly girly talk at one point she even out croons i enunciate i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely fill up of nauseating beep like ra e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album miss any kind of astuteness or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly self centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any embellish that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even out worse relocation wa to invite other manlike isaac merrit singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other isaac merrit singer the difference is distressingly acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out shine swift squeaking like she is a unsure sing along audience in the background there ha invariably been argument of swift genre whether she can be conceive country or just drink down and it didnt topic because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really enunciate that shes still country her album isnt even out good drink down perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum drink down and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her just new song ha been safe and sound with civil warfare many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are rationalize in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being self centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too practically of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of topic is the populace is pen of practically bigger thing than her

0	i wa counting down the day to this album being released i listen to sturgills first two album often and couldnt wait for new stuff so i buy the album on release day and start listening what the heck is this the st track is ok the nirvana cover is absolutely putrid the rest of the album is just boring and generic huge disappointment
1	david broza is an amazing talent loved seeing him get a line live and wa thrilled to purchase this cd
0	uninspired garbage such a disappointment i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out i couldnt be more unhappy uninspired is the best way to describe it it seems so half assed when compared to their previous album
0	the album is great so dont think the star are for that it get lower roll in the hay star rating because it censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda angstrom doesnt tell you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled explicit but one that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus suit i didnt think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean come out comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people dont get screwed over i know im not the only one who had this problem and this isnt the only album for comprise which this is a issue again great virago album but buy the cd so you get volition it censor uncut and skip the download
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only hope that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion drum in particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there

0	i have not listened to it due to technical problem
0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i couldnt help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year older most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you dont know that play over and over again to imply the listener didnt hear it the first time the final you dont know conclusion with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer dont shed away your money and if it on the radio alter the station
1	love it
0	this album suck like the other star reader wrote it all commercial radio scrap it so overproduced it unvoiced to listen to ive been listening to the band since the late s and if you want to get word good o a r you have to take in them live or buy their first live cd if you like this album youre probably a new o a r fan or maybe you started listening or album back which isnt a criticism but for people who remember them when they first started their change to this is definitely a shock sorry but it is what it is

1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy dark birthday for loop topology jfk it even above artist that silent night one that wa re huge covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior through song
1	powerful very upbeat song
0	i dont understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless in the pop today he a cut above in the vocal department he doesnt need do this im not a fan of his song selection and the direction he gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where he shine in my opinion i adore him and his fearlessness obviously doing what he love and just because it doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean it not worthwhile i wish hed do more ballad song with deeper lyric and let u hear raw adam in all it natural beauty
0	ok skeptical a i wa i gave it a try for a long a i can stand it and after two semester of daily listening while doing homework and studying this music ha perform nothing for me
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam tank music in the past ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd the great thing is he didnt try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate for the lady tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u lol
0	this digital copy seemed to be poor quality i purchased it after listening to it a a trillion time on on you tube and it just doesnt sound the same excellent song but ill proceed to use the the youtube version
1	great song
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd then dont even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium brood metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a accomplished letdown trivium ha such an awful sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood ambition of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down please for the dear of insert your select deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium
1	i have to say is that rick ross ha been thru the up and down of ppl coming at him and dissing him well this album back every thing up rick ross is coming off real nice on this album teflon don the album is more of an chilling laid back more kind of an album song like free mason is rattling nice track over all the whole album is a worth of a pick pick up it right the drake album drake ha a good album to a well maybach euphony is i real nice track to see to it out to guy go get this album

0	nothing unseasonable with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer manoeuver out it hasent changed in like year so any live set you choke to see or buy by ac dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to get ho hum and if you buy one live set by this band it all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet hit package or live album get ho hum

1	it is awesome so glad a cd came out
0	i bought this album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with tsung dao lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang cover up you could barely even get a line them this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more various audience by bringing in the big gun but those big gun were cipher more than smoke and mirror do not buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down the drain

1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live carrying out of this song this guy ha a real magic to him his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison he will create center contact with just one person and for just a moment but you can tell that that person isnt likely to forget that moment

0	huge wz rz this album is a bit disappointing some have equated it to an ep and i agree i believe rob is believing any crap he put out there is cool well it aint love john s playing and hope rob put out more serious lyric and music next time
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord this cd is astoundingly well crafted every note seems perfectly placed the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music generally this is soft warm lulling music but it doesnt put you to sleep toxic girl is catchy jangly and rhythmic without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it there is a real soothing quality here though that cant be denied fan of low and air should be quite pleased
1	idealistic this angstrom is ideal music for easy listening it play spend a penny well a background or for intent listening eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well her song are well chosen have depth meaning fortunately she doesnt try to showcase her entire range in each song like some other talented singer such a celine dion whitney houston mariah carey this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended information technology listening she outshines almost comprise all other female vocalist her cd are hard to find so if you see one buy it you wont regret it i would love to see more from this artist including original work
0	uninspired garbage such a disappointment i have been with manowar since their first off album and have been waiting for this one to come out i couldnt be more unhappy uninspired is the best mode to describe it it seems so half assed when compared to their previous album
0	i feel like a traitor totally saying this but i wont be buying this set any time soon i stand second to none in upwards my affection for the band but unfortunately this career spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last year of experience that recording career ala by my count there are only about five song on this set that were released after not good enough capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is totally a whole lot heavier on newly gathered song and a whole lot lighter on the re re retread
0	did not purchase this book either or whatever it is did not purchase this one can not rate it sorry
0	i had no idea what they sounded like but once i downloaded song i thought what a of time dont bother unless youre a fan certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon

0	hurt my head im too old for this at for sure
1	sung dynasty great song
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however a most fan know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty so one might ask what wa i expecting for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement he didnt contribute a single song robert contributed very little too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent effort and in many way it seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for this new release instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mix here but what are they they sure dont seem too chicago and then there are the horn everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single these guy are talented musician they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately and not for her music it ha been for her work with american idol and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split but for her latest single she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before and fails to do on papi the third single from her album love the song isnt really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career in fact hearing it now feel like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger good luck to jennifer on other project but love wasnt really feeling the love at all the exception of the floor song d

0	this is b the purpous of digital music is to choose what song you want and not forced to buy an entire album
0	ive followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album ive been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and drum ive bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what youd hear a disco very disappointing i wont buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric is the verse chorus to the title limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you youre limitless nothing too hard for you youre limitless there nothing you can not do are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

1	one of my son really this song and think it star for sure
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas album they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selection accordingly youll notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but big name produce big fear and so we have this piece of musical garbage a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention
0	mediocre execution compared to other tribute just didnt enjoy these rendition the same way i have other vsq performance
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would angstrom be worth a listen i wa pleasantly surprised from the first listen i felt i could follow the neer story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming some of the tune i couldnt wait to play it again

0	the song is not being sung it an orchestra playing the instrumental given it not what i expected i rated it star but if youre into orchestra and instrumentals you simply may love it could play it at bed time
0	i know i should have read the information closer so my fault but there is only one song on this cd one song i wa hoping to hear more from this talented artist i wa so disappointed
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a very miserable impression then but i thought id go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers greco roman level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history outstanding rock band what i require from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most pop piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve require the song by and large to levelheaded distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i require what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded amazingly mind blowingly banal absent even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title a lot scream low brow averageness im horny im hopped up seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite show this review isnt about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided former armed force too a lot pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about clearly a mystery how could people who wrote or cooperate on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so former armed force is that jim morrison bring something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his uncomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly a lot needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clearly and starring vision of what they were about musically a fat world where their musicalness could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison record album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage joke a pretty brass goosebump producing vocalization and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy bacchanalian force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest

0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after delight his sitar electronics work ive tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style so far ive had only moderate success hybrid fart that name should have been my first clue if were even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or angstrom german im not so sure it even an okko bekker recording front i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i didnt look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can minute in the opposite direction the music struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find comprise a good successor to sitar electronics let win over me suggest anything smashing by saddar bazaar jolly or orient squeezer a far a i notice know there are alike iodin release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please death alike please leave me suit the information in a comment to my review
1	it wa just what i wonted to the t the sound wa great and the cost wa ok wish it wa buy one get one
1	i heard this gentleman sing on huckabee one night and i loved his voice i immediately went to amazon iodin to find the song and get it
0	the album is great so dont think the star are for that it get lower star rating because it censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doesnt tell you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled explicit but one that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan now is roll in the hay basically a clean comedian and thus i didnt think anything of there roll in the hay not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon world health organization need in front to label something a edited or censored so people dont get screwed over i know record album im not the only one all over who had this problem and this isnt the only album for which this is a issue again great album but buy the cd so come out you get it uncut and skip the download

1	how can your toe not tap to this one mar strike hard it out of the stratosphere again
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to most current i pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist i listen to more over than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid album and song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban have the to write some very moving song the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring album a level that alters the musical stage where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work to pull album unlike any other in the end this is just opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let hope he performs only two or song this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your i wanted this album to be better than any of the album my hope were high why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this doe shine despite the haphazard collection of song make up i now look to his album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy
0	thie album is pretty good redneck crazy is by far best song i would not buy music from amazon again have to use their player to down load and it is crap have to a year add your track to it if you have over

0	she even do a soft song without it being at the schubert or oneil theater i suggest you the ala carte from her massive library here at itunes there are some great thing
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse although second album known to be difficult i beleived the band to have promise how wrong wa i is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of on no name face it all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way but there is no melody on this album worth writing about i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you like lifehouse because name face trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band switchfoot vertical jimmy eat world even the calling whose album i think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere

0	bought this for a client
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to grampus a theory that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really slap dont know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and life history manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the three plus year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block entire this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple plan sound take a breather like a boy band even when they try to rock out the accept production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album doe which were decent effort packed with pop punk hook can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the accept direction rest of their life wondering doh if it wa the three plus year layoff between album or the change of sound style on this new one that killed soil their career and the answer is comprise neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that forthwith will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a information technology little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin near vocalize you right next to all those old lfo album
1	love it
0	a lot of people have praised this disc but im not one of them this recording is many affair but the soundtrack it is not despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the accession of a number of song also written by him this disc ha the song that appeared in the film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc because it only delivers a small sample of the film setting music and the score is a important element in any film without the score all this disc doe is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you enjoy film ton then this disc is one you should vamoose
1	this is not the greco roman tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are tranquillise fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few collection such a shadow and nightmare ash tree and dynasty there is a much much darker evil fret sound it the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever intellect the song to die on allhallows eve is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb knock about and bake what do we get from the light of the sunlight a nasty burn now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it just fantastically brilliant

0	nothing wrong with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac dc ha the same setlist save ii or three new one to support the album they are tour behind for me this lean to get boring and if you buy ane live set by this band it all you need well maybe ii if you want blood from the bon scott era and ane of the brain johnson era live disc they still perform well but hearing the same birdcall over and over on every boxet hit package or live album get boring

0	i have bought music through information technology amazon preferring them to itunes because angstrom because itunes try to control their music too much however after the latest mp purchase i find it now amazon ha made it a difficult a possible to download their music to my itunes bye verify bye amazon i guess im gon na have to go back to the itunes store a much a i hate to
0	i guess the best way to key my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the onetime chicago kind of like the miami dolphinfish i expected them to overlook for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning some other super bowl same here with chicago s and s with their intense musical and political statement and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is besides sorry they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not look very matter to in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i besides think that wea now and former label had originative control for this project well i am certain they will aim some hit from this minute bug out song for the ipod are the name of the gritty today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting natural endowment the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too forged
1	at first i thought this wa a keith urban but i wa surprised that it wa jason mraz but i allay love it

0	dazed stupid
0	if you are a tango dancer or d j looking for a rather collection of ahead of time the most danced to tango in either the u s or argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hit instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost nigh never want to play at a milonga calling the collection all important essential tango is misleading at best avoid it
1	i stumbled upon lp searching for vinyl record on youtube and nearly devolve over when i started listening she is absolutely incredible and ha affected me more than any artist in year
1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best live show this show is special for quite a few reason fathom one being only one of a few band christmastime to play position the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run if you were a member of storm the warehouse you could have roll in the hay gotten both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last release sound issue live in new york this release sound amazing and on a side vocalize note i could not really hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the show start with an explosive you might die unbelievable trying a great way to start thing off dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave life time and even bt the second song you can ampere tell this is a special night for the band and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a nice surprise for relinquish the fan trusted that go represent straight into yet another incredible and like every fan know dave and the band take hold of always re invent the song there is so much energy in this show it really feel like youre there in the crowd after the incredible two step dave surprise yet again with the beautiful accept christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop if youre a fan just buy because you know it good if youre new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy still prove that after year they have forever no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if youre lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer im sure itll be the concert of a lifetime

0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage i cant not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it sound like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doesnt compare to his first album
0	in the late s there wa a yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread invigorate album but they were not world health organization in the same league with yes all the same come out starcastles arrangement were softer le articulate and their lyric were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know star stuff novel galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist but what wa the point i regret to say this but fly from here sound like starcastle working it yes light im glad theyre still out there working on new material but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in haze over preference to almost any other yes album i posse this is for one of two listener either the yes completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a great album imo

0	there are many release of skitter the world of nat king cole others with to song which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version this is a chopped down version of the album with adaptation the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar you are better off adaptation skipping this one for one of the others

1	this song is very special to me a im a gallant navy wife any song that honour the military is great this song wa played at the funeral of a very special navy seal it always brings tear to my eye
0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an s thing to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge

0	i agree with the two other review alone saying still song is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the whole comprise thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he matter should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash he lack the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar inwards and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for front a repeat playing once in a while maybe

0	i am a vocal man so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean during my era of music it wa pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def leppard pour some sugar on me no college class to figure out what any of those song were about and i guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now
0	i cant figure out why this song wa so pop in the first place only thing i can tell you is stay away from this one worst song in the s period
0	sound like rap and i dont aid a bit for it
0	this song wa absolutely horrible it wa very distasteful and lacked social organization i do not recommend this song for anyone in fact if every cd nick lowe made exploded i wouldnt have a trouble it terrible do not buy or get this song warning warning dont buy
1	this record album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with a pop edge to it with a very high level of musicianship dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acoustical folky song amazing songwriting musically and lyrically

0	t c elli had a brief part in bridge deck prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first along single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced woefully flowing rapping style on confession graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow decent choppy style on most of true confession it possible that they decent tried to emulate the success of tone feed locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic front dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension begin of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track prince on the album not enough to save the album however

0	doe a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not so let drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music scene it wouldnt have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say thats what it is thats how easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he been anointed by his fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to choose from i think the youve given in to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so that there nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b s the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change instrumentation this album is just a or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would longer be metallica if a band switched to trombone and tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instrument dropped the authentic folk real instrument keep in mind hate hipster and went with what can only be described a a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a proven that they are anything but doe the lead singer still sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if this wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby but like i said before this like going from joshua tree to pop they should have from u
0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be buying any more nor is this a worthy example of trip hop imo this is way overrated i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day yet i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker pimp becoming x etc there are a few good track but for the most part it a mish mash maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length repetitive running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster speak get dull fast ya know getting a few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doesnt make a good record

0	i dont know if it amazon fault but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp is bad too much treble muddy in the midrange and the bass is lacking or maybe it just overshadowed by the treble listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ear literally not figuratively hurt im so thankful for program like audacity sound manipulation program so i can balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to

1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a early batch of old lyric from accept his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pass air the lyric to longtime totally producer specify t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he been making his likely own record bob dylan since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis exploit costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and angstrom making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric attract costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a along anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that limitation he had some france hodgson burnett assurance he could finish loose the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an world health organization equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch word into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film refinement tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens marry and sung dynasty marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the helium record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of marry my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound angstrom a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for plunge the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

1	perfect
1	adele ha a howling way of arranging and singing song this one is a great example
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it it classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal best track is dig but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended it a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape
1	exceptional album amazing
1	best trump song ever
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use string for the main line this us brass and fathom brass for the aside or archetype iodin counterpoint it had a faster free base beat with a drummer who drove i the tune and gave distinct accent this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement no more of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of governance the man from pallid uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are archetype no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing system hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling
1	great song
1	this is one of those perfect single it so simple but so close to flawless dave gahan vocal even the s synth keyboard sound all work to create a flawless single that still to this day stand the test of time a must all around

1	jonathan sprout performed at my school when i wa six and my mother bought me a cassette videotape of on the radio i listened to that videotape until it finally broke after year and year of rewinding and replaying so i wa delighted to add up across the digital version of this album on amazon
0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no le onto the music the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better contestant on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just dont even begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke
1	love it
0	this is him singing a a younger artist still havent been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song still an awful and tear jerking song though

1	first came out in a this wa the band second lp maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that this garden of delight pressing ha an added bonus song tune i liked best were the title track back on my hill stick in your eye and the seventeen minute judgement day faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original member heinz mikus guitar vocal and horst stabenow bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change they released several more effort rock lion hard breath and gold n glory check em out
1	nice song im not a big fan of old school country but this one not bad a couple time in the song the lead vocal commonwealth is a bit wobbly but she recovers well
0	this is the lowest form of music it following a predictable and waning formula ive listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me ive listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpet to entertain me

1	it definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz post bop and avant garde by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the s and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world barry altschul is superb a well and yes anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway although being an item for accustomed ear this is not to be missed by any real music lover

0	i dont know if it amazon fault but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp is bad too lot treble muddy in the midrange and the bass part is lacking or maybe it just overshadowed by the treble listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ear literally not figuratively hurt im so thankful for program like audaciousness sound manipulation program so i can balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to

0	the remaster is terrible like so much music remastered these day for mp player it is completely oversaturated so that the sound is compressed and distorted and there is almost no dynamic range sound file look like a brick this type of remaster is what give digital sound a bad name and people long for vinyl it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster but this is not one of them boo

0	lee morgan quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling the brilliance of his tone is there but his idea have not yet been fully developed plus cliff jordan playing the senior side man on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to altogether a a maiden voyage this is just a mediocre record lee wa to make his mark later one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent written by bassist eddie higgins otherwise there is little to recommend here two star

0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this wa also the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company

0	this cd length sear track audio recording song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i cogitate it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio recording is good and somewhat relaxing until the someplace near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew mortal wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax
0	they chopped the song off the original song is the emended song which appears here wa chopped off at around huge disappointment and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing
1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market blur frank black cranberry the posy jellyfish and others whats not to like the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance guitar mostly of a quality so good you will be amazed too bad that in the end suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist

0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album bluntly speaking it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single then stop searching for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul i heard killing time on a community channel on cable it wa being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon relinquish prime music what happened to free
0	im not sure what those who comprise gave this or star are thinking this is awful i realize there will always be sycophant of certain operating theater world health organization band who inwards are so enamored with them they will always rate star when argumentation it painfully obvious star are not in order this is certainly one of those time this cd is horrific and thats being charitable i love old van halen they are among my all time faves but this who in their right mind can give this crap star much le or dlr sound terrible reprehensible i wont even go into the sammy v david argument since i never really cared creative person for the hagar year i love sammy a a solo artist but didnt care for his work with van halen but i prefer his mediocre work with them to roth garbage now
0	yes this album should shut up all those that say require that steve harris is iron maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion prof that he cant achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself he doe need the other recount guy also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard taylor for the album ampere the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle im not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and gotten a decent singer difference of opinion even blaze bailey is a good singer he didnt iodin have the energy record album and the leo the lion connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron maiden requires but blaze bailey can sing i dont know who told this richard taylor that he could sing

0	see jewel cross over obtain from her folk country root to pop laced with heavy beat and keyboard this album fails to ignite and record album feel labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener i love jewel but failed to find anything dense in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing affair overall i think that she come out will look back on this one with regret

1	this product is simply a recorded for each second interval of exercise and second of rest for a total of cycle
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little little girl cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their setting of experience not that id want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal ingathering i get a bit of the heebie jeebies

0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal dont sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people are paying money to buy a and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song are great but the remastering wa entirely pointless

0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some folk would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling point trust me they aint

0	i listened to the sample of this recording and wa struck comprise by how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made alike her interpretation i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after longsighted a long relationship mr accept line of work buckleys interpretation is of comprise a iodin young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and die

0	sound comprise like it wa recorded during tuesday night music club i know it wasnt and that is not my favorite era of hers sound sorta been there done that hope the rest of the detour cd is better
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at rating nothing here is worthy of being added to live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a that is just meh not a song i before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be for just because im drunk it just a watered down version of of the bottle i dont get why some already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed rock me roll me jackly me off in any sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope and jackyl can still bounce back but they sure not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
1	thanks for getting it to me on time and a described got ta enjoy doing this dance

1	r kelly by far ha left the r b wanta be in the dark r kelly ha produced hit for some of the biggest name in the musinc industry to come out with a album that totally switch up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing this album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really want to hear music go get it

0	maroon ha joined the chemical group like of all the other modern comprise day group what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike this may be fine for today youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value but for simply u accept old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate and his voice is nothing special his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous id given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune a waste of money

0	yes this album should shut all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden steve may be the main composer in maiden but british lion that he cant achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself he doe need the other guy also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard taylor for the album the difference between bruce dickinson and this is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle im not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should known fan expected of him and gotten a singer even blaze bailey is a good singer he didnt have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron requires but blaze bailey can sing dont know who told this richard taylor that he could sing

0	dont understand why adam want so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today he a cut in the vocal department he doesnt need to do this im not a fan of his song selection and the direction he gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock where he shine in my opinion but adore him and his fearlessness he obviously doing what he and just because it doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean it not worthwhile just wish hed do more ballad song with deeper lyric and let u hear in it beauty
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and upwards talent so when they put out christmas album comprise they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selection accordingly youll notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection legal injury were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but big name produce big fear and so we comprise have this piece of musical garbage a many have novel noted the only piece that work at all is slice must be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high consequently simply level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention

1	this might be the best intersection big bad voodoo daddy ha ever released every song is fantastic in this cd they mixed new orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that though it distinctly big bad voodoo daddy give it a fresh sound the lyric are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful in addition the duet it only took a kiss is gorgeous i had vision of fred astaire and ginger rogers dancing during it
0	it either badly make out or just a really bad idea elvis voice strait rough i dont recall thinking that when i heard his original recording it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it take away from his greatness rather than enhancing it i wont be buying any more of the song from this record album i have been an elvis buff since the first time i heard dont be cruel and hound dog played on my radio over year ago re release more mix of his master if you must priscilla but please dont do anything like this if i can dream record album again and no duet either it just disrespectful of his memory
1	i mind can listen to this one over and over again
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i wa curious so i checked her out skirt desire i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift i think that a song compilation iodin would be enough and trust me it wa enough the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound rather really dated patsy is also quite ugly and cant carry a tune after youre done burning this album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artist like shania twain taylor swift carie underwood dixie skirt chick gretchen wilson reba mcentire sung dynasty and sugarland
0	dont it doesnt have vocal track in the mix it a straight up repeating beat when i previewed it i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample distribution after all it list all of the knocker in the artist column wrong wrong i just spent a buck on half of this song thanks a ton whomever hail up with this idea
1	while clearly a tremendous technical achievement information technology this cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression both explosive and contemplative i love it
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album entitle malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo raise what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish cornet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six tenacious track provides intense hear if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite organic structure movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love call im for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to cod master copy album you wont go wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i cant praise it decent
1	all of phyllis hymans song made me cry even this one attractively sung www k mille net
0	this is just terrible song period it just bad it really make little sense it wa written to elicit a heart felt response but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle register track and were co written by vitas track and written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd it hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of a vitas like many performer especially those from distant land is plagued with pirated disc play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad wheres you there me kuda ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoe dont keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat try not dancing to this one i dare you in short and a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor in this one street of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in this one just techno sound and the voice a instrument
1	this is the music from the opening scene of the movie layer cake wherein daniel play a fascinating role a a middle man for a recreational medication group in uk concept for a movie and the music grab your attention also
1	destiny of good vocal to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low bank note of some of the vocal it got so low at time i couldnt really make out the bank note but i liked most of the vocal and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some vocal all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well done really enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and the old beatles birdcall if i strike down in love with you very listenable and very relaxing
1	i love hawaiian music i used to own two hawaiian cd but never really liked them this cd is incredible and i will always listen to the song when i am on the beach

1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent til now discover all of her s era release because theyre a short difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer any wa trying to nudge her into altitude rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back scratch with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin out rub a dub then dive into an fantabulous somewhat angsty greek chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive discover before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and afterward some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice reflect through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same prison term but that comparability preserve stand out out at me yet year after i first discover this disc cut the yield is a short smelly a short jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove between verse line and chorus there a meet gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge deck then back to that glide groove then a rideout greek chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt final stage just an fantabulous groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing curt of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge deck is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much prison term listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried thick in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and moon on koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto mark how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an yet par with guitar and vocal but i am really really beaming thats the event anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a fully grown whacky smile on my face every prison term i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord frame in jimis wind cry mary whether thats incidental or knowing it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the weighty part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song thats like a devout short journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explode in anthemic chorus then after a abbreviated acoustic bridge deck turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and someone into the vocal to final stage on that same soft a a feather shoe it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first prison term today til now will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving receive of your lifetime a song thats been with you for year that family is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all prison term faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker scratch with tanes sly vocal over piano and get up that sound a short like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album more often than not because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your adult female i wan na be your adult female it not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a short annoying and the bridge deck is just weird and not in a good way kakekko dash or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge deck kage no naka no kage fantasm in the center of a fantasm is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an fantabulous relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is some other jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a rub a dub with some funk flavor instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a short fleck beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the public convenience and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric washables with tanes voice processed through a thin out radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are good luck into sluggish tempo groove that are in reality more powerful and striking than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but unrelentingly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i like from afterward album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s disc if you like altitude rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive gravy holder lynchpin of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely prison term well spent
0	be warned she went creative pose iscreative i first had star but went to two lol
0	i did like this version of this song but since this wa free i guess i not complain
0	stevie is constantly good

0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda like ive grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time dont even compare in vocal range she such a big voice for a star who didnt get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world she could do on her own term and in her own word stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she sang from the heart and great experience she took u on a journey of her own voice in the figurative and literal sense writing her own song and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing ever done career wise i dont know what happened between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic wa huge fail even though she had a couple of song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it star but they are nowhere near memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she need to retire music or get it together

0	the killer inwards were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win sung dynasty some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyric come off a forthwith weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa comprise better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be comprise slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly angstrom believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan missed fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing look to with expectation and i did not hate ampere their last album so i am not solely a killer basher overall i grampus pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the non are the best thing ever eer you know you are in love if you like flower voice p s while the bettor vocalize song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their astuteness to deliver the good some more fan but in doing this they depict that null wa there the lyric come off a weird in a forged way and stupid asset the fathom of prime voice doesnt fit the vocal at all the illusion and wit wa better than null plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop prime and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him fathom ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and prime is one of the main problem i would hate to fancy him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have mislay fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha null to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer basher overall i enunciate the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like prime voice phosphorus s while the song when you were young is pretty beneficial it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	this album wa a huge letdown it is way too melodic and popish commercial light rock being a huge fan of all that remains owning all of their other album having gone to their show this album wa a major disappointment melodic can be cool if it is still heavy like on their older album but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me i dont like the direction they have gone in i liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it wa dissatisfactory i dont recommend this album to hardcore and metalcore fan

1	she always a star to
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really dont know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the three plus year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent effort packed with pop punk hook can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three plus year layoff between album or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin near you right next to all those old lfo album
1	for most of u who are familiar with bob baldwin body of work the latest release all in a day work is brilliant the opening song a new york minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic baldwin if you bobbaldwin com try playing funkin for jamaica and then can you feel it from the latest release both are vocalized by tonni smith for anyone in doubt please you are to go back and give brazil chill another listen youll be glad you did thats all i have to say brazil chill is just a brilliant a the others i am building up my collection of baldwin until have a many a i can get if never seen bob baldwin perform this is the icing on the cake i can attest to that he is a true professional a skilled artist and band leader and fantastic performer
1	an excellent series with a theme that genuinely capture the feel of the series definately recommend especially to lover of the series
0	far too sappy vastly overproduced where is the rawness and fire of the earlier day a tremendous dissapointment the only good thing about it is i dont own it a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic boy did i ever get the short end

0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul paul mccartney i thought this wa going to be a full grown crash and burn with their voice only one for kanye wa absolutely dread and not level deserving the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul paul mccartney four fivesome second is absolutely very low pitched for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the rack up song she ha came out with and she need to really find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need much stronger for her following work and she wasted her own time with low pitched gimmick song d

0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review east why would you say such a horrible thing call pac wack thats blasphemy right there he wa a very a it father he had rather a few positive song and he wa one of the greatest anyone would agree with me there on to my review of this cd i weep at the current nation of hip hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop ha taken a huge souse in term of it lyric prowess and it pathetic cent doesnt help one bit yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson on going multiple time platinum but why did this album sell so much i think it wa based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he wa shot nine time and lived to tell i mean anyone who say is a lyric beast is totally assinine this guy is so predictable let see if he talk about selling rock he will probably bring up something about glocks in the next few word and if he mention hoe he will probably bring up about him doing show and if he mention you get my point he is such a bad lyricist if he came outta the south id understand but coming from queen ny is observe a the breeder of lyric genius but is trash catch talking about how ja rule is he circumvent u up and had u shot and stabbed youre the wanksta cuz u never get under one skin back at him this album father it star because the beat are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the advantageously but this guy living off of his shooting story i love how people gave him the name and called a snitch cuz it true new title for this album get or die cry

1	liz ha had a rough couple of year with that being said she ha come out the other side stronger than ever with more of a blue shake sound and hard living lyric exodus of venus is her best sour to date
0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is closer to second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a of non talented performer who seemed to sell million of were in bad taste musically this cd take that to a whole other level
0	service and speed of wa excellent but the cd no longer play only played it twice now no longer work i guess you get what you pay for applies here
0	katy perry second hit song is very catchy but it annoying it one of those song help but hum certain part to and the video is just well it just there i thought the lady dancing with the umbrella or whatever wa kinda cool the first time i saw it but i wa wrong this song is just the flavor of the week and when i first heard i didnt like it it gotten a bit better since then but dont expect this to win any grammies lol star

0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed to top it off the theme included in this album are dull and flat
0	i think this is her worst song ever blah she is so talented i cant fathom why shed write such an incipid song a this
0	i bought this album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the like of the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang back up you could barely even hear them this artist wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun doh but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy this album handsome unless you delight want to flush your hard earned money down the drain

1	i dont think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining first rate diverse introduction to the endless repertoire mozart perfect for someone who is only a fan of classical music or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background

0	alright this song is actually so horrible that i couldnt help really myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you dont know that play over and over again to imply the listener didnt hear it reexamination the first time the final you dont know end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer all over dont throw away your money and if it on the radio change the erstwhile station

0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this work the mind problem come when you are looking for something delight else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well exceed overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the record album drum early will soon be disappointed to top it off the theme included in this album are dull and flat

1	nice to be able to download an old ace song that trigger old memory instead of buying an entire album
0	the tape wont play it drag ive tried other inwards tape in the same player and have no problem
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or take heed to him producing an am blab show and have a certain affinity for him their review look a little biased at effective the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic wine way possible nothing here is really worth hearing to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song youve pretty practically heard all of it no refreshed or exciting film here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter practically it not strong enough to be a lead so the generic wine music really overpowers it it too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic wine old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean hold out for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better suffice looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
1	this is one of better collection out there some very hard to find song on this wonderful cd set come in a very nice hard box cd which is rare these day multi cd set case flimsy and fall apart quickly not this one this is a bargain it seems the previous review wa for the wrong cd
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to corrupt the actual certificate of deposit ive always liked dj phantasm and wa interested to hear what sort of beat he wa making now in it is typical phantasm ambiance and found sound but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like a few track attempt a dubstep feel but it come across a plodding a couple selection even have some gob high hat pattern and tripleted pattern those actually sound the coolest the part that make me absolutely dislike the album even though part are ok is the rapper in the pink track that state that trump ha sex with his youngest daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wan na lose half of your audience moby just did the same im selling all his cd now a he mouthed off too about trump
1	jerry playing wring so much feeling out of every note and everything he play is so tasteful and rich yum
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instrument they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instrument keep in mind i hate hipster and went with what can only be described a a fake sounding electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if this wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung baby but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to pop they should have learned from u
0	far too saccharine the original fleetwood mac version wa sweet without being saccharine and is far far superior unfortunately that version is not available a a legal mp download im allow with the option of buying the cd of bare tree for this song
1	another solid song from the skillet album that showcase their softer side while this is not nearly the side if skillet i often listen to is good enough in it own right rating
1	this concept and music dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever the music is phenominal who would have expected le estimation and the live acoustic and cd dvd package is direction an off the chart idea in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way
1	i thought it wa fabulous i am the same age a barbra and knew she wa going to be something exceptional the first time i heard back when this is her best yet

0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canada self proclaimed alloy queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i bid the nowhere rock genre i like la spill the bean and la p demonstrates her talent but everything around that is a great disappointment from the gap note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been read in a gravid underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly read but mostly pointless it music without melody or purpose and even though some of the transcription are at time but rarely tolerable you wont be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of invariable direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous album since theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or alloy queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional lee aaron
0	this wa a single cd and if i would have known that i would have not ever non purchased it thanks
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave track such a take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable

0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range he sound rather screaky the title track wa also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow cutter seduction song not a sad unrivaled i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing

1	my little boy will listen word to this song over and over great way for memorizing scripture
0	if you are a dancer or d j looking for a collection of the most danced to in either the s or argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hit instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc you would almost never want to play at a milonga calling the collection essential is misleading at best avoid it
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war this song and it word are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience and a ignominy to the troop especially those who have served in combat per this band intelligibly troop in combat have no moral or self control and were mostly just complacent killer
0	this guy is terrific however this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content every song on one is on the other in the exact order and i bought both thinking theyd be unlike really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title great performing artist probably a decent guy but lashkar e toiba take one of those off the market it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky

0	im a big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the blame around it been a long time since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it it just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding im aware live is live but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio im really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit i think this wa just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved im still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this one aint gon na cut it sorry
1	we lost this wonderful country singer way too young his song calm the soul and lift your tone he will be missed
0	most likely not the song you remember check the preview first

0	ive down loaded this two time the song doe not work on my computer i have had similar situation with down loading music from amazon they have refunded my money sometimes but why doe ten song down load this one doe not
1	what an awesome collection of relevant artist on this cd something fresh to hear and my favorite bruno mar is featured on one of the track if dont want to buy it to support the producer artist by making the purchase at least a few minute to listen to the sample im guessing youll want to download some of the track to add to your personal collection many of are that good
0	i am very disappointed the phraseology on the description claim respective artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original s artist it is not it is a mix sung dynasty by a wedding singer sail line type of band is it even legal for a cd to be published with remake of original artist song without the permission of the original artist hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song very misleading and disappointing
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five time along marvel and nothing really stand along out the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the neer lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the best song india ha done metre aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red sung dynasty star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but information technology this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some good makeweight lyric from piece the original the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler india message just do not resonate with me on this album she roughly actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin back to the middle video and nature in the future
0	im a huge matisyahu follower and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like ill keep it simple this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream i like the song sunshine a lot but sunniness the others just reexamination seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect it pretty depressing im writing this review simply right now
0	what a horrible song write about the deed you did innocent child were involved the lyric are atrocious i know that because i read them online you can never understand a word this woman say
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i could not even get through song before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc the two song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the price you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you wait a couple of year and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can have mine for dollar lol
0	ok so it ultra new eld age and designed for meditation etc it still doesnt work for me but that may be just personal
0	downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sound absolutely awful it just way too compressed so it extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range almost unlistenable i honestly dont think you can blame a lot of this mp encoding k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have plenty of mp s that sound fine with lesser bit rate
1	this album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with a pop edge to it with a very high level of musicianship dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acoustical folky song amazing songwriting musically and lyrically
0	awful doesnt sound right at idaho all id love my money back if i could figure out how
0	i wa very excited to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i m the biggest playfulness once the cd arrived i assign it on and i wa extremely disappointed very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin

0	i am a vocal man i have admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean during my era of music it pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def leppard pour some sugar on me no college class to figure out what any of those song were about and i guess it is a to have explicit language on every now
0	i could not download this i tried multiple time and reading all of the help information did not help very disappointed
0	didnt like the way it wa sung fortunately it wa free because i certainly would not opt to buy it
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success with that gone guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag in year while staying with andy kindler in his studio
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite from her this time however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but too much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her
0	a of this written material many of the track on this album are misnumbered mislabled
1	thanks for getting it to me on time and a described got ta love doing this dance

1	love it hate it it going to live on a one of the greatest album of all time forever remembered a the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music wa some of u knew it wa called the underground scene i mean let face it if anyone remembers and i dont mean being you know that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away mainstream rock wasnt supposed to be that good not at that time anyways it changed the mainstream for the better i dunno basically hmmm i wonder what theyll like next remember the spin doctor bush yea a far a the underground go ive never read any underground legend say anything bad about nirvana biafra rollins joey ramone iggy heck iggy used to go to nirvana show and go insane if anything ive heard all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspiration to nirvana music yea even jello bottom line is this they put out lp b side lp a acoustic album that blew everyone away a nd time and basically had everyone talking act like korn system of a down tool manson blink where are they gon na be in year more importantly how are they gon na be remembered i have no idea but i know how nirvana is going to be remembered for the next billion this album is the reason why nevermind

1	information technology love it
0	did not point order this item
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can be said for just because im drunk it just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
0	sample track sounded great but when you listen to the entire cd it one monotonous song after another had high hope for this but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune probably will give it away if i can find someone who want it
1	it is eer disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody who ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he release you will never get a part ii to any nin record album because from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old record album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature ghost however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape rather than an record album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission wa indeed successful ghost present beautiful piano enactment soothing swarm of saturated noise and harsh electronic baffle a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to reverie which is how he describes ghost the song are to their core trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past effort making this record album a true whole step forward in the nin legacy
1	norman a voice that is rich a the most satin i have purchased a few of her why because thanks to amazon music i can pick and choose and download the one i want i have now many of her spiritual both solo and with kathleen battle onto both the computer and my mp player to enjoy whenever i choose her singing is grand the selecton is wonderful and the price is right

1	it hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy restriction candidate big star radio city get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior come to mind but the frontrunner from the s ha got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine that both gold mine radiance elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the restriction simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shine in turn whether it the single teardrop with inwards elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems a a group with handsome no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate ampere d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into come out the pool of electronic music but werent sure where to start this one is cant miss

1	a great album i am now ampere a great new fan
0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha honestly been late one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frill from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the year now for the two get hitched with of them to team up with paul mccartney the question is have oppugn they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive second the two of them respond do not ignite in the heart instead they have non shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry slow with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with paul mccartney the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would respond sincerely pas this one up accept because four and five second feel more like wasted time overall song f
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice i wa curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift i think that a song compilation would be enough and trust me it wa enough the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated patsy is also quite and cant carry a tune after youre done burning album also burn anything by alison krauss emmylou harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton listen to real female country artist like shania twain taylor carie underwood dixie chick gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland
1	i wa suprised that this birdcall wa good i wasnt expecting much from an american idol person but this birdcall proved me wrong hopefully the rest of his music is a good a this birdcall

0	poor sound wretched quality
0	not the one i wa looking for
0	oddly amusing song wa curious after hearing the song with her and new hubby chad kroeger lyric for the younger audience good beat
0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal fan thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing in addition the rest of the band member were also hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan thats three strike nirvana fan yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better musical path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fug the fug

0	persuasion i wa downloading the original version very disappointed
0	this is not music it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating seriously it is dumb seriously folk if you want to listen to a porn with no video this is it there isnt any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review just unbelievable youd have to be a moron to enjoy this

1	a great song i love it
1	this song is musically beautiful and the lyric seem to speak to me far too often laupers voice is and this song is so touching
1	great sound a i fathom remember it
0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart studio tape that everyone already ha and isnt that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything is the same volume loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose one should expect for rough mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont i do prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound like a bass people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum it nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox tape is definitely the gem here much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm before the storm it that much fabled last innocence period now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book both have substantial packaging with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it like most of it all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the dvd which again ha been available a a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy the deluxe for and the dvd for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth

0	song were different from what i heard on youtube
1	jonathan sprout performed at my school when i wa six and my mother a cassette tape of on the radio i listened to that tape until it finally broke after year and year of rewinding and replaying so i wa delighted to across digital version of this album on amazon
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a very miserable impression then but i thought id go back and ask another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unequalled soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores unpretentious but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably unrivalled of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy in particular from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt take shape of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty confutable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most birdcall i wouldve expected the birdcall by and large to sound clearly doorsian if not in ray vocal at to the lowest degree in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the birdcall this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of birdcall that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a booze up instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously hear to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review isnt about bash the surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the thick respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best birdcall have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best hypothesis so far is that jim morrison conduce something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i recollect drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt bear anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clearly and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could tucket i have little doubt that if you placed a young thirsty jim morrison in front end of these guy even now that something marvellous would upshot i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing part and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative power a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic power without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest

0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time but still neither is enough to let me sit through song of depression loneliness pining cry in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note but your failed unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river i can not recommend this not even a background dinner music bring back the happy swingin cool seth please

0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two then dont even bother with this album not too before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy for them to abandon that to to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a whole absolutely love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium

0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the cockeyed tracklisting it terrible ok let start it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again snake pit even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a stone classic in every single sense of the holy scripture it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is indefensible that solitary would plosive speech sound me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that dont deserve to be here more than half the third disc is food waste from their worst year of songwriting then some classic that dont really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden muffin are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and the last time really best song than cant you listen me bump moonlight mile let it bleed and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby dont plosive speech sound over album cut like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that span their entire vocation but they should really focus on the golden year rather than equal time allowed for these awful s cut snake pit i mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of harlan fisk stone are bad option flavour i know i have a bias i love these boy brush off whatever family the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time but even a a major major fan i wouldnt recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone i cut my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i enunciate disc one wa a good intro to the band it basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she wa live even though the shine a light version is practically best and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the music obviously i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great satiate but dont get this album it not worth the price find a friend who love the stone if youre smart youll have a few and ask them to make you a mix or get lick used for a couple buck just quell away from this trumpery no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up im going to my room and putting on sticky finger

0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the rd felt release ive only listened to it about time but my first impression were of disappointment one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed im a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining there is a ton of talent in this trio but it just doesnt mesh in this album

1	wonderful cd one of brandis best highlight are the eye and wherever is wheresoever your heart
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami i expected dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s and s their intense musical and political statement and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project i am they will get some from this minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this i give star for bill voice and songwriting talent rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo chicago ooops i wont hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad

1	excellent new music
0	i like to download the free song and album to artist that are different within their genre sister hazel is not one
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely disappointed with this first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they this leaf a good or so empty space on each which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a a the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it one of those album that is meant to be listened to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it nothing spectacular but it a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking wind down after a day a must have any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening

0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really soil dont know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a evident total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye it wa said that during the three plus simple year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more roue apparent because vocalize britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple plan sound like a boy band sung dynasty even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place and there are way too many piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent eld effort packed with pop punk hook can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the rest of their life simply wondering if it wa the three plus year record album layoff between album or the change of sound style doe on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will elementary do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year entire this band wa away the scene changed but their fan base information technology remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to a bargain bin near you right next to all those old lfo information technology album

0	ill start off by saying i like blink and also alkaline trio when i heard skiba joined the band i would get a awesome mesh we didnt i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark very mediocre effort there are two song that are very short and initially funny after further listening are very lazy i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat and are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore let grow a little
1	this is actually a great song i am truly a died hard fan for k michelle so i do not mind keeping it real it is about time she is singing something that is a make up record she ha always accept recorded break up record and album and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new she is crazy sometimes rude and take thing to the extreme but one thing that is true is that she can sing support real music and trust she softheaded will deliver you dont have upwards to like her but you have to like her music sung dynasty and i love it she doesnt have two number one album for no reason
1	i wish more folk knew about ernests music this is not your typical folk artist ernest wa makin folk blue rock music in the s before he launched his composition career in la film score television score emmy later he got back also to his root gave u the opportunity to enjoy where he sung dynasty came from his hobby a he describes it listen to this avocation album it wa released nearly a year before katrina besides the prescient title cut evangaline disturbin blue travelin shoe should solidify your love of this talented composer singer wishing song writer and guitarist par excellance
0	this band eld wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i once again say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and annoying every song it sound take hold of the same i am dumbfounded posture over softheaded this awful sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me comprise of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album first support doesnt is heavy alike pic sung dynasty bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if fustian you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never debate forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an unlike awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of simply at that place hymn dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let take a look at each alike song the lord of steel start off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening learn song to an album rhyme manowarriors wishing again ha musical moment but we heard understandably these lyric before another disappointment astatine i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope born lightlessness in a grave finally some lyric and music that are bettor different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and sung dynasty ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass iodin is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of tone and thats a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand i an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that word fall flat designate humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric arent comprise good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make combat a lot of money this is the type of necessarily song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i from each one dont know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like worldly concern a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal ampere disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it time to die duly noted astatine channel switching guitar riff is so iodin incredibly cheesy but what is ampere worse is that this ampere is another effort where they take their own song angstrom and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus posture sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at destroy a metal helium show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i posse didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre im helium sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio require album anytime a band creates it own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this fustian band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would fraternity remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or eld getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too
0	join ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me leave out for welcome to hell which is the only reason id care it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id ever put this cd in the stereo is to get wind nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted sung and actually at least close to punk but besides that nothing really appeal to me rhythm is an ok sung but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back
0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw run and hide it sound like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing wa take aim out it would have been an o k record album i rated it star because there wa no star all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible i remember the individual that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad if youre wonder this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the i we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cd
1	love it
0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor funny like most men however i find this cd completely pointless and tedious it is not at all funny and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a year old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some folk would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling point trust me they aint

1	i just discovered rosi golan o lucky me she sings song of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare such longing so beautifully expressed innocent she us the minor mode in a way that express this longing and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands love is the solution to everything that it must be real and true love and that such love doe exist all the song are wonderful but i especially recommend come think of me and yesteryear if you to be transported to a place in the heart of real love thank you rosi

0	ive followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum ive bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you youre limitless nothing too hard for you youre limitless there nothing you can not do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it it classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and drone on vocal effective track is dig but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended it a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape
0	i love the album but skip this loud over the top offensively sung song every time it definitely something bad bad for my ear
1	mint condition is an excellent group they sing song that touch your heart and that you let your or others listen the music is wholesome and meaningful
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux quite from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is the best option stay with szeryng or milstein

0	most song on this album are too standardized i only enjoyed song not the best album ive bought in a while i do like sinach and wa quite disappointed with this one
1	here we have some other prize example of dmb doing what they do best live show this show is special for quite a few reason one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer tour this release is the nd dark of a dark run if you were a member of the warehouse you could have perplex both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last release sound issue live in new york this release sound amazing and on a side note i could not genuinely hear any trouble with the new york release but i digress the show start with an volatile you might die trying a great way to start thing off dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song you can tell this is a special dark for the band and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a dainty surprisal for the fan that go straight into yet some other incredible and like every fan know dave and the band always re manufacture the song there is so much energy in this show it genuinely feel like youre there in the crowd after the incredible step dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop if youre a fan just buy because you know it good if youre new still buy it and learn the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy still prove that after year they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if youre lucky enough to collar the caravan this summer im trusted itll be the concert of a lifespan
0	actually to say i dont like it is not totally accurate it is more than just tolerable but i guessing i wa expecting something more than i got
0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be buying any more nor is this a worthy example of trip hop imo this is way overrated i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day yet i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker pimp becoming x etc there are a few record album and then in good order good track but for the most part it a mish mash maybe spend a penny if these support song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length repetitive running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster speak get dull fast ya know getting a few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doesnt make a good record
0	i yawned i actually yawned

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed woman this christmas collection actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song it beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to original santa ive been naughty is a great original track definitely a have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas can be a bad move the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation

1	if you have watched the tv show then you already know how catchy the song are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length i havent actually verified this but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music

1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out it wa really dear but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i commence this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artist i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic edition is clearer and sound more energetic than the archetype which is a noticeably dear thing and i would recommend this track

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my brain from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not dress up and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the speed crust if you like this edition at to the lowest degree also treat yourself to the original
1	when two super talent like keith urban and miranda lambert get together it bound to be a hit and this one certainly is id rate this among the great duet in country music highly recommended

0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a if that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording
1	awesome product i like it
1	heard this on a cable tv play list and had to find it had never heard it before and im glad i did
0	i like bar and band version of song but this ha too much not mirthful in it for me it one thing to be drunk and hear story and laugh about shooting your neighbor cat sleeping with your cousin sister brother dad or whatever else is in this music line about the anus detract from the music for me clean it up be a little more creative and this could be practiced late dark bonfire music

1	i like the rythm
1	one of the best compilation a great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is that of boisterous noisy unruly dope then group like yes pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they also nurture one synphonic appreciation thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece

1	old school excellence
0	first off id like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound it must get boring with recording the same type music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i dont really like this a few song i do like and i do enjoy to but i dont get far in when i have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they consist of poor lyric dodgy and ridiculous spelling way is by far jewel best album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope the next album is back playing instrument writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep clothes on not and it not clever you dont need sell your body to sell record
1	love this cd

0	doe a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not so let drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all john lennon end all of slothful the music center scene it wouldnt have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the army of the righteous music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an turned essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and turned hate striation rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and persecute sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because likewise kurt say thats what it vista is thats how easily duped they are course when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he been anointed by his eld fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern musician and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly could lend her voice persecute for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she simply spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied army of the righteous kurt cobain just wanted to striation incite a revolution for spoiled middle class kid from divorced parent to medicine gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could pore both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and any form of metal especially for younger comprise people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to choose from i think the youve helium given in to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because can sec the medium and vestal stuffy critic say so that there nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b s the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

0	not a relaxing music angstrom a i though it would be
0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from slip canada self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but rock and roll this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere record album rock genre i like la singing and la p demonstrates her talent but everything around that aim is a great disappointment from sung dynasty the opening note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to seldom have been recorded in a large underground turned garage maybe it wa i inwards wa afraid this system album would be a musical catastrophe the raceway instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are at time but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous album since theyll have nothing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or late metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional lee aaron

1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first getaway off it is heavy it feel even record album heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good third or so empty space sung dynasty on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the fountainhead last song louder than word the only with vocal there pickup did seem to be done a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout pickup is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played along on the radio and that is because it one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end really and the next begin through almost the hold out whole album overall it nothing spectacular but it a well put swot together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking channel to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector clarence day i feel i will appreciate it even dense more after additional listening
0	this album just didnt do it for me i got it when came out because i have all their cd and love them to death it too girly and poppy for me high pitched the lyric are not all that clear and dont mesh together to mean one thing most of all the melody the song are hard to listen to you know how some are just difficult for the ear enjoy these song are fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling filled song though control secret and get star from me the rest get about star i cant relate to them much and i get much pleasure from listening to them but i will always love tbms older stuff and their newer hide and seek album

0	it pain in the as me that the constitute last in line is used here i remember seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie depart to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no lupus erythematosus onto the music the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never wage increase above his lack of range and fire he reminds of a better protester on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar adenosine monophosphate sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha taken such an stick album and title a it constitute sake they just dont even start to break new ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke

0	for a while it seemed that joseph deems taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last i swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third base time is seldom the charm sour when she came up with her best to go out album speak now which like brave is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally belong out of fuel her latest album boldly cite red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream babble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and promising of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly ripening backwards her song are now for twelvemonth old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cunning the trouble immediately initiate with her first single we are never ever getting back together the title of the song is already bad enough but i must give joseph deems taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all i of the song on her last princely album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and i of my favorite from her this time however portion ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever think how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of go through or immature age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of just girly talk at i point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an exact parody of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we micturate up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we finish up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can i over estimate the american audience anyways the word of most of the rest of her song are the worst ive heard of joseph deems taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual skirt self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no farsighted capture but annoyingly self centric that can be qualify a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad snatch more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that joseph deems taylor swift had with her past tense strong ballade such a dear john or back to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we bury the fact that swift is very watery vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she peach with gary lightbody of snow patrol lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been argumentation of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that shes quieten country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before ferment with a bunch of song writer for babble gum pop and retort to do everything by herself or work with better musician her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clear not on that level until now a give and take of advice for joseph deems taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being self centric and aggressively victimizing oneself crataegus laevigata have their charm for a while but too much of something is seldom a good affair because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her
1	what a voice dont really have to tell any more
1	my own personal misgiving with album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl cant be seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album of tune about and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies

0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into spiel that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial hold in a if that wa the artist endure word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but delicacy live and studio recording even a competitor for a sight of a process let me put it this way if i audition a process and read the hit i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the immaterial noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i care to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to pretermit out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captivate in a live session is free of all these chance and mental disturbance call it favourable if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic forge is in strength wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise brilliant orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio interpret this is ludicrous since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unspeakably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alerting judged tempo judiciously and i suspicious played to the consultation instead of the microphone moreover he swerve the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the process make sense event played out inside of the process acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled along senselessly a dozen time mvmts and most significantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question stay in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place most all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti karajan eugene ormandy saul steinberg boston et al the live recording move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the endure ounce of conviction is wanting p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording

0	i love the classic moonglows recording so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl oops i downloaded i wa wrong and it wa completely not the original doo wop version of the song this version ha a strong background track it is highly produced it is just off this is just my taste but the new version of the tune wa awful and not what i wa looking for at all anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these

1	ill start off by saying that im one of those completist type i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he done and i have to admit this particular album get the most play youll know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it show it extremely thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that it much slower it not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes album right now theyre quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer
0	music is great it wont download to my phone
1	exellent
0	do not appreciate any nudeness openly on amazon
0	the title simple plan refers to a that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i really dont know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to sound overproduced with a lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodbye wa that during the three plus year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write song making simple plan sound like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem and out of place and there are way too many piano ballad i any trace of the faux label they were slapped with after their two album which were decent effort packed with pop punk hook can permanently be removed now simple plan will spend the their life wondering if it wa the plus year layoff between album or the change of sound style on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the and a half year this band away the scene changed but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what band call unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is headed to bargain bin near you right next all those old lfo album
0	i never purchased it it piggy backed on another order and claim i wanted it besides that it awful whiny voice cheesy boring and silly sound like typical office people trying to get in touch with emotion and make a moving song lol

0	man i hate getting my hope up suitable spend a penny only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing wherefore here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like when jackyl do cover bait version trump but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still specify dont the comprise only track that information technology seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can tot up be sir thomas more said for just because im drunk it just a watered down version of secret of the bottle i dont get why some inwards have already said rally is comprise a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and comprise it sound out of place together this album ha failed to nix rock me roll me second rate or jackly me off in any way sure the production is good but you know comprise what they say about something in particular that you can polish the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same wherefore band they once where they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album bait great hold out nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic
1	leann is one of my favorite artist to begin with no dislike loved everything about this song recommended to anyone who need rapture
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tag down this rare atomic number no idea why the review were so impressive mortal mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure revilement his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar bring ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
0	im certainly no prude and i like noisy music i also find toilet humor rum like most men however i find this cadmium completely pointless and tedious it is not at all rum and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found every raceway of this excrutiatingly long cadmium is essentially the same a guy squall lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a twelvemonth old over unclassifiable unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally i suppose some ethnic music would know that a cadmium with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea but for those like me who think these would be selling point trust me they aint

1	how could you go wrong whatever with live zepp at any price
1	this isnt the princess comprise music youd likely expect it better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i didnt give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen eternal rest to when youre awake but arent a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those song the others are great i loved the price comprise on this medicine and it wa definitely worth alike it
0	i bought this version before i saw that the u s navy band had also recorded the irish national anthem the navy band version in my opinion is much better more upbeat

0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west their song have honestly been jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice only one for kanye wa absolutely awful and not even worth the time and the effort regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney four second is absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the worst song she ha came out with and she need to really find her all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done and his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need much stronger for next work and she wasted her own time with low gimmick song d
1	bought this for secret but am getting hooked on the rest still a timely cd came on time and in a bubble envelope worth a purchase for sure
0	the album is great so dont think the star are for that it get lower star rating because it censored the sad thing is the amazon store kinda doesnt tell you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled explicit but that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to jim gaffigan now is basically a clean and thus i didnt think anything of there not a for being explicit but this album wa done before he became clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people dont get screwed over i know im not the one had this problem and this isnt only album for which this is a issue again great album but buy the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent when they put out christmas album they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made musical accordingly youll notice that buffett never once touch the religious and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious absolutely wrong for what is left his voice but name produce big fear and we have piece of musical garbage a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa and is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found new softening up option prior to high level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad tv and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to witness the best album i dont agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary bicycle and even those dont sizzle like the live performance on crossroad and the production quality is not great either you cant really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great role player but mediocre songwriter probably excuse lack of more widespread popularity and playing at minor venue
1	another song i havent heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want
1	california love the sterling song of all sentence why everybody go to cali it mostly the west coast a for me florida is almost like california i live in orlando which is mostly part of central florida especially all part around the sunshine state
0	it ha came down to rihanna she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year where her voice ha lost it luster and she really hasnt stopped for herself she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song latest song diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too i really did not find the song to deliver a some of her earlier song had i really didnt find it drive into the of the voice i definitely think rihanna need take more time into her song and not rush into making album after album year after year it really ha put a strain on her talent that talk wa awful and unapologetic is the way song d
0	in the late s there wa a yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album but they were not the same league with yes starcastles arrangement were softer le articulate and their lyric were fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know star stuff and friendly maiden in the mist but what wa the point i regret to say this but fly from here sound like starcastle it yes light im glad theyre still out there on new material but this simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other album i posse this is for one of two listener either the yes completist someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a great album imo

1	found this mp download while browsing and remembered just how fabulous the door were love this song and am think really happy with the download
0	unfortunately i to say that hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a low budget movie i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the latinada sound like en tu yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for out loud the only one thats good and the only reason gave star is no me enseaste that reminds of the mundo de cristal but the rest bad really bad the fact that she hired estefano work with her i wa expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again her star paulina but no i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there and i agree with the one who said that she need to wait to speak fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment
1	great gymnasium for gym time
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day im not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the s stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then spent the next year releasing various compilation live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but radio wouldnt have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the s but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let be honest even a lot of the material on their early record werent great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they dont want to which is fine but then it probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album
1	a advertised decent very nice

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good cover a livewire athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in their early day when i wa a teenager who didnt care that dlr a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever possessed ha long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the that many so called rock vocalist of the s were bad nor in the way that many rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a they get older is the type of absolutely singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public

0	frankly i have no idea what the other review is trying to say however i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track note that this is a remix of level and not the translation you probably know from the radio if youre a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this mightiness be what youre looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive

0	not what i wa reckon for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definition and the version the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is good done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature so the star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking also i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantra when they are present and accurately read are music enough
1	another hit
1	nice to be able to download an old single song that trigger old memory instead of buying an entire album
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year saame that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live inclination album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now no more this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice comprise to literary genre hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but alike karl logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of ampere feeling one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it wishing demand an explanation is this his attempt at dissatisfactory dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song comprise about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer comprise album lyric i can sasquatch never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could striation explain bigfoot bigfoot erstwhile caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is accept a record album song about a harley maybe he lost really that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let take a look at each song the lord of steel start off then like a dr sue rhyme but ha softheaded musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors person again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem pain in the neck like warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music sung dynasty clarence day that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal information technology better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he song wa bettor sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky amp the bass is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of tone and thats interest a shame because this is one of the better song on comprise the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound medicine like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been talker very good expendable a pathetic sad begin attempt at trying to get a song iodin on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible iodin medicine loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like a taco helium bell commercial head for military man the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own in earnest song and album title and arrange them in a alexander graham bell paragraph posse the chorus sound like frat boy disintegration attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom represent of steel a boring drop lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more hide of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre im sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates ampere it own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross information technology the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt associate in nursing take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i

0	i am posting review first off to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of year ago delayed a my review may be it is sincere i am a fan of ultimate spinacia oleracea and i consider them one of the skilful band of the bosstown john rock scene i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris record i suppose i should have asked them for a full refund but i somehow choose not to do it

1	there are really only a few thing in lifetime we can count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to outlet a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and strictly flawless on the drum while joseph campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo contempt all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling song performance the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesnt change with the infectious til the oddment every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this triplet and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees squiffy and fluent drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this lot need a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented definitive metal in your lifetime pick this album up
1	flummox amazing
0	this album count only too deep and fat lip a decent song the rest is well all filler and the record is only half an hour long so there are about another five complete song track one a reminder of maiden s of the beast track three is second long it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well piece of advice tape or download the single and spend your money on something else
1	it sound great and the term wa right
0	most likely not the sung dynasty you remember check the preview first
1	love her and her music

1	okay i bought this for one one song jesus savior it s a great song and i love the message behind it my family just sigh when i pull out my kindle and start to play the song information technology on it they class know no matter the season that song will be played haha
0	completely different than any of her older album if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit this isnt the album for you
0	i wa really hoping for that sound they make loved other album of theirs but this one is different it good but i dont care for it it a great buy
0	sound quality is so low you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it it comprise is a nice song though
0	should have been edited version it seemed what i wa purchasing great artist loved blurred line without the ugliness make sure purchaser know what yield there buying i gave it away
0	im confused a to how to listen to this track where do i go my review ha nothing to do about rihanna shes great and i love this call thats why i bought it i wa just disappointed when i went to listen to the call and i had no idea where to go why patois it just download straight to itunes it would have been so much well situated
0	we ordered early and waited with bat breathe but this just wasnt up to her usual it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger le universal audience it also felt like she had forced the new strain they didnt flow and the male vocal did not mix with her voice disappointing
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline i feeling fleeced the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound like he is them he is the only thing that delivered on every album is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting or headphone experience one thing ha that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the album lyric i never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator used to construct the lyric of this album let take a look at each song the lord of steel start off like a dr rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected good anthem like warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are not a bad song but the is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing glory first mention of odin on the album it would been nice to use erics vocal better on one he can sing so him i if he wa sick the day they recorded this album the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of and thats a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song have been very good a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a on a soundtrack to a movie that will a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to the lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice i dont know about el gringo this is a silly that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have and killed for year it time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there better band in the true metal genre im sure their european live show are amazing but demaio need to take a step back the studio album anytime a band creates it own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too

1	this old world of sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle all suffer from attention hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner book and everything else we use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the case it is a blessing that one can conveniently download cd listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york closing say i blessed have been raised in the south with it storyteller but for those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller southern style by robertson
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice ive ever heard she is besides one of the most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather short lived somebody group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at multiplication their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear my two favored song from jonatha are so much mine from story backer in the house and eye in the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favored is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the spill the bean by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her on key art the eye in the sky rail from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am besides a big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at multiplication haunting her song stay and play in your head for a long time and when you count her consistency of work a a whole i just cant imagine why she isnt more popular some of her music ha an almost latin smell to it latin calendar method of birth control and percussion that arrive at you want to dance while some of her song arrive at you want to cry she is that good i dont know what else to say write other than buy her music

1	this isnt the princess music youd star likely expect it better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i didnt give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen angstrom to when youre awake but arent a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i information technology skip those song shine the others are great i loved the price by all odds on this and it wa definitely worth it

0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go artist havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside from smash track are pretty some of the song make reference the previous album which seem like a nice touch but i felt like wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album support egoraptor whose video game review youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise

0	no this is not another ive been a buff of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to revere and i wa really so let down because she a mussitate b slur or c isnt a good a she wa on car wheel true ive eer care lucinda in a creation of boy band and shoal pop music shes been a constant factor not eer brilliant but eer heartfelt and solemn providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock candy her life hasnt eer been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything croak wrong it a double atomic number only track on each record most of them way too tenacious a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mussitate but thats not really the primary problem she ha eer mussitate all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa noneffervescent young and strong it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the finish lack of new tune to be honest i feel ive heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and bitter retentivity are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a second jam session gone horribly wrong there even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock candy ballad some review praise her reasoned which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of stem music it the reasoned of old beer tired muscle and autumn rain it the reasoned of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to perplex done with the job ha lucinda finally lost it have all the day of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she matte up strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i care her former album where she had more than enough song to make it a double i care niggling honey and i care sweet old creation better than car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and in a creation where good and original songwriter are few and former armed force between i noneffervescent hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one however wa just a big yawn to me

0	i am a vocal man so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to simply a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean wherefore during my era of music it wa pretty simple journey lovin touchin along squeezin pretty simple huh def leppard pour some sugar on me no college essential class to figure out what any of those song jolly were about and i guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now
0	im sorry but i did not like this cd i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen very good song but this cd fell way musically these kid are very talented and great musician however i thought the song writing wa bad the lyric bad and the vocal were bad vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own signature and personality into them not just read them off the sheet of paper she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent remember her janis joplin cover turtle blue thats what im about she need to do more of that this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd somebody need to help them with their songwriting it wa all over the place on this cd hoping they can turn it around but for now im backing off for a while to see where they go from here luck you guy

0	frankly i have no idea what the other review is trying to say remark however i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing estimation this track notice that disk jockey this is a remix of level and not the version you probably know from the radio if youre a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this might be what youre looking for anyway just be warned that this remix is pretty mind numbingly repetitive
0	this one isnt good at all used to be a fan of his but he fallen he fallen far it a sad effort to be honest
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say that you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it i would try before you buy first my personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that he that and yet at the time i think he charged off in different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing to listen to it for a dozen time or so when id rather have left alone im aware some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it chance this isnt happening sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the track the nick cover massive arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love written a honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
1	great song great copy sound great i will be downloading a lot more song from amazon very presently loved it

1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this hour long medicine cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even junior ampere cut into in the uneasy social blast climate of respite wa found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal the doleful bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics this cd focus on the hit so if youre looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd comprise for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the s

1	it hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidate boastful star radio city get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior come to mind but the frontrunner from the s ha got to be mezzanine a writing style deflection goldmine that both rarified trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shine in reverse whether it the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock and roll inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group quaternary massive look a a group with no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock and roll fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music but werent sure where to start this one is cant miss
1	great song ive always love that forever song

0	van halen were inside never great nor prolific songwriter comprise mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic showman up front angstrom and one of the inwards best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice populace in their early day when i ampere any wa a teenager who didnt care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever possessed ha long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalist of the s were bad nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a they get older he is the ampere type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than try harder he doesnt even try attract to get the lyric or his phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public

1	maybe this album is not a simply good a rejoyce but it still great i just love her
1	i agree ampere with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often far former armed force from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and minute grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song delight for you
0	i am a vocal military man so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of merriment music why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the snake pit doe this song mean during my era of music it wa pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def leppard pour some sugar on me no college class to physique out what any of those song were about and i judge it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now
0	i couldnt download all or so mp s from the cloud player without clicking them at a time however thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free i wa able to find the site bible is on that site they have the complete bible plus they have both dramatized and non dramatized version of kjv nasb esv and contemporary english if this product didnt need to be downloaded through player i would given it a star that is not because i really like the background music

1	awesome product i like it
0	no this is not another ive been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road accept which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c isnt a good a she wa on car wheel true ampere ive always liked lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop music shes been a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock her life hasnt always been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make inviolable an extra disc out of it sure wish she mumble but thats not really the main problem she ha always mumbled all the spend a penny way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young oscitancy and strong it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the information technology song a few extra whatever time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel ive heard it all betwixt before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song comprise door of heaven i know all about it trusted and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only sung dynasty vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just pallid a age minute jam session gone horribly wrong there even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad some b complex review praise her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music it the sound of old beer sung dynasty tired muscle and autumn rain it the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack press of information technology just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job ha lucinda comprise finally lost it have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of excess it i liked hold out her previous album where she had more than enough song to make mind commonwealth it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than ampere car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and in a world where good and original ampere songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one however ampere wa just a big yawn to me
1	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help hoot record them some of these are truly fantastic my faves since the mat others avail are not so great but they may grow on me but not that one about bird im just happy paul is digging out materialise some gem and recording them in an inspired way if it take romance to make that happen so much the better
0	weak vocal weak instrumental they clearly have lowered the key for yet joseph sound like he is straining he sound like he lying on his back with a collapsed lung where is the donny osmond version that i love other version of this soundtrack star this one is terrible
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd then dont even bother with this album not too long before this cd came out trivium covered metallicas master of puppet in all honesty the song rock but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica this new album is a complete letdown trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is frankly depressing from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort i give this album two thumb down please for the love of insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here revert back to your original sound trivium
1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruise and this song doe it for me it brings back all the memory
1	this is amazing it explains how he refuse to a life isnt holy and acceptable by god this song is one of those who minister to both the saved and unsaved
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane on july age his legion of fan simply refused to let go from point to no le of his rca single release would make the country chart seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot not even the late hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this selection together under the title the essential jim reef please everyone would be on impossible considering the fact he had country hit single between and which crossed over to the hot six to the adult contemporary which didnt begin until and one to the r b chart never mind the hundred of equally wonderful selection from his many eps and lp all in all however id say he did a fairly credible job augmented by five of liner note by colin escott and three more photo of jim one with wife mary at an award ceremony a discography of the content is also but without any chart detail all but track in and included on an early lp were hit for jim of them pop crossover only track made only the country list going to early in his version of the old standard i love you because wa recorded in and wa first on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country hit a a single note too that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in and released on rca victor going to country hot a flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in country remains a bit difficult to the earliest hit represented here and the one that lead off the disc is four wall country for eight week in which wa his initial pop crossover this came after country hit beginning in with mexican joe for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o ranch boy so i to agree with another reviewer who that at least one those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart both s still hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum star
1	sound clear and disappointment in quality i am happy with and love the song go for it

0	it unfortunate that there isnt a negative rating scale the disc took week to arrive both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were unfathomable even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging recycled the day it arrived
0	i this album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang back up you could barely even hear them this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down the drain
0	id rather donate my money to a corrupt charity reason out why cent is the best i can relate to his language in da club and pimp he on the radio and mtv all day which mean he talented he ha talent because he doesnt play any instrument
1	nice standard candle
0	not worth non the purchase
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha spent a bit too time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyric provided by a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative philosophical side to come out high quality amateur project but difficult to listen to
1	sent to a friend and now they love to hear him sing also hope he recovers from his operation thanks
1	im sure that wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest but this one doe the trick for me ive been more than a casual fan he appeared on tonight and sang the piano ha been drinking tom version of jersey the original cant be beat the heart of night nothing really need to be said if you want to try tom wait on for size starting here a bad idea great stuff

1	this is one of the better collection out there some very hard to find song on this wonderful cd set come in a very nice hard plastic box cd holder which is rare these day most multi cd set case are flimsy and fall apart quickly not this one this is a bargain it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd
0	im so disgusted with amazon this season of the christmas are offensive explicit and revolting and it not even a week into december i saw that it wa lady gaga so i wa wary at first but i decided to give the preview a chance light me up and put me on top really amazon really christmas spirit includes carol wintery atmosphere giving etc not sexual innuendo so disappointing esp after the first great song by casting crown
0	this is one of my favs from a boy named goo the cd best known for the goo goo doll breakthrough hit name this mp version of flat top sound horrible it sound like some of the downloads my sister friend used to get from limewire where there wa this hissing that sounded like someone wa running a drum stick along the cymbal ive owned this on cd several time b c i have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad song on abng and im not always in the mood for the downbeat long way down trk but over the course of owning this cd off and on ive listened to it many time this is not the way it supposed to sound i listen to this on my desktop pc via my amazon cloud just like all my other music that i bought in mp format and this is not up to bar with anything that cost money if this were a independent release i could maybe forgive this mishap but warner bros wea is either greedy or stupid this is inexcusable
0	this ha to be the worst holiday song ever made i cant believe anyone would actually pay this i would not even download it for free
1	this is ep loosely based on love in different form my favorite track on it is and then therell be a light also feature crash body self knowledge dependence and corp d amour
0	not a expected thought the music would be calming but it ha so many short piece it wa not enjoyable for me
1	sarah mclachlan ha such a beautiful voice make it sound a if an angel is singing the song rattling one of many tremendous song released by sarah mclachlan
0	i wa eagerly forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent youtube when i first played it i thought something had wrong with my sound system after trying it few more time i realized it wa actually the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through second song more like a concert with someone singing along in the background the piano virtually drowned out her voice this wa also the case in song but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i hope come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people a different company
0	wow another album from where they can not decide what kind of music they want make rocker or slow drawn out and imo dull folk song i really liked war machine aya those i bought and enjoyed ill be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again
1	how can your toe not tap to this one mar pink it out of the stratosphere again
1	heavy song
1	for me all but one strain made for a very good cd their voice are growing in depth and enrichment it different music from their first cd some like my father who loved their first cd because it wa all of the italian dearie and he is italian didnt like this second album at all my husband and i like it very much
0	the orchestral piece have a lot of white noise in the background and many song cut off half way through
0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented in many different aspect he wa creative and every time i listened to his other show i laughed so hard i had to plosive consonant the recording before i choked his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of speech communication made george carlin stand out from others in his field this record album is not creative nor funny it just hateful mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop fireman and snitch are a good a break wind and enema joke go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy because you will not find it here
1	it a very fun song that encourages you to keep your head up and enjoy life youll turn out fine
0	the are great but the quality is so bad that i want my money back it it a static filled compressed mess and it pretty hard to listen to whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album waiting for the remaster
0	ill start off by saying i like blink and also alkaline trio when i heard skiba joined band i figured we get a awesome mesh we didnt i thought tom wa the problem with the but it to be mark very mediocre effort there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy i get that album is named california but how many do we need that forced down throat and you guy are too old to singing about being teenager anymore let grow a little
0	poor quality mixing poor quality sound save your look elsewhere
0	million of american listen to music on their ipod try telling that to this record label which iodin willfully made this cd incompatible with itunes iodin i dont mind buying music digitally but i also like to keep a physical copy of the cd for my collection copy protection doesnt give you this option i am absolutely enraged and i feel like wilfully screaming avoid
0	wanted the song with the actor line this is just instrumental

0	just ok
1	beautiful male you battle cry
1	some good music from the past that let only light current radio play i havent heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly and most of these wont get much play year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get chart quality song not heard much now
0	im a big van halen fan but this hot album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that loaf lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career he no longer seems concerned in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to exercise them his very recent foo fighter appearing singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the goddamn around it been a long time since i heard any hot album recorded mixed this bad i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it it just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding im aware hot is hot but what no mixing board at that venue no cause to clean it up or separate track in the studio im really surprised the band put their revenue stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have been way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a unexampled recording baring no fruit i think this wa just slap together with piddling cause just to get something out there sloppy cause by all involved im still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this one aint gon na cut it sorry
1	enceinte
0	not capable to listen the cd is blank
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and that is because it one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album overall it nothing spectacular but it a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening
1	you either get it or you dont operating theater but if you do get it then you will love it unique spacey cosmic trippy technical and melodic overall it a great thrill solid album recommended to fan of voivod toxik watchtower rush vector atheist cynic or any other technical prog band
0	pretty lame
0	not a good listening song for the holiday voice is too gravelly
0	i just finished downloading from the cloud and there a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window medium player nothing happens the name doesnt even appear in the playlist if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too long window wont even let you rename them in the normal way update ive found a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this pair of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a general sampler if you like but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it finished file repair solution a i suspected the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the computer take to get to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe thats character right there which leaf character for the track name now let consider the name of one of the non functional file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio mp thats character so the total is character well over the character limit window just cant handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short like xyz without the quotation mark thats character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual file go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given above youll cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new file name from the example above which is character youll see that you end up with a total of character well under the character limit of course one wonder why didnt amazon think about this and use a reasonable album name and file name without duplication in the first place my conclusion given that at least four of the track are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least minute screwing around to fix the file naming error imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if it free to begin with of course if youre really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them

0	ok jason moran eclipse is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this matte is away a reason to listen to this bass part work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed argue to top it off the theme included in this album are dull and flat

1	it hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidate big star radio city get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior come to mind but the frontrunner from the s ha got to be mezzanine a genre bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shine in turn whether it the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems a a group with no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson i would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music but werent sure where to start this one is cant miss
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad fifty fifty video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i dont agree that this smashing is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle like the live performance simply on crossroad and the production quality is not great either you cant execution really hear him matching his voice to record album the guitar when he doe that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had only great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart friend piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in wander itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique iodin work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp frequently difference of opinion issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine execution why
0	this album just didnt do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cd and love them to death it too girly and poppy for me high pitched the lyric are not all that clear and dont mesh well together to mean one thing most of all the melody of the song are hard to listen to you know how some song are just difficult for the ear to enjoy these song are fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling filled song though control secret and sleepwalking get star from me the rest get about star i cant relate to them much and i dont get much pleasure from listening to them but i will always love tbms older stuff and their newer hide and seek album

0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax

0	i listened to the sample of this recording and wa struck by how distraught and histrionic g crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love late in lifetime after a long relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his lifetime and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection g voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel care to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over care job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor is she willing to curse deity and die
1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest this is a great song for lover
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep i have yet to find that version for sale this is not a good substitute in my opinion
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one very short a little over a minute buyer should notified have never such a short rendition and be charged like a sample
0	while the package art is nice i think thats about the best part of this disc the best song are at the end of the disc and the saame new vocalist is o k but not a jon anderson most of the song on the cd sound delight the same and feel monotonous ive listened to this about a dozen time thinking it would grow on me but i just dont enjoy comprise it
0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this new cd arrange with great anticipation when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u very cool there is very picayune that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty convolute listener with extremely diver musical taste but i must say this one wa a bust we neer listen to it and had we previewed it would definitely neer have purchased it
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like ive grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time dont even compare in vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who didnt get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own term and in her own word stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she sang from the heart and great experience she took u on a journey of finding her own voice in the figurative and literal sense writing her own song and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing shes ever done career wise i dont know what happened between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic wa a huge fail even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it star but they are nowhere near memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she need to retire from music or get it together
0	sum ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id ampere like it ampere and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing comprise on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually at least close rhythm method of birth control to punk but besides that nothing really appeal to me rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont sung dynasty suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back
0	i am sure he ha other good cd but i havent found it yet
1	here another release from a band that had been dormant for year so here the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while there some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all work organically to achieve some scary result the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience youll ever come across the song are lengthy and repetitious and thats what make them effective while it hard to classify this opus it safe to say that it a doom metal album there a lot of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best album of so far
0	not impressed the tune the beat and the voice not good for me dont have sex what could of been better
0	still a glorious voice but the arrangement suck too lounge y only a when some of these require lush arrangement

1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album also you get to hear his more straight up slice distinctive voice singing rather than fan the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording commonwealth not that there anything wrong with that it just a refreshing change for his fan
0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer not much he it his all when singing with her he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album didnt sound a though he wa it his all sorry
0	she did a song in english so you guy can understand the meaningless thing she ha to say and this song is the most meaningless she ever did but her voice sound much stronger this is not a typical blmchen song there are many backgroungsingers and more lyric there are three song on this single the radio the extended version and the where heart have wing it the english version of her song herzen haben flgel i think it on the blossom album heartbeat
1	beautifully sung by howard shore a great corrupt
0	it a pretty song with great vocal but im not sure about the lyric message once i downloaded and listened to it in it entirety i wa displeased sound rather morbid to me not a great choice for a christmas song sure it ha a christmas y sound but if you really listen it not about anything to do with christmas is it just me or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far i really enjoyed this day of free downloads advent type calendar last year i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest it made for a great collection of christmas song arrangement i wa not familiar with this year is disappointing by comparison

0	god what a letdown this wa people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing month until they saw the tracklisting the original record b side that every already ha the smart tape that everyone already ha and isnt that good and a live cd that everyone already ha then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage meaning a someone else ha already explained compressed to hell so everything the same volume loud and it hurt your ear getting rid of many aural detail in the process no doubt the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing i wa really hoping the devonshire mix to deliver a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer however they are kind of all over the place which i suppose should for mix some drum are too loud lithium some too buried in the mix breed territorial pissing etc i wanted to love them but overall i dont i prefer the vocal on there a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic and the bass sound a bass people who are into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum it nothing i notice though also if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get pissed off google sound city sappy in the end the boombox is definitely the here much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would in retrospect be the calm the storm that much fabled last innocence period now to at what you receive in exchange for your money four cd a dvd and a hardcover book for depending where you got get it with the light out is currently around here and you get three cd a dvd and a softcover book have substantial packaging with the light had way more unreleased stuff it like of it all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand ha been released commercially disc four replicates the which again ha been available a a high quality audio bootleg since time immemorial plus all the live b side are from this show so those song appear three time on the set what anyway you can buy deluxe for and the for or so what do you miss out on not much not much seriously why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth
0	i bought comprise album for some old favorite i remember the playlist list the correct song title but the song that play is different most song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite when play list irish eye are smiling who put the overall macnamaras band etc were not really what played very strange but a waste of money
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song it got so low at time comprise i couldnt really make out the note but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl in truth had several guest playing with him on some song erstwhile all i have to do is dream is alike a duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagle babble out hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well done really enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and in effect the old beatles song if i fell in love with you very listenable and very relaxing
0	im so disgusted with amazon this season of the christmas are offensive explicit and revolting and it not even a week into dec i saw that it wa lady gaga so i wa wary at first but i decided to give the preview a chance twinkle me up and put me on top really amazon really christmas spirit includes carol wintery atmosphere giving etc not sexual innuendo so disappointing clairvoyance after the first great song by casting crown

0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from of my fav band could not even get through song before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with past image i find new or even the slightest interesting about the music on this disc the two song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth the you pay if you feel you must have this i suggest you a couple of year and you can a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact can mine for dollar lol

1	i purchased this album a part of a workshop we presented in my art fraternity gamma xi phi listening to it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black art movement to late the modern era moldiness m sanchez present a work that is smart bold witty and deep this wa my first time hearing her perform a opposed to reading her work in a book auditor a a gay person i must admit i wa taken aback by some of the language in one of the poem but i front had to realize voice communication that this wa recorded during the black art movement a different era and connectedness a different consciousness among the reigning black poet of the time in spite of that language and those idea this is a solid piece of work

1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of the six long track provides intense listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively oye mama about a latin american a you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song im for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you wont go wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i cant praise it enough

0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice scott mckenzies san francisco be sure to wear some flower in your hair is one of the better quality song balin and the town crier train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you go away is quite humorous overall this promise more than it delivers
1	it wa amazing
1	i absolutely love this song they sound awesome together being a woman with a busy job and a married man with the same this song make complete sense to me
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a holocene epoch press release about cheap trick sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist which im guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a platter label name just a list of the song and not in the put that theyre on the cd im not sure how legit this box is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of audio like a higher platter steve earle his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down cool dry station to a serious dirge he obliterates the intended goofy fun the same go for dirty world the wilburys hallmark wa an soft humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss altogether address with care make it a a slower pace ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or galvanic guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i would think he rocked but a whole platter of this one guy is off and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename make it a bogus enterprise id label this for completists only but im a wilburys completist and this is i wishing i could get back
0	a disappointment equate to other beegie adair performance i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it
0	i dont understand this at all there are no redeeming quality to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist i am a avid a fan of bob dylan a there is but he doe not serve himself wellspring with atrocity such a this or that fatuous christmas album i have to go listen to blood on the track and oh mercy now before my judgment implodes
0	i have to this new album a dozen or more time now i have gone back and listened to his first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a closer without question is his best album the solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen more over time than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right for the right hit is without question impeccable with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have ability write some very moving song the best one have been collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming let hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your i wanted this album to be better than any of the album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the material for the next album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song make up illumination i now look forward to next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of to enjoy

0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good minute and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere roll in the hay near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa render roll in the hay going to someplace yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative belief rendered bob dylan vocalise ha been shot for quite a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album corresponding modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia show let go of it in the first place and in the process discover dylan now vulnerable vocalise that sound painfully inadequate the only sung dynasty on this entire cd that work is moldiness be santa which should have been let go of a a limited edition x mama single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn vocalise he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this typeface an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laugh at any longer because he hung on too long corresponding a washed up prize fighter

1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying i wanted pretty hate machine part ii and the such anybody who ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he release you will never get a part ii to any nin album because from the beginning trent reznor set out to do one thing innovate rehashing old album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature ghost however pushing trent reznor to his creative edge the mission to create an instrumental soundscape rather than an album reliant on verse chorus bridge structure the mission wa indeed successful ghost present beautiful piano passage soothing swarm of saturated noise and harsh electronic beat a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydream which is how he describes ghost the song are to their core trent reznor without rehashing recycling or regurgitating his past effort making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy

0	if youre looking for something to help you sleep this is not it the second preview here auditory sensation peaceable and almost hypnotic to me but the full version ha some strange element a the other reviewer said it doe have a lot of static it auditory sensation like popping noise or something to that effect very strange

0	in saame general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which box shaped he or she had only partial control a if that consequence wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it represent this inwards way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a totally unique occasion pedantic an opera performance which i have imagination to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if comprise you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another recording of interference the same force made in the studio and destiny it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force wa recorded by bide davis in the context of a execution complete schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an overall grey over the comprise along sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat stock purchase warrant in register every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant without adding anything other than abode the same music again the performance catamenia is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike inwards during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of the specify associate in nursing microphone moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense event played out inside of the work totally acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their no more point in the unfolding of the drama lay once and for all mvmts melody are not studio apartment trundled along mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question remains in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live recording move up information technology a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the learn classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of tidings otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce difference of opinion of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording
0	frankly i have no idea what other review is trying to say however i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track notice that this is a remix of and not the version you probably know from the radio if youre a dj this could be a great addition to your collection if not well this might be what youre looking anyway just be warned that this remix is mind numbingly repetitive

0	nothing wrong with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it all you need well maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet hit package or live album get boring

0	see jewel cross over from her folk country root to pop laced with heavy beat and keyboard this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the auditor i bang jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing affair boilersuit i think that she will look book binding on this one with regret

0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha frankly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade and lamentably the quality of her voice ha slowly withered forth kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frill from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy gain album of the year now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the oppugn is have they have better in their art swell the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive second the two of them do not ignite in the heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and frankly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would truly pas this one up because four and five second feel more like wasted clock time overall song f

1	ive seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding melody long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a ha been billed all along a a opera for me this may a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history foretell of rock probably neer a by and large great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in their early day when i unsuspicious wa a teenager who didnt prefigure care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band unfortunately whatever vocal talent he ever vaporise possessed ha long since evaporated david doe lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalist of the s were bad nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a iodin they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone worse still he clearly know it and rather than world health organization try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public
1	great song from a great band that will no doubt routine out many more terrific song in the future so far demon is my favorite song from this group
1	great product
1	who wouldnt like jb he excellent what is priceless amazon prime gave a whole of his music free

0	destined to appear on worst ever list for decade pink william shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever dylan wa always a horrid singer but we forgave him because he wa a brilliant poet here he mutilates the exhausted warhorse weve all come to despise you simply cant believe your ear
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind fire this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone young and old get up a move
0	this is one of the worse gospel compilation ive heard this ha nothing to do with gospel it a mix match of learn melody poorly played
1	this comprise wa one of my favorite song from the s i have been putting together a playlist of all my favorite s song and this one had to be included
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent so when they put out christmas album they knew what would work and what wouldnt and made their musical selection consequently youll notice that buffett never once touch the spiritual piece and tull touch spiritual piece only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too in earnest some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice but handsome name produce handsome care and so we have this patch of musical garbage a many have noted the only patch that work at all is moldiness be santa and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have enough money a it is but there could be a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level enquiry but it could be against the geneva convention
1	amazing sound
1	this is a great song that effectively satirizes maudlin garbage like the christmas shoe if your flow up with a steady stream of artificial christmas cheer and need something different this song might be good for you

1	i remember when the four top were popular and i still love them today soon inclination my oldie favorite list will be at
0	there are a lot of four or five star review aver that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their soda water album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly swop the sound of the instrument they dropped the unquestionable folk real sounding instrument keep in mind i hate hipster and went with what can only be delineate a a fake sounding electronic drum limit a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any alone pedal vocalize or anything it vocalize like untalented drivel deplorably coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice still sound alone and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if this wa their first class honour degree album would they ever have make up it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing decision to entirely change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from joshua tree to achtung featherbed but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree to soda water they should have learned from u
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish jam tank music in the past ha been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd the great thing is he didnt try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound he just stayed true to himself in i can appreciate for the lady tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u lol
0	i really take sad when i hear this young rap crap on top of the greatest band ever i used to go see these guy when nobody even knew who they were maybe show of or people that wa the good ol day god do i miss the house man
1	got this song in my point after watching true detective on tv so i had to buy it
1	i love the arrangement on this collection many my favorite easter song with stirring instrumentation a good collection to have
0	sum ha no comprise talent they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible if you want something close to decent in the pop punk tangible genre try new found glory the ataris or maybe older blink material this album is made for stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music closely out there dont degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no at that place talent band pick up some afi or bad religion to truly comprise understand the real meaning of being punk
0	this is not the theme from enterprise this is the same song where my heart will take me that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series
1	here another release from a band that had been dormant for here year so here the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never a fan comprise of the experimental side of celtic frost and while there some experimentation in here to a greater simply degree accept it all work organically introduction to achieve some scary result the album is ampere also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience youll ever come across the song are lengthy and repetitious and thats what make them effective while it hard to classify this opus it safe to say that it a doom metal album there a lot of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to abide by frost for such a masterpiece yield one of the best album of so far
1	uplifting song
1	love it hate it it going to live on a one the greatest album of all time forever remembered a the band that made the majority of people remember what rock music wa some of u knew it wa called the underground scene mean let face it if remembers and i dont mean being you that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away mainstream rock wasnt supposed to be that good not at that time anyways it changed the mainstream for the better i dunno basically hmmm i wonder what like next remember the spin doctor bush far a the underground go ive never read any underground legend say anything bad about nirvana biafra rollins joey ramone iggy heck iggy used to go to nirvana show and go insane if ive heard all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspiration to nirvana music yea even jello bottom line is this they put out lp b side a acoustic album that blew everyone away a time and basically had everyone talking act like korn system of a down tool blink where are they gon na be in year more importantly how are they gon na be remembered i have no idea i know how nirvana is going to be remembered for the next billion this album is the reason why nevermind

0	sound timbre is so low you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it it is a nice song though
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it a shame what pass for hip hop these day people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all because lil wayne is whack im not a hater i dont gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pas off a hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music
0	you couldnt tell this wa a live tape and i wanted a studio version
1	my husband loved it
0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl or then cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la s flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes
0	uggg another cd from leann rime you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice it is sad to watch all her project fail and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas people put christmas music when their career are failing leann used to have a great voice and a likable talent not anymore i can not understand the word she is singing and the album is not very good i used to be a big fan but she seems so unaware of what she ha done to her career lately too bad over

0	owned the original music from spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use string for the main line this brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and distinct accent this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else pale the i spy album are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is would be to me like the fishing hole song andy griffith done with a instead of hagen whistling
1	im sure hold back that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest but this one doe the trick for me ive been more than a casual fan since overeat he appeared on fernwood tonight record album and sang the piano ha been drinking tom version metre of jersey girl the original cant be beat the heart of saturday night nothing really need to be said if you want to try tom wait on for size starting here isnt a bad idea great stuff
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch id seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and hed written the song for him it wa kind and touching and the song itself wa great look for another year at massey hall i am

0	take some no doze before you listen to this one
1	my own air personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and record album girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love consolation in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the circumstance heebie jeebies
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes i realized that it wasnt him a all from the very beginning of it i did pine tree state not like the song just from the clip i heard if you ask me this group operating theater or singer sin synthetic are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame i almost bought render the cd here simply from amazon im so glad that i didnt

0	after angstrom listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd ive always liked dj shadow and wa disapproval interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now in it is typical shadow ambiance and inwards found sound but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like a few track attempt a dubstep feel but it come across a accept plodding a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern those actually sound the coolest the part that make me absolutely dislike the album even though part are ok is the rapper in the rap track that state that trump ha sex with his youngest daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your information technology politics to yourself unless you wan na lose half of your audience angstrom moby just alike did the same im selling all his cd now a he mouthed off too about trump
0	this album didnt do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cd and love them to death it too girly and poppy for me high pitched the lyric are not all that clear and dont mesh well together to mean one thing most of all the melody of the song are hard to listen to you know how some are just difficult for the ear to enjoy these song are fine most of the time but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to listen to there are a few really enjoyable feeling filled song though control secret and sleepwalking get star from the rest get about star i cant relate them much and i dont get much pleasure from listening to but i will always love tbms stuff and their newer hide and seek album

1	the s
0	i wa big disappointed by this album bluntly speaking it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single then stop searching for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old ii soul i heard killing time on a community channel on cable it wa broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by and the bean is just a huge let down disappointed with the current direction
0	this album wouldve been so much with live instrumentation i hope his next one will be great like he is on the road with his band
0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this new cd set with great anticipation when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u very cool there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste but i must say this one wa a bust we never listen to it and had we previewed it would definitely never have purchased it
0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said the only place that ha the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of s cd it sound a little thin to me but it the right version at least

0	a few day ago i purchase the sister album fete and loved every single birdsong based on that i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it after hearing these song i definitely will not be purchasing this album the girl are definitely beautiful all right it easy to see why theyre so well loved because of it but on this album their voice havent suppurate enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their former work where they dont sing with little girl voice and their birdsong selection is a little more mature
1	awing

0	this is my favorite cd however the vinyl arrived scratched and i have to be able to actually play it without it skipping through most the song i wa extremely disappointed
1	medicine i would ask people to purchase beyonce if they like this artist music is an individual choice and should be treated a such
1	this second single from the new album rise releasing june is more of a power ballad john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song but it is still a good song with a great message of letting love cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet think along the line of lucy although american noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the band just think of a regular power ballad from a good s rock band
1	a very strong set of song both lyrically and melodically and robin in good voice throughout
1	catchy tune written by an quondam pro with many good song under his belt i think it reflects on a career in a very messed up industry
0	katy perry second hit song is very catchy but it annoying it one of those song you cant help but hum certain part to and the video is just well it just there i sung dynasty thought the lady dancing with the umbrella or whatever wa kinda cool the first time i saw it but idea i wa wrong this song is just the flavor of the week and when i first heard it i attention getting didnt like it it gotten a bit kind of better since then but dont expect this to win any grammies lol star

0	i dont know if it amazon fault but it seems inwards like the sound mixing on the mp is bad too then much treble muddy in the midrange and the bass is lacking or eclipse maybe it just overshadowed by the treble listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ear literally not figuratively hurt im so thankful for program like audacity sound manipulation program so i can balance it out myself but i shouldnt have to
1	leann rime is one of my favorite artist to begin with no dislike loved everything about this song recommended to anyone who need rapture

0	i had pre oredered this album on itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell in sexual love with bright eye when i heard their album im wide awake it morning the gentle yet strong instrumentate and focus on vocal had a large calming effect on me which is why i grew to sexual love bright eye however this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered most of the song rely heavily on electric instrumentate and a distorted profound that come off a tempestuous rather of thought provoking i would not recommend this to anyone
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success with that gone my guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag in year while staying with andy kindler in his studio

0	let me say outset im a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is great a usual but the lyric will lose you there are deuce song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the rest of the lyric are just hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all erg ay caramba unrivalled note obeche la la la la bamba or jolly springtime oh the jolly springtime in the lively month of may oh the heavenly time of day oh the come again day or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl shes about to babble today today today the opening song today today today is a awfully conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneousness a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i dont know but i had to listen to this cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about
0	aint nothing like crackheads in love netherworld brings back memory doesnt it remember when they both hooked up cocaine wa indeed a hell of a drug
1	i can listen to this over and over again
0	cant stand the voice or the inst rumentals support in the back i mean whats the refund policy gad
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe this song is not only attention getting but powerful and sang really well i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over excited for the full album
1	this song is word beautiful beyond word
0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal dont sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song are great but the remastering wa entirely pointless
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era release because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a song thats been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent
0	yikes i mean yikes what the are they banter is this some kind of weird joke i couldnt wait to place my guild for this long awaited live vh album and i couldnt have been more excited the clarence shepard day jr it arrived i carefully unwrapped it and studied the cool packaging no band pic though very odd and let it rip oh my god what were they thinking this is so freaking bad i suppose it just turned me off music period the drum are sloppy the guitar are surprisingly sloppy too the key are lagging behind the band the bass is solid though but please please please dont even take about the vocal this is not the band i know and love regretfully i absolutely hate this loss

0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the le problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick roughly a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled crick and most significantly they went with volition a different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is record album that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of close to the best guitarist songwriter in the business wa now out the door to dis be replaced by perhaps someone with too le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired credit rating notion so what doe the first non rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track id ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the importantly band we get simply a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not totally to mention a couple of center song about whole what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album renown wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after le this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh comprise talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some as again this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ra songwriting but sometimes it what a producer rest wont let the artist do thats just a important ya know

0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a iodin cruel heartless individual not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying she actually sound like shes trying id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day i think simply this music wa meant for prisoner of chafe war that are meant to go through psychological torture please do yourself a favor do not associate in nursing listen to this album or anything else by clarence day this artist i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do i am forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is very pressure generous a i dont even think it is worthy of review i only do this to warn my fellow music lover

0	wtf is this trash this album draw the weekend killin you
0	this album is horrible the rest of new wave halen are doing a terrific job but david lee philip roth should be put out to pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a crappy execution problem david lee philip roth think he david lee philip roth circa a such he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly he only sings half of the lyric the rest are spoken he tot all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric he change up the pacing of the lyric by coming in latterly and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a raft of stupid stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward he us completely different lyric when a song break down quiet think live for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them execute panama on prise kimmel right before this album wa released youll know what im talking about that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the following poetry sick sing it for you right this time in other word dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and sick wait which are the main reason i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee philip roth in his prime do not bribe this album unless you love disappointment
0	because the song cut where the explicit word would go i wish i could get a refund i ended up buying sung dynasty the explicit version instead
1	this product simply a recorded countdown for each interval of exercise second of rest for a total cycle
0	first off id like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and with a new it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit folky song on the other hand i dont really like this album a few song i do like i do enjoy listening to but i dont get far in when i have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they consist of poor lyric music and ridiculous spelling this way is by far jewel best album i thought it signified new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument writing thoughtful music and singing heart out this album would a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever dont need to sell your body to sell record
1	we lost this wonderful country singer way too young his song calm the soul and lift your spirit he will be missed

1	it hard to out the best pop album that most people have never heard there are so many worthy candidate big star radio city get mentioned a lot t rex electric warrior to mind but the frontrunner from the s ha got to be mezzanine bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison each track shine in turn whether it the single teardrop with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal or the heavy rock inflected angel and dissolved girl or the epic show stopper group four massive seems a a group with no limitation and even rap hater can appreciate d low key almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music but werent sure to start this one is cant miss
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tune over and over again all over you go this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling and an upbeat tune i enjoy listening to this over and over again i would love to discover more of these kind of new tune new to me anyway
0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival and loved every single song based on that i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it after hearing these song i definitely will not be purchasing this album the girl are definitely beautiful all right it easy to see why theyre so well loved because of it but on this album their voice havent matured enough to enjoy listening to no matter how pretty they are skip this album and move onto their later work where they dont sing with little girl voice and their song selection is a little more mature
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than astatine many of the reviewer here seem to rescue think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album isnt for you but zcs is strong repulsion from beggining to end with unspeakable catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices s album the others being flush the fashion and special force all three while they dont match most of piece his s album deliver the hard rock good brain while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one weak moment for me barrel maker is the painful theme from the class of i am the future standoff which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
0	i turn over this a listen a friend of mine know im a with child fan of frank etc so he thought id like this but like so many young guy out there trying to sing like frank sinatra im take care at you mike buble they fail because they have no heart now technically seth is a good singer i dont particularly care for his singing voice but obviously he got some natural endowment there i almost appreciate the era style of the album cover id like it more if they werent trying so hard to call forth the image of frank old lp cover but seth singing ha absolutely no heart no soul whatsoever and this is whats missing in the singing of now anyone who think they can pull off singing doe and were left with a glut of talented singer very few of whom i ever care to take heed this is one of them i just cant take it it empty singing no heart not to mention it frickin brian griffin singing impossible to listen to
0	ive followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar artist p lyric always seem elementary like very come up plane they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey literal entail but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin mug up ive bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and shine drum fill are drop theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar dot in and boring on the floor drum pattern it audio more like what youd hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the claim track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there are no limit with you youre limitless nothing too hard for you youre limitless there nothing you can not do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i have a go at it youre limitless youre limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the chorus or time

0	i turn quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics exercise ive try on to rule other recording by okko that mightiness be similar in style so far ive had only moderate success hybrid fart that name should have been my first clue if were yet talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few to a lesser extent hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalizer could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german im not so sure it yet an okko bekker recording i couldnt rule his name anyplace on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i didnt look too long before i convinced my ego that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then test a fast a you can in the opposite direction the medicine struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can rule a commodity successor to sitar electronics let me paint a picture anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band all record are a splendid journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review

0	train ive been a dylan fan from slice way back and im also a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what ha happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such emote praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these song and im tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some associate in nursing of sinatra best im a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not vocalization talk recommended for dylan deficient fan and certainly not recommended for sinatra fan

1	great product great seller
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best ive ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the whole of disc even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc arent bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fan overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette
1	it a very happy song that you help but put on a great big smile to while you listen

1	ill start off by saying that im one of those completist type i have to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he make out and i have to admit this particular album perplex the most play youll know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it prove it extremely thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that it much slower it not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue case stuff with dwyers indiscernible interpreter wailing over every note do yourself a serious favor and picking up both yikes record album right now theyre quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer

0	i like other song by her better this song is okay but she ha done a lot better on her other song
0	what i simply and always say is that when a artist ha to come out with a song they dont really deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to do that attempt with going to a modern r atomic number phonation and sound in her euphony it really hasnt really drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song i really get hold it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would tantrum into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would do i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d

1	here another release from a band that had been dormant for year so here the verdict monotheist is just pure greatness i wa never a sport fan of the experimental side of celtic frost and while there some experimentation in here to a greater degree it all study organically to achieve some scary resolution the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tarradiddle debut which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience youll ever descend across the song are lengthy and repetitious and thats what make them effective while it hard to separate this opus it safe to say that it a doom metal album there a lot of stuff survive on it never get boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great counter album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best album of so far

be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to with sing sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront distorted voice effect not the album strongest but and innovative at the very least love once again your typical second song it hold a sense of though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the of moon safari especially the later of the piece it at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a definitely not song youd think air would produce with it western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it fun but also lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regard to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level of musical to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song like two into the first half is up beat and a similar essence to be a bee it progress slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the half of moon safari with this new star in sky pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and laid back in it approach this tune is a near perfect night song with distorted harmonica interlude it bound to whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track the album with it hand picked guitar segment and it front line horn melody it a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but im not ruing out a higher score it definitely an album need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their album but for anyone who been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id say hz on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making attracting whole new market denomination of listener from all corner of the globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me

1	i dontknow why but i love this vocal
0	i became rather a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics workplace ive tried to get other recording by okko that might be similar in style so far ive had only moderate success hybrid farting that name should have been my first clue if were evening talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard concordant not really the language of love is it or mayhap not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german im not so sure it evening an okko bekker recording i couldnt get his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i didnt look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front natural covering of the cd do not translate a hybrid farting i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the diametrical direction the euphony struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too garish sort of like the closing of day rough mix until you or i can get a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review
1	just about everything this valet writes is better than the last

0	okay this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or at but even though it a comeback in comparison to those two failed album this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road honky chateau rock of the westies etc many of the song on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej song just like belgium chloe the title track but sadly the song fall a bit short my advice skip this one and purchase jump up which isnt a great album but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his s form
0	i never ordered iodin this

0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and album i dont know how to account for it may be that in today market most can preview an album before buy it so they arent likely to end up with something they dont like unlike in time past received this a a gift this ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late s they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band ha a lot going for and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in i found it trying to get through whole thing for a listen i have listened to twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new few listens to see if it will on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head ill come back to update this review if it grows on me
0	poor sound track these is a very loud grind away in the background that distracts from the very good violin music if the mixing wa better this would have been a fantastic track unfortunately i did not take heed the grind away in the very short sample you take heed when buying on amazon
0	i wa really excited to get this cd a i already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it it arrived soon enough however when i listened to it hardly any of the song listed on the back are actually on the cd this is really disappointing i dont know if it is a manufacturing error but it really a shame that they didnt check it the song arent a good a the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to have one track list on the cd and another on the cd cover now i will have to look for it next time i go to mexico and wont be ordering it again

1	our first dance a husband and married woman wa to this song i hope we are dancing to it for year to come
0	not good at all
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to pas on the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and fairly relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is gimcrack decent that the tranquility is shattered once you bed this is present in this recording it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax
0	this cd is absolute garbage sellout britny fizgig green day clone pop for public consumption avoid everything from descendent and all in the s and later

1	the grandkids love it give thanks
1	i havent heard anything of his since the crossover that i didnt like i can listen to alike him all day
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low it not even bit sound ilk it wa recorded on audio tape
1	i do it this album favorite include anthem run outlaw scared chasing twister and my whole life long after it all make me weep with delight if youve never seen them live dont miss the chance anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand take few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live
1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old school type soul voice ive heard this year these are all original song too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourite though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hope too high breathe love maybe im not the man evil woman which im sure us the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country though this is not acknowledged they dont know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group isnt being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can
0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range he sounded rather screechy the title track wa also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song not a sad one i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing
1	some good music from the past that get only light current radio play i havent heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly and most of these wont get much play year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get chart quality song not heard much today
1	just like the movie

0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from virago it is just the same minute of music cycled a dozen time and the music is too intense for a sleep aid
0	came in distorted couldnt even hear learn it
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cd didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad
1	love roll in the hay slipknot new album im a huge fan aka maggot highly recommend to all the maggot out there

0	comprise thought the song would pick up but it doesnt we were looking for something a little more dramatic but it kind of bland
0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan nirvana word while rebellious offered nothing new or even creative to the musical operating theater record album landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there but cobain didnt speak to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his operating theater loyal fan thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or stood for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted poorly constructed and almost completely lacked companionship any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract operating theater or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i also seriously shouldnt need to call any attention to load the complete lack of adeptness non or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing accept ampere in addition the rest of the band member were also hardly totally virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability averting to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is also roll in the hay completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ time ha power repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are power about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan thats three strike nirvana fan yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will roll in the hay regarding a better musical path which it isnt too late to espouse pursue for the love of god if one exists heed my call the world will experience a profound record album change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or playing or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise society and all that the archetypal american stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fug the fug elliott

0	im a big fan of terry hall and the colourfields fantastic first album virgin philistine but with personnel change and a different vibe this album pale in comparison terry voice is still great but he go in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion which is still one of my favorite from the mid s
0	while at cent the collection is quite cheap and feature some fine performance buyer should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly it is drastically and clumsily cut we get the soprano recitative there were shepherd abiding in the field but not the marvelous aria that follows and his yoke is easy his burden is light along with he shall feed his flock is also missing id have gladly given up a few of the other amazing track in order to get a messiah that wasnt edited in such a clumsy fashion this seems like a performance worth getting to know but those who purchase this collection will be missing quite a bit a helpful commentator on this review pointed out the the entire bach collegium japan messiah is available in nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href amazing classical handel dp b g kbsb ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf amazing classical handel a
0	um no
1	really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal where is should be primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with while the lyric bring other groupie to mind such a whats your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing mind other real road classic such a turn page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a time to really it
1	i think it a different side of beyonce i feel shes confessing her love for jay z and how they compliment each other by saying that shes drunk in love great record and very sexy video

1	this song give me so much inspiration whenever i need yolanda adam is one of the most talented blessed gospel artist today
1	great ive always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i wa to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film pax it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released the year the music itself is no different from beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the it just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you wont be disappointed
1	here is a frank frank sinatra single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago ol blue eye recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his blossom at capitol record released in january of the tune spent week on the chart and ailing at the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it before this is the original hit immortalise
1	i just discovered rosi golan o lucky me she sings song of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare such longing so beautifully expressed innocent she us the small mode in a way that express this longing and this innocence perfectly with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that screw is the solution to everything that it must be real and true screw and that such screw doe be all the song are howling but i especially recommend come around imagine of me and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart of real screw thank you rosi
1	im just starting to get interested in classical music this a great bargain i dont like all of the strain but there is a wide variety some very familiar if you want a great overall extract at a great price this is a must have

0	there seems to be a concerted crusade by a number of fan to boost the rate of this candela by mail glowing review so it going to be more or le more challenging to trace what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would present to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use confiscate all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this candela are not a ego confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to pick up new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the chance to listen to it first before buying it the conflate review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan not least because the greater teemingness of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a unplayful fan of the early work groban did with jacques louis david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly previse this album based on what groban had said about modify direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his resilient version of modify colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often nevertheless i dont feel that he practise that and yet at the same time i think he charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album eventide after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen clock or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i precious to present it a chance but this isnt bechance sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a strengthener of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral agreement an italian song massive orchestral agreement london hymn im expecting to pick up it booming out of city of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at clock to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher mention regarding the response of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess eventide holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great honour for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an creative person and experiment musically eventide if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the candela like another referee i cant cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic ocean sadly it staying in the package to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan mail positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board entitle be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the candela could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new creative person to them should pick up a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very intelligibly not aimed at merely promote the rating of this album many of them explicate very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a data link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan bobsled or exploit his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from vocalist the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and criminal record several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and retreat interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project alike my best guess is that he had some missed assurance he could finish the trump title cut which is switch probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may word have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the criminal record serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none consociate of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the comprise better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent comprise who can choose her future session work on bob dylan the basis of these recording derisory jim james of my morning jacket ace all his along assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very understated singer compared to the ampere others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known word basement tape in a truly categorize deluxe set instead sung dynasty which hopefully consociate will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

0	ive followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album ive never been a big fan of their songwriting when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta hillsong brian johnson david crowder jeremy riddle and similar there artist p lyric always seem elementary like very surface level they just make come out word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig smashing deep for word alike that convey real meaning but what they lacked in songwriting they always more than compensated for in musicianship their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum ive bought the album only for their edgy rock sound with this new album the blazing guitar and at that place smooth drum fill are missing theyve gone to more of an electronic sound with a alike little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring on the floor drum pattern it sound more like what sound out youd permeate hear in a disco very disappointing i wont buy ampere more p album if this is the direction they continue to take for an example of the shallow lyric here is the verse chorus to the title track limitless im saying goodbye to any limitation im saying hello to the god of all creation there are no limit with you there good day are no limit with you youre limitless nothing too hard for you youre limitless there nothing you can not do you are bigger and youre greater and youre stronger i know youre limitless youre doh limitless and thats it sing the verse twice and the championship chorus or time

0	answer i gave this a listen a friend of mine know im a big fan of frank etc simply so he thought id like unexpended this but like so many young guy out there trying to sing like sinatra im looking at you mike buble they fail because they have no heart now technically seth is a good singer i dont particularly care for his singing voice but obviously he got some talent there come out i almost appreciate the era style of in effect the album cover id like it more if they werent trying so hard to invoke the image of frank old lp cover center but seth singing ha absolutely no heart no soul whatsoever and this is whats missing in the singing of today anyone who think they can pull off singing ampere doe and were left with a glut of talented singer very few of whom i ever care to hear this is one wienerwurst of them i just cant take it it empty singing no heart not to mention it frickin brian griffin singing impossible to listen to

0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired comprise here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his videodisk guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and comprise i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash striation he lack the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it fathom inwards back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe
1	if you have watched the tv show then you already know how catchy the song are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length telecasting control i havent actually verified this telecasting but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music

0	not at all what i expected kind of astatine insipid
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens voice started chiming in i dont recall that from the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but i cant recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd i should have demoed the song before ordering but i do like the disco song that are not available for download
1	a sooner state
0	this cd contains the grinning censored version when cash say the son of bitch youll hear beeeeep instead what are we year old the at san quentin original version is uncensored im not sure what other version are uncensored but definitely trusted this one is when this song is not censored it is a star song that put a smile on your face
0	it unfortunate that there isnt abyssal a negative rating scale the disc took five week exfoliation to arrive both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging recycled the day it arrived

1	i have hundred of xmas am a dylan fan read all the review here wanted to add i love this cd i agree with all the detail in the star review wont repeat them but what stand out is the sincerity classic feel of the arrangement here it is warm glowing like a warm fireplace dylan raspy voice add the spice crackling of the log for me this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra manilow or bing unlike other big name star who make the obvious xmas collection dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over over definitely a keeper from left field to center stage
0	lame anyone who bargain this is clearly an idiot nigg over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat rap suck

1	r kelly by far ha left the r b wanta be in the dark r kelly ha produced hit for some of the biggest name in the musinc industry to come out with a album that totally switch up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing this album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really want to hear music again go get it
0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all appeared either in vinyl or cd cassette form a in a box is good b side track with a techno dub feel a la s flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is best version of all the remixes

1	great uplifting soul album roll in the hay from this baltimore based quartet this is a real band using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old school type soul voice ive non heard this year these are all original song too the music is very gospel influenced though far rattling from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourite though including the fantastic opener never leave you lonely hope too high breathe love maybe im not the man evil woman which im sure us the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country roll in the hay though this is not acknowledged they dont know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer it aint over this is catch one breath how music is supposed to accept be made and why this group isnt being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i likely would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black psyche music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made back in the day you will probably love this get simulate a copy while you can
0	when it ha came down to beyonce knowles and today diva she ha became the most overexposed product in music today sadly the quality of her voice ha died and so ha she in song but nevertheless when she wa a part of destiny child she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay z they have had other collaboration for her career like the wasted deja vu and the recent drunk in love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart and bonnie clyde it isnt a good song because it ha been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband still there need to be better in voice and being crazy in love song d

0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good nonetheless his voice sound rickety due to age i guess and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third birdcall both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his blighter singer crosby and nash he lack the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while perchance

0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are saying the value are terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer a garage no sound buffering lining in fact im pretty sure they recorded on a year old webcam and mic set up using sound mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version secondly the message is stupid they dont really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band this album wa a waste of time this is why they needed to put a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover there no way the music wa going to sell this album

0	where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyric go while the music may have at least attempted to go back to from here to infirmary it stopped dead by skibas voice and lyric such a on draculina and the american scream his raw passionate word have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocal and now song just seem awkward when he decides to throw the f word into them eating me alive dan manages to save some of the album with off the map and fine but once again they lyric are sub par dont get me wrong i dont hate the trio theyre my favorite band but they could do so much better than this i wanted to like it and went into it with an open mind but after a few listens nothing stuck out and i didnt even feel the need to listen to it ever again if you really want a good alkaline trio record go pick up nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href good mourning dp b yjda ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf good mourning a nbsp and anything before it if youve listened to this one and like it go try out nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href from here to infirmary dp b b xu ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf from here to infirmary a nbsp or nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href goddamnit dp b gm y ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf goddamnit a nbsp i promise theyre so much better

0	i know most of the review here from people that know danny or listen to him an am talk show and a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once gotten to chorus of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting here just studio music out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it too bad actually if he had stronger voice could at least be a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george or hank williams to get the real deal

0	adam voice is deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the best he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the lyric are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt make him a mainstream pop star he wa never that his wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation classic on american idol mad track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury even though he couldnt match stage presence or personality i his first two cd didnt enough to satisfy his label and stockholder so this is a ditch effort to to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan you can rock and you can wrench emotion out a good ballad

0	did not order this
1	i do pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what can infer from listening to her music and havent yet heard all of her s release because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan of rock and vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful verse take some wonderfully unexpected in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds of phoebe snow maybe because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that keep jumping out at me even year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to abrupt just excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part noticeably distorted have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song thats a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an melodically magical passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today will seem like it the backdrop for of the most moving experience of your a song thats been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just great song easily one of my all time faves it unfortunate the engineer distorted the hell out the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your woman it not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in good way sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting a garden pagoda in cloudburst there also an understated acoustic solo in the bridge kage no naka no shadow the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i sat down to translate tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than faster tempo of the of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either or pop although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around getting her other s disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor metaphysical angst and if enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent

1	it prince ampere plain and simply a legend rip
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine learn dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is tug a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is terrible a number of the song on this album have an over tug driven distortion sound effect when you hear the song live the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance but on the album version the distortion effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the comprise music i ran the album through a live music audio comprise enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it helped quite a bit normally when looking at the vocalize oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your information technology stereo because they have been processed and helped not fixed the end sound recording result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is
0	this version of the song doesnt sound quite right to me make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it the one you want
1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented a breath of fresh air
0	ruined a perfectly near song

1	the unique voice of bonnie tyler combined sung dynasty with the emotional presentation of the song lyric combine to make this a timeless and classic favorite
0	horrible i only bought it because the ex wanted it i wish there wa a no star rating
0	advertised a the non explicit non edited version and it not it the radio version waste of i need more word
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his second album wa the trump he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song the material is weak and the word are laughable this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to take emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american language idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he tour with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or personality i guess his showtime two cd didnt sell decent to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need another shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have bewildered the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad
1	barb still ha it
0	a big disappointment purchased based on the high praise it received inwards in a recent aarp magazine publication
1	i fell in love with ann wilson the first time i heard dreamboat annie year later ann wilson sound even better wether you are a heart fan or have never heard the group before this is a must have album if you love hard driving rock and roll
0	im so disgusted pine tree state with amazon this season of the christmas are casual offensive explicit and revolting and it not even a week into december i saw that it wa lady gaga so i wa in truth wary at first but i decided to give the preview a chance light me up and put me on top really amazon really christmas spirit includes carol wintery atmosphere giving etc not sexual innuendo so disappointing esp after the first great song by casting crown
0	most of the music start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a jazzy type sound which doesnt do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep of course the sample that are given dont let you know that worst i have spent may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window amazon can do that with it own money i wont purchase another music from them
0	sound quality very low but a great classic song
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe this song is only catchy but powerful and sang really well i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over excited for the full album
1	amazing
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had plenty of that song thats what this song totally ride on at least chris brown even though it a similar beat ha something passing for his song with you better lyric nice video altogether i just dont appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it plenty in second i will never forget you youre in everything i do later just comparable a tattoo ill invariably have you blah blah blah blah jordin start compose your own song and perchance youll get some attention star end note beautiful voice but get a unexampled producer who isnt afraid to try something unexampled and different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems comparable everyone ha nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g but copying a song beat that ha antecedently been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are shopworn and super primary and nothing i mean nothing besides the outspoken work stand out
1	great song ive always liked brag so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film special k pax it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year the music itself is no unlike from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you habit be discomfited
1	possibly the effective soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie this soundtrack is a utter example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie nothing fancy just dewy eyed organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fit perfectly with the time period a utter example of how le can be far more effective
1	come on it led zeppelin d
0	a great dumb song i loved this dumb song when i wa a teen in high civilise i think it came out immediately after if i ever i thought the grandiloquent one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine not too long after i became a freshman in college music ha always been a great companion of mine their unison are great harmony a their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song it a classic they remind me of the guy from the disc i think thats my grandparent generation

0	i wa in my twenty when i listened to album it made a very poor impression then but i thought id go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable and others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic of the song this is what i expected what i received wa a of that to ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review isnt about the surviving member of the door provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and for me this is about solving a mystery how could who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest
0	it great to hear an artist expand their horizon i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if know what i mean cant in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave review puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it not to say jewel should stay confined but just because record sale are lagging a bit doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above i believe some call that particular horizon selling out did jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human point of view jewel seemed to be telling u she felt in her i know everyones got bill to pay but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy record company we have one britney spear we dont need anything resembling anther one hope jewel find a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album id hate to think jewel feel she need to her ego

0	what i aboveboard information technology simply and always say is that when a artist ha to come out with sung dynasty a song render they dont actually b complex deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make iodin that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her music it actually hasnt actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely wa not that impressed with comprise the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d
1	this is ideal music for easy listening it play considerably a background or for intent listening eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ considerably her song are considerably chosen have depth meaning fortunately she doesnt try to showcase her entire range in each song like some other talented singer such a celine dion mount whitney houston mariah carey this make eleanor far more pallitable for lengthened listening she outshines almost all other female vocalist her cd are hard to find so if you see one bribe it you wont regret it i would love to see more from this creative person including original work

1	record album amazing album
1	wa a year filled with social unrest and the music in this hour long cd reflects that from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection born to be wild by steppenwolf to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation on through the mournful abraham martin and john by dion this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr but even in the uneasy social climate of respite wa found in music there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees and the gorgeous slow dance soul ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics this cd focus on the hit so if youre looking to delve deeper into the music of look elsewhere but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the s
0	didnt like this album totally hated la llave de mi corazon it sounded like the song you would try on a burger king commercial why add the english lyric there is no call for for it im totally disappointed and deleting from my ipod get all of his previous material because it really world class
1	air return with love their expert lick in my opinion since s moon on campaign the daniel chester french couplet have withdraw a more experimental advance to this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pour down tune to date with sing sang sung with this case of line notable from quite an betimes arrange on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from cycle legend with it multi layered synth head and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simpleness though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a nifty chord progression and melody the orchestral bell add an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the terminal of moon on campaign especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my dearie at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound air hole symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or understand someplace that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd opine air would create with it western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it play but also lack specialization on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this arrange right pretermit the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to create some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparing with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album recollective tune and one of the expert in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regard to lyrical absence ive always been one to take to air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to create a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two flex into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slow down down into an ambient tableland reminiscent of something off talking picture walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it swirling advance especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal preferred and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a nifty beat to it intersect the electronica soundscapes of cycle legend and supply the piano driven feel of the majority of air hole symphony and you have this nifty combination of ambience and almost down pacing like rhythm a nifty addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this well air most accessible pour down song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is well one of the expert on the entire album simple yet so efficacious in it delivery there just enough line between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get somebody into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing arrange of the album once again i find myself being remind of the later half of moon on campaign with this one new star in the sky chanson stream solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and laid endorse in it advance this tune is a near perfect night song with it distorted harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and get you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closemouthed african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it hand piece guitar segment and it movement line horn melody it a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly discharge interest and keep you listening to the last note a nifty way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the terminal but im not ruing out a higher score it definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really inebriate in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who been hanging for a different advance fomr these daniel chester french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously unloosen id say cycle legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole new mart denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me

1	k is most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it be i am often an admirer of period there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why
0	i love dt i respect them for taking a chance simply but this album doesnt work for me i suspect that i would enjoy it more record album if i give it more time but im just not interested in investing the time right now

0	it great to hear an artist expand their horizon i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean cant get in to this pop deluxe stuff some of the rave review puzzle me this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it not trying to say jewel should stay confined but just because record sale are lagging a bit doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above i believe some call that particular horizon selling out did jewel sell out here i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti estblishment and human point of view jewel seemed to be telling u she felt in her heart i know everyones got bill to pay but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy fat record company we have one britney spear we dont need anything resembling anther one i hope jewel find a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album id hate to think jewel feel she need to serve her ego
0	im all for freedom of speech but this song is just shock value not yarn dye impressed
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i didnt like any of them including this call i guess it wa worth the price
0	i like to pick out song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program i cant find here just when i think i like what im hearing they find a way to blow the deal almost every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road recalculating weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd they can surely play but need some serious direction will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid these guy could use his help and get a singer could end up being somebody
0	were only a few song i liked not what i expected
0	this digital copy seemed to be poor quality i purchased it after listening to it a a billion time on on you tube and it just doesnt sound the same excellent song but ill continue to use the the youtube version
0	i have been a huge fan of scout chicago for the past year and i must say i first class am very disappointed with this album like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist robert lamm terry kath and peter cetera however a most fan know the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in comprise the late seventy little girl and commercial grade early eighty so sir thomas more one might ask what wa i expecting michigan for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow although im sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement he didnt contribute a single song robert winnow contributed very little trump too if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live you will agree that this band still ha it i have to wonder what they have been doing from a compositional standpoint for the last year robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion s p is an excellent effort and in many way it ampere seems more chicago than xxx why couldnt robert have saved some of his material i e somewhere girl for medicine this new release instead iodin the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did there are some funky mix here but what are they they sure dont seem too chicago and then there are the horn everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction while the horn seem to ampere be wonderfully integrated on lamms s p on xxx they seem require to be an added afterthought forced and contrived also the cheesy s percussion mixing sound of their hot single musician mix free just make it seem a if instead of trying cloth to create inspiring music a they once did they keep are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single these guy are talented musician they dont need to prove themslelves to anybody where is their integrity simply put i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity
1	just what i needed to get into the spirit of the vacation absolutely love it so nice and mellow highly recommended
0	i thought this wa sung my dottie rambo didnt like it since it wasnt i wa after hers not someone el
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no this cd is for it will remind you of tom goad which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it though i listened to springsteen for twenty year i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work never cared for and i do not like any of springsteens solo work if you like busa etc you will not like this cd some of this material could have interesting if they had been recorded a rock song i gave the cd two star because it wa made by springsteen
0	the cd wa just okay im from chicago and i do it house music but this wa kinda lame a lot of the song sound alike but the bass is booming im a dancer and i can only use about of the cover im glad it didnt cost a lot
0	hunky dory ok
0	this is terribly embarrassingly boring i know that phil spector isnt dead yet but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he been subjected to this rebel biker jagoff bupkis if you thought garbage wa garage you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for ohio an entire landfill in either case take my ohio river advice and nix head in the opposite direction in out of control is nothing more than disney music for the cutting set the stuffed toy market most definitely also extends to the suicidal fantasy demographic cotton candy noose and jelly ha beens oh i buried you by all odds today helium indeed

0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which along sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic ampere range this ha become known to harass many a the dreaded loudness war it ha plagued many remasters including in truth nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on involvement his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on purchase youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the cd after hearing iodin the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa creative person pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which entire list the lyric everything package wise is very good and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of iodin the best that ha virtuoso come in quite a while but once i inwards at that place ripped it to my pc using eac my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my angstrom dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend comprise chevvy of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for interest the poor mastering i would have easily given the product a i can detest only hope that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is adaptation essentially the same mix without the volume level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion drum in wretched vocalize particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there

0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap tv game mockery and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i experience this wa a huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside from bash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i experience like it wa done more a an attempt to diddle off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose tv game review on youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise

0	what i and always say is that when a artist ha to come out with a song they dont actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern b voice and sound in her music it actually hasnt actually drove the point home her song without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that make i definitely wa not that impressed with the song and it definitely is fantasia low point song d
0	compared to deems taylor swift cd this really suck
0	what can i say it is absolutely to learn that the super deluxe edition of this doe not contain all of the song released for this album apparently there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available what complete jibberish how can ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium the super deluxe version then not provide all planned content for release while id love to say im shocked mr taylor would sanction this it is apparently one of the many new le than desirable trend the record company have espoused lately to get those few of u left who support physical medium to shell out more dough disgusting

1	honestly i wa never a huge fan of this song the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song one of his front runner he think it really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might try very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day ive always known the lyric were romantic but they have more meaning for me now also this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version his voice doesnt bother me now just go to show how of import tape quality really is
1	this song is awesome
1	i am glad i purchased this selection due the fact that i have been searching for this song and the artist amazon try to provide this and doe such a great job thanks
0	i swear this is a very good parody of bob dylan singing of christmas song it is isnt it please recite me it is please
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tune over and over again everywhere you go this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling delight and an upbeat tune i enjoy listening to this over and over again i would love to early find more of these kind of new tune new to me anyway
1	cabaret still shine well after decade in her day nobody could deliver like liza and cabaret illustrates why you have to hear later it again to understand
0	very disappointed the song i really want it are along not on here but it still a good cd if i had known my song were not here i would not have purchased it
1	it is a good song with nice lyric the beat is slow jam style may help ppl understand to listen to their mate before the relationship in effect come to an end
1	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a great catchy rhythm you may have heard it cover in pitch inwards perfect
0	this ha to be the worst holiday song ever so made i cant believe anyone would actually pay for this i would not even download it for free
0	i read feature of speech some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult then his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering how you estimation can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and antediluvian this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler telling or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
0	patently the title simple plan refers to a possibility that if you rip off another band hit you will sell more record i truly dont know where to start with this one this band rip off every band from u to green day to the killer and manages to wakeless overproduced with a total lack of energy with the exception of one pop punk track time to say goodby it wa said that during the three plus year that passed between album that the group singer songriter ryan bouvier had writer block this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song making simple plan wakeless like a boy band even when they try to rock out the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of pose and there are way too many piano ballad i think any trace of the faux punk label they were slapped with after their first two album which were decent effort carry with pop punk hook can permanently be move out now simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three plus year layoff between album or the change of wakeless style on this new one that killed their career and the answer is neither it is the lack of originality energy and songcraft that will do them in let face it when hilary duff rock harder than you your band is not punk and in the three and a half year this band wa away the scene modify but their fan base remained intact and they should have continue a small closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band vociferation unchartered musical territory perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it this one is steer to a bargain bin approach you right following to all those sure enough lfo album
0	yes this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron initiative steve may be the master composer in initiative but british lion prof that he cant achieve the extraordinary level of an iron initiative album by himself he doe need the other guy also it dissapoints that harris got this singer richard zachary taylor for the album the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is similar the difference between a ferrari and a drum up bicycle im not saying bruce should have been on the album but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and bugger off a decent singer fifty fifty blaze bailey is a good singer he didnt have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron initiative requires but blaze bailey can sing i dont know who told this richard zachary taylor that he could sing
1	the entire cd is greatly of real r b music scream and emergency are two of my although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam tank music in the past ha always been to me but he ha really matured with this cd the thing is he didnt try to conform some of the newer antic with his sound he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate for the lady tank picture inside cover prof to be an bonus for u lol
1	lin manual miranda is an outstanding composer is a remarkable man making history on the stage with history a his inspiration a musical form that allows much in the time
0	this cd ha a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining very depressing her voice crack scrape and she cant quite hit the note buy bonnie raitt instead
1	fantastic possibly his best album however
1	i am a along little late to join the party when it come to this artist but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for thinking out loud on youtube i didnt realize it had been played to emotion death on the radio according to friend i love the cd end it is awesome to find an artist that actually play real instrument writes their own music with lyric that actually convey human emotion wonder never cease
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal hamzigs drumming is fine it nice to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few strong point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feeling demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad and annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which of course is what rap music is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let take a look at each song the lord of steel start off like a dr sue rhyme but ha musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of tone and thats a shame because this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass pro tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed and killed for year it time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre im sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates it own studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will remake this album too
0	it either badly done or just a really bad idea elvis voice sound rough i dont recall thinking that when i heard his original recording it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it take away from his greatness rather than enhancing it i wont archetype be buying any more of the song from this album i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard dont be cruel and couplet hound dog played on iodin my radio over year ago re release more mix of his original if you must priscilla but please dont do anything vocalization like this it if i can dream album again and no duet either it just disrespectful of his memory
0	where is the woodwind obbligato the break obligato strain and whats with the stinger this is not the real go u
0	i attended a workshop return by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappoint to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little menage story bear witness by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a traditionalist fan of laura ingalls wilder book it the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa disappoint further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long wintertime instead of using the lyric leave however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around ithiel town and she hadnt known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little menage series if you are just looking for some instance of pioneer song this album will set the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura bed a she bed it keep looking
1	iv been collecting mucic for over year and let me tell you that this cd super rock this is one cd im proud to have in my collection
1	i have also been waiting for this cd for about year now and now that it is finally out the anticipation is deffinatly worth i this cd it is just a amazing a i had expected it is awsome it is good no matter what type of you usually listen to it is a combinaiton or hip hop and metal it is an awsome combination is funny adn serious so nomatter wht your is you will enjoy it i think that this cd ha just made my month i got it the day it came out and wouldnt have it any other go pick it up now
0	made in aut in serial playing sentence this is album from canada self proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic exit in style and profound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like la singing and la p demonstrates her talent but everything around that is a great letdown from the opening note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the orchestration is introductory poorly recorded but mostly pointless it music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are at time but seldom adequate you habit be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of shelton jackson lee previous album since theyll have nothing to liken it with but if youre somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock or metal queen be careful this sentence try to borrow a copy from someone else first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional lee aaron

1	dynamical
1	great cd by one of the circus tent band around today
1	awsome song
1	excellent
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day im not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the s stuff in fact chicago is one of my favorite compose album by the band and is an album that they have every at that place right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then spent striation the next year releasing various compilation live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could range get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fan were very curious hold out to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound a even if completely coincidental use of iodin triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive course the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able non initialise to create any hit air single with it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but radio wouldnt have played it anyway so why even attempt to go down that path who were they trying to reach with this album and worst of accept all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to recommend on this album for ampere much of anyone record album the song are economic consumption weak and the arrangement and production is tired one peculiar can prominent only wonder why they thought this assay album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place it doe serve to make weak album like xiv and seem not angstrom so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sung dynasty sound of the earliest simply comprise designate inwards stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the s but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting world health organization manner and let be honest even a lot of the material on their early record werent great song but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them totally at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they dont want to which is fine but then it probably best to just limit future along release to compilation and live album
0	did not purchase this book either or whatever it is did not purchase this one rate it sorry
0	what the others say is true i bought this back in the early i it wa nothing but a bootleg cd from an lp no stereo and one song play faster than it should i have the original mercury stereo lp all track were stereo except one just an fyi the stereo lp version of please dont talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released version you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube search for diane ray stereo
0	great version of this tune this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason see however it is represent fuzzy sounding and doesnt quite play through to the end chopping off about second i will try to get a refund it is so much better sitting at theater of operation my home theater watching the credit of the movie the visuals add more than you can know
0	first of all you can barely make out most of what they are sorrow saying the production value are terrible i could have done a better job with a s channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining in blonde fact im pretty sadness sure they recorded it on a year old webcam and mic set up using sound mixing meld emulation software scarce that they obtained in a cracked version secondly the message is stupid they dont really have anything worthwhile to say and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind everything about this band about this album wa a waste of time this is there why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover there no way the music wa going to sell this album
0	trying award this zero star am forced give it one careful most of the review here are for the broadway revival which give high mark this recording is for the london revival the london recording is dreadful truly awful carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung give this one a miss try any of the others you find here instead in fact this is so badly by amazon by using the wrong review im going to ask for my back amazon duly issued a refund within a day of my request and agreed the wrong review are linked to this album they are working on correcting the link if you arrived here from the link on the broadway cast revival cd page this is not the mp album you are looking for at least on july rd

0	i need to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you look up the word music class brass professional and youll see chicago anyone who know me know that chicago is and ha been my favourite group since dirt hand down the only other band closer is the beatles i own every album and every cd twice my key chain say chicago my refrigerator and front door ha chicago magnet inside and out anything with the chicago logo on it get saved need more proof of my loyalty this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i didnt say anything when this group started re issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist singer peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vibrant part of the music scene it is not easy to stay current for year and please everyone when the new guy came on the scene you didnt hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera cetera wa gone jeff wa in and thats that i didnt ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath and frankly i didnt want them to even the drummer tris imboden wa musically right for the fit of this band all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold but folk this is not right chicago ha more talent than this part of me want very hard to salute them for being there for year the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day chicago and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago i dont know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my mom said that if i didnt have anything nice to say then i shouldnt say anything but i am not getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one usually i am stoked and cant wait to tell a friend i may have to pull the shade and bolt the door and turn off the telephone thank goodness i have other chicago album to listen to better luck next time fella maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen

0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl that might be true but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with comprise there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album they all are a mediocre at best rating nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of and then being added to the listing of jackyls best of usually i like comprise sung dynasty when jackyl do cover version but even everyones a winner here is a doh song that is just meh not a song i liked before and still non dont the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final along one but then again how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song enough with the rev it up and go already the same can constitute be said for just because im drunk it just a watered down version sung dynasty of secret of the upwards lead off bottle i dont get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs the song sound silly with lyric rally rally rally uga chugga ugga chugga really wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that year old dancing baby animation thing not to mention the chorus seems bouncing to be something they slapped over another song and it sound saltation out of place together this album ha failed to rock me roll me or jackly me lead off off in any way sure the comprise production is good but you know what they say about something comprise in particular that you can polish the attempt at trump a deeper sound of metal too doesnt seem right for jackyl it sound more like them trying anything to keep current and thats not why fan stick with them i havent given up hope and think jackyl can still bounce back but they sure are not the same band they once where they comprise really need to find themselves again and work out what made comprise their first couple of album great nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic

1	can you wait eff this song have been waiting on this cd to come out for a long time worth the wait
0	eh more fluff than nub
0	not what i wa expecting quite the opposite of what i wa hoping from this collection looking for upbeat and postive
0	so speculative and not in a good way
0	i am not a fan of the vocal being redone i liked the original much more listen before you buy
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were team up with aesop for the rd felt release ive only listened to it about time but my first depression were of disappointment one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were enceinte from beginning to end this thing ha me hop track and allay not impressed im a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining there is a ton of talent in this trio but it just doesnt mesh in this album
1	ampere a ok
0	im not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set but ddamn s pretty sad omission here slayer fan start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog this is a waste
0	wow dont know what happened here usually i have no problem with amazon downloads but this one suck not crisp instead dense it got a fuzzy dull quality doe terrible justice to this excellent tune
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and i agree with the reviewer who prefers to original when the were not costume and this wa a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat the original
0	very disappointed the song i really want it are not on here but it still a good cd if i had known my song were not here i would not have purchased it
1	manakin moon is a great song from the mostly overlooked band waxing poetics who were a regional favorite in the norfolk virginia area it a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind highly recommended wannabe singer just try to learn the lyric on this one
1	the band perry is amazing and i think this is their best song withal followed closely by hip to my heart listen to this song once and you are hooked
0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base inwards i have get a line been a fan for over point year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album vox populi like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound dylan painfully inadequate the only song on this entire father christmas cd that work is must be santa which should have plethora been released a a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show have become testify incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing register those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the accept time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the rather stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter
0	every song sound the same
1	i found this worship cd in a store randomly it ha some of the best praise and worship song ever i cant help but get up and praise my god when i hear these song what a sung dynasty blessing
1	for me all but one song made for a very good cd their voice are growing in depth and it different music from their first cd some like my father who loved their first cd because it wa all of the italian favorite and he is italian didnt like this second album at all my husband and i liked it very much

0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time and one of my favorite artist relinquish a well so i wa so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song but i wa in truth horribly disappointed when i heard this song information technology i really expected better from her than this in the past i would have female person bought a shania cd simply without bothering to preview it first because i knew that it would be really good if not excellent when shania finally release her next cd ill definitely preview it first and if it a bad a today is your day i may not even bother buying it
0	music is terrible comprise to boot
0	love the candela but no booklet
0	to a fault too expensive
0	it unfortunate that there isnt a negative rating scale the disc took five to both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging recycled day it arrived
0	i wouldnt download this piece of dung if they were giving away free digital downloads of it always hated this song the other day it wa being played at work and i felt like jumping out the window or at least leaving the building for a breath of fresh air
1	ive seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over campaign the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the aspiration shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it it certainly a star sure a shooting effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this may be a top effort comprise from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	liked it when i ampere wa a kid cool her version roughly of michael jackson almost exact now im blown by it she ha such a way about her no wonder prince and quincy jones and whitney houston and all the rest admire her talent
1	this is a very good cd for the price i bought this cd just for that one song that i didnt have but wanted
1	blue outstanding bluish
0	not what i wa looking for i wanted a reading of the sanskrit the word for word definition and the translation the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature so the star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking also i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires the sanskrit mantra when they are present and accurately read are music enough
0	heard this download on a movie and really dug the lyric havent really listened to it since i downloaded it the intro wa too long for me and i dont like the vocal they are shaky like there is hardly any talent once i heard pic the whole song the lyric arent a impressive a when i along heard it on the movie
1	i like this album it great im year old and i love this album all of the beat are really great and the language are really great and cent is a really good rappper and i just love this cd cause it so good this is what rap music is all about really good beat and really good language and really good rapping cent is the unspoilt rapper ever i listen to this cd every day after school while im eating my nosh compact and find out sister sister on the wb it good my mummy bought it for me for my birthday along with justin timberlakes new cd thats great too i love both cd but cent is especially good
0	would rate this cd a ok for the money there are better sounding out there this ha the mix which sound flat and lifeless it ha bonus track ironically from the u which are already on the album a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like ill get you baby it you i give it star out of a
1	very good song
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of album and dvd a well a very disappointing album i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened now this eric adam doesnt sing lyric it sound like he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing best vocalist in metal hamzigs is fine it to hear him perform something other than bh song i never thought would say this but logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album it simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe dare i say he may be playing with some sort of feeling one of the few point of this album it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk i met him ok time to someone feeling demaios bass sound like a or using a slide to play the note it pretty bad annoying every song it sound the same i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an is this his attempt at dub step it certainly isnt the true metal sound the production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch for an interesting speaker or headphone experience one thing edm ha that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to attempt doom metal black list you need that deep bass sorry put the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many song about viking which should be left to amon amarth and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric i can never forgive all men small boy and if someone explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at time they remind me of dr sue rhyme which course is what rap is like the only standard manowar formula thing this album is is song about a harley maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album let take a look at each song the lord of steel start off like a dr sue rhyme but musical moment lazy lyric writing poor opening song to an album manowarriors again ha musical but we heard these lyric before another disappointment i expected a good anthem like warrior the world nope born in a grave finally some lyric and music that are different not a bad song the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it at this point i ask why isnt eric singing righteous glory first mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to erics vocal better on this one he can sing so let him i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album touch the sky the bass is ridiculous on this song it like an incessant hum of tone and thats a shame this is one of the better song on the album like i mentioned demaios bass playing demand an explanation black list attempt at doom metal that fall flat humming bass that sound like edm drumming could have been heavier a well lyric arent good and vocal sound pro tooled this song could have been very good expendable a pathetic sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie will a lot of money this is the type of song that requires a s movie fight training montage support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites an incredible loss of power in his voice did something happen to his voice that i dont know about el gringo this is a song that sound like a taco bell commercial head for the border annihilation dr sue rhyme s atari activision video game sounding bass tooled vocal disgraceful hail kill and die now that they have hailed killed for year time to die duly noted channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album and arrange them in a paragraph the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place really douche chill inducing the kingdom of steel a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job even i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general i hate i didnt download it for free before purchasing it this is more of a novelty like panther and there are better band in the true metal genre im sure their european live show are amazing but really need to take a step back with the studio album anytime a band creates studio the music suffers much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died this band is not the same since ross the bos i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he couldnt take it anymore technology ha ruined this band they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time i really want to love this band again he need put aside the ftw ill do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing blah blah but you cant argue with crazy some people believe the earth is and they will never be convinced maybe in year he will this album too
1	fell in love with this song on ghost i had to do some research to find the actual song a it not on the album but im glad i found it it so pretty and the singer ha a beautiful
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp or standard candle i like the mp option since many cd album only contain a couple keepworthy song

1	such ampere a beautiful song
1	great product great seller
1	i bought four of these two for myself just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates i have a vast sinatra collection this is one of the top disc the others being only the lonely swinging lover september of my year and the live at the sand being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find having all these song in one collection is long long overdue
1	i needed to refresh myself on the lyric i sang this song at a best friend wedding in the s then at his son and now for the daughter crazy thing is when girl i wa younger john babble out denver wa a good friend i miss him still
0	sound quality is poor probably original it would be better if the track had been remastered at least you get to hear the way the music sounded by the original band at the time they were produced
0	i listened to the sample this recording and wa struck how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made her interpretation can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what is to lose a love in life after a relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and wound have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just nor she willing to curse god and
0	garbage joe derosa is not a funny man
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash ha everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand

0	wow im really disappointed in this i guess im just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the band sound muddled and uninspired i get the impression they are going through the motion which are and could really care le what they put out roth sound soooooo bad it really embarrassing and im not excited about the it not that it a bad set list but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore album worth of material a if it happened and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh play of a new album they were proud of they did dying to show it off there are song on adkot that are just begging to be played live but im guessing well never hear em shame to put this out and not have cut like big river you and your blue or beat workn on here a terribly retreaded and unoriginal a adkot wa i still enjoyed the quiet a bit i play it often and it ha some great song to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of day light what a shame ill pas i own about every vh cd thats released had iii but got rid of it but ill pas on this one still listen to the studio cut heck daves last solo wa pretty good but ill pas on the live money grab thank you much
0	i bought this song on itunes casual trying to respecect the copyright law however the import processing is confusing and i still have no alike idea how to put this on my computer i thiink the system should be more user friendly because if along i cant figure it out normal folk that use this service everyday like my parent who are le computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer

1	barb still ha all the same it
1	if you want a variety of beethoven music this is an excellent selection beautiful beautiful music relaxing uplifting moving it just doesnt get any better
1	this is a wonderful soundtrack for a beautiful and thoughtful show highly recommended that you see the testify show currently playing in lahaina maui hawaii
1	critic have called this the best soul album ever theyre right this is the best non greatest hit soul album one can buy outstanding singing precision producing make not this a cant miss album the album record album turned look like a greatest hit package with ghetto child smashing one of a kind love affair how could i let you get away ill be around and others the first track just cant get you out of my mind get you going and you wont be able to turn it off
1	when you can to the whole album nonstop over and over then you know youve got a good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing at the same time slightly rockin id say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes with girl vocal and harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper and in brightly wound where stacy sherri sing two completly different and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony every song ha it moment of pure joy and satisfaction it just make feel good simply put it just good listening good music for the ear
0	ill pressure start iodin off by saying i like blink and also alkaline trio when i heard skiba joined the band i figured complaint we would get a awesome mesh we didnt i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark very mediocre effort there are two john l h down song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy i get that the album is project named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore let grow a little
0	not so much only one or two song i enjoy too all over the place a far a music go
0	in the record album late s there wa a favorable yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album but they were not in the same league with yes starcastles arrangement were softer virtuoso le articulate and their lyric were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know star stuff aspirant galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist but what wa the point i regret to say in truth this but fly from here sound like starcastle it yes light im glad theyre still out there working on all the same new material but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i posse this is for one of two listener either the yes come out completist or someone who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a great album imo
0	far too sappy vastly overproduced where is the rawness fire of the earlier day tremendous dissapointment the only good thing about it is i dont own it a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic boy did i get the short end
0	one song thats listenable but they changed from it alter original composition shame
1	this song is amazing
0	it either done or just a really bad idea voice sound rough i dont recall thinking that when i heard his original recording it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match it take away from his greatness rather than enhancing it i wont be buying any more of the song from this album i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard dont be cruel hound dog played on my radio over year ago mix of his original if you must priscilla but please do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duet either it just disrespectful of his memory
1	i love it thanks the arrived on time and wa a described
1	diana krall is a real cool chick on this number
0	this track doesnt work played once and that wa it gave one star because i received a prompt refund hope this help
0	the novelty wear off very quickly a couple of listens and i wa done with it
0	this is the worst description on the south ive ever heard my recommendation to any true southern is dont by this disgusting garbage i cant package it up fast enough to get it out of my house
1	ill start off by saying that im one of those completist type i have away to own everything by maybe a certain band or person i mention this because a renown man named john dwyer is a highly principal member of yikes a well a at least other band i own everything he done and i have to peculiar admit this particular album get the most play youll know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame he did yikes right after coachwhip and it show it extremely thick reverb soaked screaming madness but the catch is that it much slower it not psychobilly or punk but extremely loud thick heavy drug induced blue type stuff with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note do yourself a serious lewd favor and pick up both to the lowest degree yikes album right now theyre quite short but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came so i kinda feel like ive grown up with her first her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time dont even compare in vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who didnt get a chance to really show off her or her real personality with her first album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she do on her own term and in her own word stripped is my absolute favorite album all time she sang from the heart and experience she took u on a journey of finding her own voice the figurative and sense writing her own song and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott wa one of the thing shes ever done career wise i dont know what happened between but she hasnt been the same i fell in with on stripped though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic wa a huge fail even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it but they are nowhere near memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual but either need to retire from music or get it together
0	if you are a tango terpsichorean or calciferol j looking for a collection of the most danced to tango in either the u s or genus argentina you will be sorely disappointed with this collection it contains few if any of the the essential golden era hit instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure non danced to listening only tango early gardel piazzola etc that you would almost never want to play at a milonga calling the collection essential tango is deceptive at best avoid it
1	brilliant i have not seen the show hope to some daytime but the music alone is phenomenonal
1	love it best vocal on history oh my gosh
1	love this song
1	not really a fan of the artist but i do like this great to listen to when im at the gym for motivation
1	great album they have such wonderful voice i wish i iodin could sing like that

0	not my non stile
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent but the cd no longer will play only played it twice now no longer work i guess you get what you pay for applies here
0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic rock magazine issue march it purport to be a collection of strain that have been lost in clock overleap gem and curio that power be of interest to hard rock fan ummm well part of that plan ha been achieved they are surely curio curio from the realm of apathy generation because thats what youll believably feel when listening to these track sure tucky buzzard ha had some reason to exist and a few of these track power pique the interest of the occasional aficionado but much of it so eclectic it hard to see anybody listening to these number and thinking to themselves hey i got ta get down me some more strain by the aynsley dunbar retaliation and i dont wont to dis this taster even though thats what im doing it just that multitude into these band believably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl and nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted if you get down my drift anyway i played this once and that wa a chore
1	great album they have such wonderful i i could sing like that
1	i dontknow why but i love this vocal
1	it pretty good had it playing outside the front door halloween night good mood maker
0	i have bought music through amazon preferring them to itunes because because itunes try to control their music too much however after the latest mp purchase i find it now amazon ha made it a difficult a possible to download their music to my itunes bye bye amazon i depict guess im gon na have to go back render to angstrom the itunes store a much a i hate to
0	i am so sad that this record is bad i love metallica and excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock however you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record my old record have a very full sound they are yr old but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level it is like the speaker wa blown very very bad to the point of me being able to enjoy the music oh well thats what i get for paying only for a vinyl
0	wheres the banjo wheres the awesome make me live music there not one song on this album that compare to anything or any one song you have done in the past whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong do what you love not what other people want this is definitely not what i expected i just got this today on your release day and couldnt skip through it fast enough very disappointed
0	great version of this tune this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason however it is fuzzy sounding and doesnt quite play through to the end chopping off about second i will try to get a refund it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credit of the movie the visuals add more than you can know
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it a shame what pass hip hop these day people to be more in love with weezys production than lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care the lyric all because lil wayne is whack im not a hater i dont gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he just another average untalented stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record are trying to pas off a hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i a little more substance in my music
1	product delivered a described ship send time wa expected
1	for what it is ampere it is a great tune sung by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic brilliant
0	the mix roughly on this song is awful the background noise take over which tell me they are trying to hide a lot of flaw in nias voice she is from the t v show dance mom and should have let abby lee miller produce her song abby a she doe in everything that she work on put out excellence song for the girl she produce nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby a this song is come out awful even the totally title is bad what doe a year old know about staring in flashy your own life the cover is tacky it look like they used microsoft word to spell nias name in shadow bad all the way around save your money and order kendall vertes corrupt song wear em out now thats a great song and you can buy front it on amazon for cent your picture on the cover should have been centered sorry nia im afraid a music background knowledge career is not little girl for you
1	excellent new music
1	beautiful give thanks thank you
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album take notice that all artist writer actor musician painter etc etc have world health organization to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high accept survival rate artist like jewel have to project different image twenty four seven whether it their look and or work moreover change can sometimes be difficult to accept but thats life nothing stay the same everything change consent however thats how artist the entertainment business simply operates too artist are product pawn of an industry that control their every move just enjoy the music and have fun

0	i so much wanted to love this album dylan a sinatra he must really believe that he francis albert sinatra doesnt sound bad but it wa painful to simply listen to the off key croaking i love dylan and ive been a fan of frank for a long time the longing and emotion were somewhat evident but the bob dylan production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too angstrom much i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i can drive along the ocean with my window open

0	ive been a dylan fan from way back and im also a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what ha happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these song and im tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra best im a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not recommended for dylan fan and certainly not recommended for sinatra fan
1	i absolutely love this album forever i play it constantly these song are just perfect
0	the record wa warped

0	this review is directed at the a opposed to the actual album do not buy from new chapter recycling this record shipped in a plain white cover and damaged at that instead of the original cover a seen in the pic ridiculous sending back and ordering from another vendor

0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it it too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal
0	ac dc fan will love to rock out with the master of rock the recording are great the hit keep coming song after song
1	what a fantastic gift from the fiord this cd is astoundingly well crafted every note seems perfectly placed the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music generally this is soft warm lulling music but it doesnt put you to sleep toxic girl is catchy jangly and rhythmic without ever seeming pretentious or overproduce sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it there is a real soothing quality here though that cant be denied buff of low and air should be quite proud of
1	it prince plain and simply a legend rip
0	absolutely horrible pressing save your money and just go astatine with the remaster i got this on a daily deal but even at information technology that price it wasnt worth it sound distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range the bass is nonexistent and wa quieter than most of my other record ive listened to it about time now just to see if it needed to get a line break in a bit nope just horrible
0	racialist racist
1	awesome song
0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting it terrible ok let start it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a stone classic in every single sense of the word it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that dont deserve to be here more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting then some classic that dont really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother fool to cry respectable and the last time really better song than cant you hear me knocking moonlight mile let it bleed and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby dont stop over album cut like sway bitch and monkey man i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career but they should really focus on the golden year rather than equal time allowed for these awful s cut hell i mean even we love you little red rooster and heart of stone are bad choice look i know i have a bias i love these boy disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into they are inarguably the single greatest rock n roll band of all time but even a a major major fan i wouldnt recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone i cut my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band it basically the same story here although they were smart enough to add she wa hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the music obviously i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great stuff but dont get this album it not worth the price find a friend who love the stone if youre smart youll have a few and ask them to make you a mix or get lick used for a couple buck just stay away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up im going to my room and putting on sticky finger
1	not really a fan of the artist but i do like this song great alike to listen to when im at the gym for motivation
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son in law a a joke because it is all the star review crack me up particularly the one from the holy than hard core dylan fan particularly the one who are ignore their nose down at u critical one who just dont get it lolololol the review are about a think about a the cd itself the star review are so serious unconvincing same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read the review there for both camp screaming i dont tending if you are a bob dylan connoisseur youve got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera house singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can spill the bean pop it is horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to spill the bean jazz standard still it is so horrible it is so think about im going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a easily a non musical friend i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are most angelic with them contrasted against bob dylan singing it is most like he hired them to totally mock him ohio isle of man im listening to this a i type it hurt my throat so much just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed isle of man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice
0	lousy quality recording you really have to be a die zappa fan like it i would also say it is best to listen to after or beer
0	ive been a jewel fan for a long long time i saw jewel before she became famous for piece of and fell in love i loved her style her voice her word everything while piece of you will always be my favorite album i still found solice in all the others until now what wa she i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar speaking the crowd with her song her concert were intimate when spirit came out she added a band to her act and while wasnt thrilled i could deal with it because at least she wa still writing those deep lyric that made me shiver at time then about mo ago i went see jewel play and i wa so happy to see that she had ditched the band and wa back to playing with just her her guitar so now later i fear that girl is gone completely i never thought jewel would sell out and write such bland on the surface lyric and pimp herself to an audience that love the poppy meaningless song of britney spear at first when i saw the video for intuition i couldnt believe it wa jewel then i thought well this song seems to be down those who sell out so i that maybe this song wa the only one of it kind on the album but wasnt with the song intuition jewel is a hyprocrit because she ha sold herself to just cash in

0	definitely not his best work song either to rap or slow nothing like his last album it ha to grow on me or a big waste of money
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who know maybe it need more listens the song seems a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would produce with it western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it fun but also lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with regard to lyrical absence ive always been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two turned into one the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there just enough contrast between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and laid back in it approach this tune is a near perfect night song with it distorted harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it hand picked guitar segment and it front line horn melody it a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but im not ruing out a higher score it definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole new market denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me

0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw run and hide it sound like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o k album i rated it star because there wa no star all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad if youre wondering this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the one we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cd

0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true confession it possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
1	excellent single to celebrate the th anniversary keep of the artist that ha been in the top of the chart for the last year this single keep you moving unless you are dead and didnt know it lol excellent

0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace hour my worn out year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mar hotel iodin and have to say that while im a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old mobile fidelity japan pressed year old copy sound much more natural and is ampere superior in panicked almost every way in fact i panicked and comprise bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful associate in nursing seller a few day later earlier last year mofi wa quiet down supposed to re release this album on lp but decided not to at the before last minute and friday music picked up the licensing right instead this reissue isnt all bad though a i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich throughout the recording and the comprise lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at gram it wa pressed terrified at rti in california and very good quality control standard were obviously taken by the staff that produced this recording
1	my new favorite sung
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse they have really grown together a a band the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jason lyric express the comprise importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than unitedly dwelling on the past the vocal are also much by more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing yield this is evident on the track anchor wash and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall comprise he is absolutely electric other highlight on the record are sky is falling am i ever gon na find out and take me away however this raceway a great deal is one of those album where every song is great and can be listened to over and simply over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the listen overall sound comprise of this album is very organic and pure the song will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why im saying it good a string orchestra rescue really fill out this song and help it deliver the evaluate impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus preview it and judge for yourself
0	iodin i remember liking this song when it wa popular yr ago really stunned at what i heard opine when i listened to this usable song and her other work available online from that era and since am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune she flat out every few bar she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice come out is at best very average overall kind of meh
0	i really didnt like the music i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have the few instrumentals were pretty good but the other selection were boring
0	well if this is the best massive attack album then i wont be buying any more nor is this a worthy example of trip hop come out imo this is way overrated i somehow procurer missed out on massive attack back in the day yet i listened to and loved portishead hooverphonic morcheeba sneaker pimp becoming x etc there are a few good track but for the most part it a mish mash maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they range were about half a comprise long in length repetitive running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster speak get dull fast ya know getting a overestimate few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doesnt make a good record
0	im a big katherine cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to katherine cornell soundgarden audioslave and totg fan everywhere this should be a justin timbercrap song
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa it very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard front fan of laura end to end ingalls wilder book it the detail billystick that really count when it came to away the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura wassail had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along saame in the long winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of trusted a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had depend sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit souvenir the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the no more music laura knew a she knew it keep looking

0	aint nothing like crackheads in love brings back memory doesnt it remember when they both hooked up cocaine wa so a hell of a drug
1	i am very happy with this cd
0	lost is right this disc being the covermount not for resale disc from classic rock magazine issue march it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time dominate gem and oddity that might be of stake to hard rock fan ummm well part of that architectural plan ha been achieved they are certainly oddity oddity from the region of apathy generation because thats what youll probably feel when listening to these track sure tucky buteo buteo ha had some reason to exist and a few of these track might pique the stake of the occasional aficionado but much of it so eclectic it hard to see anybody listening to these routine and thinking to themselves hey i got ta get me some more tune by the aynsley dunbar retaliation and i dont habit to dis this sampler even though thats what im doing it just that people into these band probably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl and nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted if you get my drift anyway i roleplay this once and that wa a chore
1	i think this is a huge leap forward lifehouse they have really grown together a a band the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jason lyric the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past the vocal are also much more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range power while singing this is evident on the track anchor and spin on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electric other highlight on the record are sky is falling am i ever gon na find out and take me away however this is one of those album where every song is and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure the will uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you i highly recommend that you give this record a listen
0	most of these are only portion of the song such a verse and the chorus i would prefer the entire song also many are done with a country feel to them not the traditional music you would hear in church i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with and it isnt a hit wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i tune wa time the price

1	one of the best sweet romantic song of all time i think true love wait and true love never grows old or give up and grows sweeter over time
0	i bought album with an open mind i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack mendocino county line that wa the only good track i thought that with the like of sheryl crow bonnie raitt and rob thomas this would be a comperable a the santana compilation i wa sorely disappointed the other celebrity artist sang back up you barely even hear them wa a cheap attempt to in a more diverse audience bringing in the big gun but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror do not buy album unless you want to flush your hard money down the drain

0	it a pretty song with great vocal but im not trusted about the lyric message once i downloaded and listened to it in it entirety i wa displeased sound rather morbid to me not a great choice for a christmas song trusted it ha a christmas atomic number sound but if you really listen it not about anything to do with christmas is it just me or do the selection this year seem kind of dirty thus far i really delight this day of unblock download advent type calendar last year i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest it made for a great collection of christmas song arrangement i wa not familiar with this year is disappointing by comparison
0	most of these are only portion of the song such a verse and the chorus i would prefer the full song also many are done with a country feel to them not the traditional euphony you would hear in church i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with and it isnt a hit wa sword lily i downloaded it from amazon though a i tune wa time the price

1	beautiful music perfect for the holiday season
1	it not the original version but he get close to it i had heard this song dynasty back in and wa very moved by the lyric i inquired at several record store and could never get out who song dynasty it i finally wa able to google it and found the exact song dynasty by eddy grant the song dynasty speaks about the political and ethnic discussion of people of color great song dynasty and potent message a must listen for the cultural sensitive person
0	this digital copy seemed to be poor quality i purchased economic consumption it after listening to it a a billion time on on you tube and it just doesnt sound the same excellent song but ill continue to use the adaptation the youtube version
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk it still above that silent night one that wa re covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone i know how proud and happy mirth must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admire brobdingnagian posterior through song
0	the song are great but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back it it a static filled compressed mess and it pretty hard to listen to whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such simply a potentially good album waiting for sung dynasty the remaster
1	beautiful haunting and take me back in time ani williams is the best when it come to doing her version of egyptian music her music just feel proper
1	i love this flummox cd barbra is amazing
1	from one of my favorite movie this song can bring out so much emotion and feeling love love love it
1	strangely oriental but totally captivating with those five note in the opening absolutely love this one keep up tom rhett
0	i wa very excited for this album to come out i have been a fan of river and the w since childhood im only on my first day of listening but am in shock at the suitable quality big hype over this album and all it saame is is random jammy song put into an album plus ive clarence day heard half of these song in the past with the same quality or better not too impressed but i will always purchase weezer related album for support but after the green album make believe and now this im a bit turned off turned lover in the snow blast off who accept you callin bitch are derive the only worthy song again ive heard these before this album go buy the blue deluxe album it a way better buy
1	saltation music from flo rida ha song lyric right round taken from an older song so if you liek the older song this one ha a modern twist hip hop
0	cd no good in effect no refund
0	i wanted the song so bad that i too ordered the re mix but did not know that it wa the album i don t have a turntable to play it on i have no use for it
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted the amazon downloader would iodin not allow a second try i asked for and received a refund
0	i dont know what she is saying the only conclude i assume is because i do know the song silent night now how do i delete it
0	sample track sounded great but when you listen to the entire cd it one monotonous song after another had luxuriously hope for this but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune belike will give it away if i can find someone who want it
0	i saw this song and artist non on octane from sirius xm whatever i bought is not it these guy seem very angry
0	what the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task make a compilation of magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at end of cd you end up almost an hour of unused space to leave track such a take it away ballroom dancing of war c vanilla sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the heebie jeebies
1	i remember when the four top were popular and i still love them today soon my oldie favorite list will be at
0	i have listened to this new record album a dozen or more clock time now i have gone back and listened to his very first record album to his most current i regular pulled out the videodisk album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very serious record album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the risky there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his birdsong have soothed away many nerve wracking moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new record album is hand down the risky in some way i bid it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this regular though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no st david foster regular though i am not a personal fan of st david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but unitedly solid album and attach birdsong to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserve to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability to write some very moving birdsong the serious one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next record album heck if it wa me i would go game back to the studio instead of go game out on tour and place unitedly an record album that would be nothing le than his very serious many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in respective performance venue could lay the ground influence for such an record album yet there ha to be new material to bring the record album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock and roll pop and classical venue could bring work unitedly to pull off an record album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let hope he performs only two or three birdsong from this record album while on tour and the pillow pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have tot up on the fashion at many of your venue i wanted this record album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so dashing hope by this collection of birdsong without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next record album this doe glow through despite the haphazard collection of birdsong that make up illumination i now look forward to his next record album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy
0	this is not the rengades i am very disappointed it seems that all the renegade mp download have the original title but are not the song belonging to that title
0	i never seen so many of her video like die young that ha nothing but anti christ and illuminati symbolism in them i thought lady ga ga mondana bad if you dont catch it then your being programmed
1	honestly i wa never a huge fan of this song the guy voice too always seemed kind of whiney to me but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song one of his favorite he learn think it really romantic etc not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day ive always known the lyric were romantic but they have in truth more forever meaning for me now also this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version his voice doesnt bother me now just go to show look how important recording quality really is
1	excellent first class cd
1	i really liked this album when it first came out one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch dont give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor it hard to explain each song can hold it own even though david soul is best known a an actor director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this selection
0	definitely not his best work hold out song either to rap or slow nothing like his last album it ha to grow on me or a big waste of money
0	i really dont appreciate amazon not allowing u to use our reward dollar available on our credit card when we buy mp s i dont accrue that many reward credit on my credit card it would be much more fair if could those mp purchase
0	this is only relevant for the vinyl version this is about the piece of plastic itself not the music im a very big panic fan once i saw brendon tweeted about this i preordered it i received it on the day of the release april all good only today i got to listen to it it all just a tiny bit too high pitched playing it in sync next to a digital version of the same song you can hear it and even without first time i played it and i swear i watched this thing like a hawk and cared for it like it wa my child there a lot of jumping in victorious and dont threaten me with a good time
0	not traditional music very really synthesized new native music not what i wa expecting
0	dont expect too much however she wa somewhat effective than others i have heard wa okay but disappointing so so client
1	love roll in the hay love love
1	this is a song that will probably be one that is an all time hit i love everything about it
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas daring famous upper register and is a very successful song most of the vocalization track on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle register track and were co it written by vitas track and aloof written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd inwards it hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it impossible to pick a favorite vitas then cd talk but this board one hovers sung dynasty somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose smashing a reputable seller with the highest rating a minimum of a vitas like many performer especially those from distant land is plagued with pirated disc play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad wheres you there me kuda ti decent tuda ya get on your dancing shoe dont keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half teemingness night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat exceed try not dancing to this one i dare you in short and a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor in trafficker this one street of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i believe in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in this one just techno sound and the voice a instrument

0	for a while it seemed that taylor brainpower swift could do no wrong even those who were not swayed by her away honest to heel girliness have to begin admit that she creates captivating popular song with each album outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false sung dynasty when she came up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with big girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone accept out helium of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort at best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble gum pop princess pop with an infantile attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not grown with her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging backwards eld her song are in effect now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting fountainhead back together the title of the song is already bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the alike doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a hold out beautiful sung dynasty heart felt song and one of my favorite one third from her this time trade come out however luck ha ran out it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca put on black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young age it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of vocalist simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you an accurate parody of the studio apartment song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like this restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever eer ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i fourth dimension wa like yep i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over estimate the american audience anyways the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and me e e e e e that went along her usual chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego centric that can be characterized a those deepness that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while fourth dimension ampere any song on comprise red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of world health organization boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had no more with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back trump to december even worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally he we listen to swift album and because it is comprise recorded in a can studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last come out time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol helium lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the background there ha always been croon argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country clarence day or just pop and it didnt matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this record album album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work with better musician pop her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major argumentation writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly red faced not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and fountainhead take a good look around her being eer ego centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm range for a while but too much fleet of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger agnostic thing upwards than her
1	i play this to help rock my baby to sleep and she must it so calming because it work every time
0	why wa the term so low all the track are mislabeled
0	in the late s there wa a yes inspired wannabee band called starcastle starcastle were goodish they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album but they were not in the same league with yes starcastles arrangement were softer le sound out and their lyric were hairy fairy without ever really getting anyplace you know champion stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist but what wa the point i sorrow to say this but fly from here sound like starcastle it yes light im glad theyre still out there working on young material but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes record album i posse this is for one of two listener either the yes completist or soul who is not acquainted with yes but who enjoys light fluffy spacey extended pop just not a great record album imo
1	i have given a few copy of the cd and guide to family and champion because it brings one closer to the blessed mother and in touch with the jehovah i mind to it driving working out or when i feel i need to quiet myself susan ha really done a great job with this and it is worth the purchase
0	dont buy this not the actual song and is only a partial long
0	you would think that this is the exact same track from the paperman short but you would be wrong it missing the electric guitar that come at during the actual video meaning it is to be present around the mark for the mp for me this omission ruin the entire track disappointed

0	not iodin exactly what i wanted but it ok wow they require twelve mote word before i can leave this review
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their first few collection such a shadow and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much darker evil grating sound it the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding horror movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we get from the light of the sun a nasty burn now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it just fantastically brilliant
0	wow talk about zero originality what do you do when you cant come up with anything original to save your life ripoff an old breaker instrumental what else

1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july at age his legion of fan simply refused to let go from that point to no le than of his rca single release would make the country chart seven of them crossing over to the pop hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country hit single between and of which crossed over to hot six to the contemporary chart which didnt begin until and one to the r b chart never mind the hundred of equally wonderful selection from his many eps and lp all in however id say he did a fairly credible job augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and three more photo jim including one with wife mary at an award ceremony a partial discography of content is also included but without any chart detail all track recorded in included on an early were hit for jim of them pop crossover only track only the country list to early in his of the old standard i love you because wa recorded in and wa first released on the rca victor gentleman jim and in became a country hit a a single too that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in and released on rca victor to country hot a the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit represented here and the one that lead off the disc is four wall country for eight week in which wa his pop crossover however this came country hit beginning in with mexican joe for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o boy so i tend to agree with another reviewer who say that at least one those should have been included an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cut to choose from the best of these included mentioned am i losing you a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart both s still it hard to be critical this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum star

0	not listenable youre better off just donating to get nothing non in return
0	downloaded it but raceway it ha the same defect a the year old cd track
1	when you can listen to the whole record album nonstop over and over then you know youve got a good record album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing and at the same time slightly rockin id say it sound comparable poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard with girlfriend vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send out a chill down your spine comparable stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on stack of paper and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly dissimilar verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony every song ha it moment of pure joy and satisfaction it just make you feel good simply put it just good listening good music for the ear
1	i love everything sings
1	great
0	it didnt work like i call up it would to guide u a we accended to the top of pike peak we had trouble downloading this item
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill over indulgent and just plain set off dull in the most part not a high point in an illustrious career
0	this is a rather strange digest the individual track have little in common other than that they were made for movie this is a amalgamate of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that nail down band sound that mark many sound track this mixed bag ha very little going for it it would have been interahamwe skilful is theyd selected the track in some manner it would have been interahamwe skilful a a collection of music from early film or of more recent film a it is it is a hodge podge that i really cant recommend to anyone
1	guy i wa so commove when i heard thalia wa going to have a new cd and that excitement wa really worth it when i purchase and take heed to this cd all the song are just amazing thalia ha grown a an artist from album to album all i can say is that i recommend this cd to everyone it fantastic

0	sum ha been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually at least close to punk but that nothing really appeal to me rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the pick up some or nofx if you want punk i dont suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back
1	bought this for secret but am getting hooked on the rest still a timely cd came on time and in a corrupt bubble envelope worth a purchase for sure
0	a a fan of tso were looking forward this cd set great when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left very cool there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely musical taste but i must this one wa a bust we never listen to it and had we previewed it definitely never have purchased it
1	love this song
0	bernie the buffoon is an even bigger joke than i thought bahaaaaa
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such slight imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the euphony world history and that they do it so very badly band like the people touching white witch armageddon and the list go on and on were extraordinary one of a kind and yet modern band continue to take those name for themseles then release inferior common boring euphony and await no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in on the name of others pathetic

0	his commentary around the strain on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who live on on the ranch id seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man live on there and hed written the strain for him it wa kind and touching and the strain itself wa neat look for another year at massey hall i am

1	here another release from a band that had been dormant for year so here the monotheist is pure greatness i wa never fan of experimental of celtic frost and while there some experimentation in here to a greater it all work organically to achieve some scary result the album is also full of slow crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale which make one of the heaviest experience youll ever come across the song are lengthy repetitious and thats what make them effective while it hard to classify this opus it safe to say that it a doom metal album there a lot of stuff going on it never get boring listen deep into the music and youll find something new by each listen tom vocal are harsh brutal and mysterious and the production is exceptional great comeback album i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece one of the best album of so far
1	this wa one of my favorite song from the s i have been putting together a playlist of all my favorite s song and this one had to be included
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons cable in the film a trade good a it get you make me wan na be a better man this song embodies what a fair sex want in a relationship from the opening note youll be sucked into the melody and simple lyric that comprise wan na make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day although this song is not written by gibson himself it doe expose music lover to his rich vocal that tickle your spike drum stay tuned for gibson next exclusive written by gibson himself summer back set to be released this month

0	deleted
1	i have this on an lp record and finally found it here the entire collection is great fun with the monster talk their own song
1	is a gift
0	this composition while ambitious and promising at certain point never really take off the composer relies too heavily a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doesnt go anywhere with it the theme never develop and the variation arent all different from each other i had high hope for coda a it seemed that the piece wa to a satisfying conclusion it wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction however
1	no one play this song any better than conductor and violinist andre rieu i first saw him on public television and wa so appreciative of his playing and conduting style he ha feeling in each note he play on his violin i know you will enjoy his music

0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review east why would you say such a horrible thing calling pac wack thats blasphemy right there he wa a real a it get he had quite a few positive song and he wa one of the greatest anyone would agree with me there on to my review of this cd i weep at the current state of hip hop how did we go from notorious big to lil flip hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it pathetic cent doesnt help one bit yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson on going multiple time platinum but why did this album sell so much i think it wa based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he wa shot nine time and lived to tell i mean anyone who say is a lyrical beast is totally assinine this guy is so predictable let see if he talk about selling rock he will probably mention something about glocks in the next few word and if he mention hoe he will probably mention about him doing show and if he mention you get my point he is such a bad lyricist if he came outta the south id understand but coming from queen ny is respected a the breeder of lyrical genius but is trash stop talking about how ja rule is he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed youre the wanksta cuz u never got back at him this album get it star because the beat are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guy living off of his shot story i love how people gave him the name and called a snitch cuz it true new title for this album get or die cry
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the term it is offered i have no regret about this purchase
1	this is by far the best collection of rare earth there wa i say wa co it look like at the save of this that it is now out of photographic print sad luckily i do own it what make this the best one of all is the inclusion of every now and then we get to go on down to miami this song wa never released a a single but should have been every song on here is a winner youve stupefy the hit and the best of almost album track but if mowtown occur to read this please please release the entire catalog using bit these guy deserve it since there or master copy member gone now

0	given guitar player emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only master holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the vapour magoos that enjoin like the herald set s neer going back to peach state anyone expecting to hear a set of service department and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with master vapour magoos producer bob wyld these six caterpillar track featured most of the short letter up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these caterpillar track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big vapour magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this collection found thielhelm and fellowship throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix caterpillar track like easy down sundown cant get plenty of you and the instrumental magoos vapour were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz roam leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo gaudy move flatulent horn and aimless vibraphone may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the narrow cant get plenty of you simply horrifying adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a in particular good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a vapour number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most rivet performance in the negative column the song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating adept easy down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the gaudy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibraphone and fleshy percussion ultimately killed it okay the break wind sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating adept and then there wa the plus narrow epic cant get plenty of you the song actually pop out sounding pretty good skillful funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead on this a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo suppose a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll get laid what this sounded like rating adept penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos vapour showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this technically it wa rather impressive with lot of space for someone solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating adept tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free physique overindulge but to my ear it basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b double u sea breeze express abc catalog sporting of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help gross sale all secernate a lamentable footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing face gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm easy down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get plenty of you eric kaz face magoos vapour instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone worry the vapour magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to striation be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music cosmos wa about entertainment it felt good to listen to life good afternoon wa eld good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again experience everybody wa hold out miserable nobody had any fun any more bide if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making music for entertainment purpose only sec and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an s thing to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to inwards like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in aboveboard chain cd and i clinical depression burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock iodin band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year bide and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing matter music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it good afternoon cause depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge

1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this first off it is it feel even heavier than gram mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup last song louder than word the with vocal there did seem to be a bit of sibilance that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment a far a the actual ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about of way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there are no rift like are present in momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the that is because it one of those album that is obviously meant to be to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album it nothing spectacular but it a well put album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i appreciate it even more after additional listening
0	im so disgusted with amazon this season of the christmas are offensive explicit and revolting and it not even a week into december i saw that it wa lady gaga so i wa wary at first but i decided to pas on the preview a chance light me up and frame me on top really amazon really christmas spirit includes carol wintery atmosphere giving etc not sexual innuendo so disappointing esp after the first great vocal by casting crown

0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys there wa a recent press release about cheap legerdemain sean john lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album this is not it this is one guy and his guitar covering wilburys song dynasty the guy is uncredited in fact everybodys uncredited there are no liner note no credit for the guy singing or the guitar player which im guessing are the same person no songwriter credit not even a record label name just a list of the song dynasty and not in the order that theyre on the cd im not sure how legit this package is his voice and guitar playing are passable he kind of sound like a higher register steve earle his reading seem to miss the point of the original by slowing down cool dry place to a severe dirge he veil the intended goofy fun the same go for dirty world the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor thats completely missing he doesnt miss altogether plow with care piddle it a a ho hum tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly relish of hot and bothered without benefit of drum or electric guitar hey if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune i would think he rocked but a whole record of this one guy is hit and his anonymity not even a wilbury codename piddle it a bogus enterprise id label this for completists only but im a wilburys completist and this is i wish i could get back

1	phenomenal recording on th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with other two member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged evans all six selection on the album were written ahmad and he produced it a well jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd it command premium in the collector and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician i remember when i had the track of this back in the s that i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doesnt come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format which i have done with many out of print vinyl album still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal play jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous horn and string by evans two of the piece pasture and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill a well my favorite piece on the album swahililand is the longest at almost ten and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by on his steinway with the background horn and string before kick in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on al ternating from left channel to right jamal then finish the piece on the steinway after it wind down the tour de force it the track on the album and close it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals over the year and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal play jamal is my of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of jamal jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover sound better than ever

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex and difficult to bring off of mozart piano concerto a true concerto for wreathe instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive performance from this minor orchestra in itself a noteworthy feat while searching out nearly every pianistic nuance of this unparalleled knead some might question whether this is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but there is a difference between period and basically eternal forgive the old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend now one can imagine why

0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel same ive grown up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people crataegus laevigata not count her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas sentence dont even equate in vocal range she had such a big voice for a pop star who didnt vex a chance to truly show off her skill or her real personality with her first album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own term and in her own quarrel stripped is my absolute favorite album of all sentence she sang from the heart and great experience she took u on a journey of incur her own voice in the figurative and literal mother wit writing her own song and working with the people she wanted to make with teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing shes ever done life history wise i dont know what happened between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced make it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic wa a huge fail even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped there crataegus laevigata be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i afford it star but they are nowhere near memorable it truly absorb because xtina is a truly talented individual but either she penury to retire from music or vex it together

0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his deliverance wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut ala true confession fell short of the mark the beginning single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa deplorably replaced with a slow jerky style on most of true confession it possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample and tucker the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track kitty cat which sample george william jefferson clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the deliverance by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however

0	i purchased non this by accident i do not like her music which is too explicit i can not say i hate it because that would put me on the fence with love hate
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp it is the live from the chuck berry film hail hail rock roll it misleading to label it re mastered when it is a different version from the original
0	the live version is not the version i need do not care for all that talking during the song i deleted it
1	great song ive then always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k pax it wa so unlike the many other hit front she ha released over the year the music early itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie comprise is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it just the score so look elsewhere for this great song simply trust me you wont be disappointed
1	beautiful sung
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever heard a must for those who collect this type music
1	great to listen to for my daughter and the lesson through life also smash mouth drive knocked down but i drive back up again
1	the pianoforte is very subtle and haunting almost i love the pause in between and the beat it all gel together i love the song buy in
1	good quality sound and it wa the original enjoyed listening to this took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio
1	ive got to admit ive had this cd since it first came out i am just writing a review now better late than never i give the cd is star yes it is a mellow cd but it is awesome just like paul stanley kiss solo cd my personal simply favorite wa the most mellow of the four his song i feel were the stongest just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song acquire the comprise vocal and the playing is top notch paul is a master craftsman of song bus he always writes the best music then put his songcrafting ability to it definatly a star cd this is paul stanley at his best rock on
0	so i know there are two dirty word in the song and i wanted the clean version that you hear on the radio so i could listen to it even if my child pop into the room but instead of using word like radio edit this one us cartoon effect very weird just a you are getting into the song that pop up wish i wouldnt have bought one
0	not a favorite i prefer a more celtic sounding version of this song i wa disappointed in this version sorry
0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album bluntly talk it is a john major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize bingle western way or killing metre or waisters and melted on the blunted cd if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other bingle then stop probing for this cd right now this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already if you require to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to woof up some old soul ii soul i try killing metre on a community channel on cable it wa being broadcast by a radio station this song by itself put me on the trail of trip hop a journey that took me through massive attack portished craig armstrong tricky and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down seriously disappointed with the current direction
0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is not swell done the transition are terrible most of the call do not have any relevance from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who look to sell million of record were in bad sample musically this cd take that to a whole other level
0	i expected more musical growth from the band
0	i thought my having just downed a hard cider wa making me hear this song in some distorted way but after reading everyones review i now see it not me on a buzz this song is just horrible it off key the vocalist inwards cant carry a tune in a along bucket and is that the sound of cat fighting in the background a frank barone from everybody rack up love raymond used to say hooooly crap thank god it free and i give thanks could hit cancel on the download
0	i thought karaoke lyric came with the music early id buy more if i knew the lyric came with it a in other karoake music
1	nice change for adam

0	hurt my head im too old for trusted this at for sure
1	i do not pretend to be familiar at that place with the detail of tanes career aside from what uncanny i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era release because theyre a little difficult to inwards find but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the simply impression that harmonise for hetero her manager or producer confine roughly whatever wa trying to roughly nudge her into alt rock that tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder comprise edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well suited for it the hetero album is something that fan air of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity because simply although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried pop rock treasure since there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back start with a strange almost playful come out verse take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression pick up a stark thin drumbeat wishing then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything cleaning lady ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later creative person some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain exactly abbreviated why but her voice reminds me of comprise phoebe snow information technology maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even elementary year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful it floating upbeat transitional comprise chord groove between verse and fourth dimension chorus there a satisfying gnarly in reality twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just wishing an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard course to describe again it vocal over sung dynasty acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me but the vocal melody comprise in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer air running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the only first happy discovery you will comprise experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum comprise drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral ampere catalyzing element of the mix how comprise or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic greek chorus spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and then and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me understand ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that wish well three chord figure in jimis wind cry mary whether thats thinly incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but altitude undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have to push that dispense annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those song thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that build plumage to it own sir thomas more crescendo with tane pouring heart and swot soul into the vocal to end on that same soft a a feather place it started this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa vocalization the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a song thats been with you for year that folk is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my iodin all time faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the virgin the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album fan mostly because sec of the chorus which have song tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman i wan na be your nigh woman it not a horrid song but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst cue there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka smashing no kage shadow in the assent middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than represent musicality just simply a guess instead since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed rock and roll through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo eld groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the harmonise rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot first of her tune i like from later album hetero is fifty fifty her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is appeal rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the magical classic song it beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal christmas carol spotlight and meld quite charming it one of my personal favorite the others are good too ample in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is song about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her all the same vocal shine throughout many of the track and her good sense irresistible meld attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
0	ampere sound quality very low but a great classic song

1	i absolutely love this song they sound awesome together being a woman with a busy job and a husband with the same this song make ended sense to me

0	i just finished download from the cloud and there a problem four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the bad track are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i try to open them in window medium player zippo happens the name doesnt even appear in the play list if i try to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i conceive that the problem is make by the lodge name path being too long window wont even let you rename them in the normal way update ive found a workaround to the lodge problem which is lean at the end of this review also several of the track are not relaxing imho for good example disc track violin sonata ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha several section that are quite loud and heavy handed and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for two piano begin quietly but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive disc track minuet in g ha a few section that are right down bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass voice contrast in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporiferous but the survival of the fittest on this duad of mp disc look to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring good example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a universal sampling station if you the like of but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it finished lodge repair solution a i surmise the problem is the undue length of the lodge name and path the total route that the computer take to get to the indian file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path document and setting all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe of discourse thats character right wing there which leaf character for the track name now let consider the name of one of the non functional indian file disc sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for two piano in f minor op b ii andante un poco adagio mp thats character so the total is character well over the character limit window just cant handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the indian file sail to the folder a lean above temporarily rename the folder something very short the like of xyz without the quotation mark thats character poor than the original lodge name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual indian file go through and chop out all the duplicate info in the good example minded above youll cut out character leaving a total of character do this for all the track finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something sensible the like of relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new lodge name from the good example above which is character youll see that you end up with a total of character well under the character limit of course one wonder why didnt amazon think about this and use a sensible album name and lodge name without duplication in the first place my conclusion minded that at least four of the track are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least instant sleep with around to fix the lodge naming error imho this collection just isnt worth the trouble even if it free to begin with of course if youre really hard up for music that is possibly relaxing go for it personally i think amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them
0	a nice album comprised of track which have already been published under the how the west wa swung series by wr record vol through very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best of compilation if you have bought the wr record series you do not necessarily need this album

0	i came of age during the s and s to this solar day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not dress up and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at to the lowest degree also cover yourself to the original
0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism the animal third album the first beeing the animal and the second animal track i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job ive heard so far the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track a complete failure repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try thank god i have the original on tape in stereo
1	love it
0	you would think that this is the exact same track from the paperman short but you would be wrong it missing the electric guitar that come in at during the actual video meaning it is meant to be award around the mark for the mp for me this omission ruin the entire track let down
1	there really is separate affair to consider in critique this birdcall first there is the medicine the birdcall is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of the birdcall the production is clean with all pawn clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the birdcall is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your make what really separate this is the lack of glamour in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can force back a musician to despair i retrieve that at the beginning of the birdcall it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid birdcall but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an precise view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and dependably but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it

0	this experience album is horrible the rest of comprise van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be put out to pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a helium crappy performance problem david lee roth think he david lee roth circa a such he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly he only sings half of the lyric the rest are spoken he add all kind of lame embellishment boater to the lyric he change up the tempo of the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a lot of stupid along stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward he us completely different lyric when a song break down quiet along think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is not good at blossom all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album wa released youll know what im talking about that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse ill sing it for boater you right this range comprise time in other word dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and ill wait which are the hold out main reason i bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with sung dynasty the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his helium prime do not buy this album unless punk you love disappointment
1	i passion this cd barbra is amazing
0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha honestly been one of the severely overexposed artist of the past and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frill from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning of the now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the is have they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive second the two of them do not ignite in heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pas this one up because four and five second feel more like wasted time overall song

0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on is terrible because it is not well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who seemed to sell million of record were in bad taste musically this cd take that to whole other level

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with alike seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but is it really entertainment when cosmos sound out we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so artistry jeanne telecasting robertson stress pas through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is trump a fibber very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the in truth forerunner to southerly book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the virago story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink army of the righteous at each other when something she say hit home to me southern storyteller are fibber the best because the art ha carried on longer and it clobber is still considered an art having lived all over the united state i know other region have great storyteller but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because expressive style for fibber so long so many folk lacked an education or a tv or radio and it wa necessary to tell story to keep smashing others entertained whatever the case it opine is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted inwards storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon you can now download it i would sound out strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain exploit to her fashion story of wearing delight a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing it let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for those of you who werent i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson

0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him overmaster producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him their review look seem a little medicine biased at best the truth jolly is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe then so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song youve pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous generic wine studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers listen it it too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it if operating theater you in truth dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to hither overwhelm get the real deal

1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast at least for me with seemingly everything entertaining news program comedy monologue tv show around u hop skip and jumping support from scene to scene or subject to subject so fast that it a miracle we all dont suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye but simply is it really cark it entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped up on caffeine just to keep up i dont think so jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing pine tree state that happen around her that humor is a very valuable smashing commodity that we need to to be on the look out for and enjoy on a daily basis storytelling is not something new in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate and while storytelling can be from one person to another it front is best shared with an associate in nursing audience so that more can enjoy the story and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story in southern style you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit piece home to me southern storyteller are the best because the art ha testify carried on longer and it is still considered an art having lived all over the inwards united state i know other region have great storyteller carolina but there is something about the south comprise that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy some may say it because for so long so many folk comprise lacked an education or a tv or radio and army of the righteous it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained whatever the comprise case it is a blessing testify that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and comprise gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson while all of m robertson cd are excellent southern style to me is the cream of the crop and through amazon iodin you can now download it i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good and they have a tendency to interweave from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband left brain field of study exploit to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina fancy wrap in new york in closing let me say i wa blessed associate in nursing to have have been raised in the south with it great storyteller but for those of you who werent i can think of comprise no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson

1	this album is amazing i have been a tough sell lately on new music especially on first listen throughs but i wa instantly strung out if you like zaba youll like this it different but in a good way
1	will put you in the mood
1	ive got to admit ive had this since it first come up out i am just writing a review now better late than never i give the is headliner yes it is a mellow but it is awesome just like paul john rowlands kiss solo my personal favorite wa the most mellow of the four his song i palpate were the stongest just like that his live to win may be mellow but the song the vocal and the playing is top notch paul is a master craftsman of song he always writes the best music then cast his songcrafting ability to it definatly a star this is paul stanley at his best rock on
0	the sound quality of this cd is awful slant imagine what it would be like if it hadnt been remasterd
0	not normally fan of remixes and in this case there is no exception if you have not the original onerepublic dreaming out loud that ha this song on it you are missing out i understand timbaland helped onerepublic started but there is no reason for taking credit for someone el song i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound mix of the song could have been left out i much prefer the original mix to this version

0	buyer beware this is only a sample of the track it is only a second clip non not worth
1	one of the most overlooked album in it respective in the last year
1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over then you know youve got a good album eisleys unique sound is so soothing refreshing and at the same time slightly rockin id say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard with girl vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony every song ha it moment of pure joy and satisfaction it just make you feel good simply put it just good listening good music for the ear

0	wow im really disappointed in this i guess im not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this the band sound muddled and uninspired i get the impression they are going through the motion which they are and could really care le anymore what they put out roth sound soooooo bad it really embarrassing and im still not excited about the set list it not it a bad set list but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore album worth of material a it never happened and virtually ignore the new material from very album are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh would of a new album they were proud of what they did and dying to show it off there are song on adkot that are begging to be played live but im guessing well never hear em shame to put this and not have cut like river and your blue or beat workn on here a terribly retreaded and unoriginal a adkot wa i still enjoyed the quiet a bit i play it often and it ha some great song to workout to to bad most of them will never see the light of day light what a shame ill pas i own about every vh cd thats been released had iii but got rid of it ill pas on this one ill still listen to the studio cut heck daves last solo wa pretty good but ill pas on the live money grab thank you very much

0	i swear this is a very good of bob dylan singing of christmas song it is isnt it please tell me it is
0	no this is not another ive been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c a good a she wa on car wheel true ive always liked in a world of boy band and pop music shes been a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent in borderland between country blue and rock her life hasnt always been easy which is reflected in her voice in her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it a double cd track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumble but thats not really the main she ha mumbled all the way to kiss when her voice wa still young and strong it ha never bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel ive heard all before in fact i pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and memory are copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong there even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a powerful rock ballad some review praise her sound which is stripped down and basic to me it flat uninterested and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music it the sound of old beer tired muscle and autumn rain it the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with job ha lucinda finally lost it have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had than enough song make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and in a world where good and original songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this however wa just a big yawn to me
0	this chick is ridiculous she sound like a britney spear on crack there is perfectly no talent on this bitch

0	i had pain in the neck no idea what they sounded like but once i downloaded this song i thought what a waste of time dont bother unless youre a fan im certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album it made a very poor impression then but i thought id go back and take another look some decade later this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired ray manzareks unique soulful creative keyboard rendition robby kriegers classical level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band what i expected from these guy particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity wa an impressive soul chilling outpouring of creative spirit robbie krieger after all wrote some of the door most popular piece and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian if not in ray vocal at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song this is what i expected what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul their lyric and melody sounded astonishingly mind blowingly banal lacking even the faintest trace of the rich subversive haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best even their song title practically scream low brow mediocrity im horny im stoned seriously listening to this album i cant believe anyone not knowing who these guy were would recognize anything doorsian about them despite appearance this review isnt about bashing the surviving member of the door they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man and still do to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude for me this is about solving a mystery how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity he may also have imposed a clearly much needed discipline by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric something about morrison i think drew out the best in krieger manzarek and densmore and perhaps morrison simply wouldnt accept anything but the best from his bandmates perhaps more than anything he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically a fertile world where their musicality could flourish i have little doubt that if you placed a young hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result i believe the post morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic a pretty face goosebump producing voice and even a songwriter he wa a primal creative force a dionysus to his bandmate maenad with him they were a holy orgiastic force without him they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest

0	i like to pick out song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program i cant find here when i think i like what im hearing they find a way to blow the deal almost every song is overplayed talented guitar but little feel for restraint and which sends most song off the recalculating weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd they can surely play but need some serious direction will jennings greatest for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid these guy could use his help and get a singer could end up being somebody

1	how could you go wrong with live zepp at hold out any price
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and artist from the late s would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i to see expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the he and his engineer could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	i became a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work ive tried to find other recording by okko that might be in style so far ive had only moderate hybrid fart that name should have been first clue if were even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german im not so sure it even okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa by the sound emanating from my speaker that i didnt look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class that so if you are looking like me for something along the of his sitar electronics cd which is a true then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction the music struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like end of day rough mix until you i can a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient far a i know there are release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar s e please leave me the information in a comment to my review

0	the book think grow rich is a must own it is book to be read multiple time being said the particular reader of this book very monotone doesnt pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second the narrator ha a strong voice it just emotionless it reminded me when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming bottomline buy the book buy the audio book just skip this one

1	this is a strange a externalise a i can imagine purportedly dock dylan or his minder find a flock of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and kinda than composing borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling nose drop revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although helium been take a shit his own record since the s kinda he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early on costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing laboratory inviting collaboration and take a shit no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in legion genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the externalise my best guess is that he had some authority he could finish the title skip which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different way most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket ace all his appointment and still sound a deal out like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of william dawes is the odd comprehension here because helium a very understated singer equate to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape style the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will upshot in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year

0	did not dictate this item
0	there seems to mind be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the comprise rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give delight to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory iodin i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved inwards groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to delight it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in tush you may enjoy it but i idea hunger all over would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin thing mind so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice pious platitude of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of woefully changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen deepness to often however i dont feel that he done that and yet reexamination at the same time i think he charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album person even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some coherency of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london and then hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed gouge economic consumption with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the comprise lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often wishing written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of train answer the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow posse a an artist and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own it boundary but i ampere wish i would word have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging individual it way over the atlantic sadly it staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone comprise that im probably not that close inwards to edited to pertain add i have noticed some commenting ampere regarding what i said about fan creative person posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to instead the album my comment came a a result of a thread on information technology his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards explain him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed novel at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what accept they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many information technology fan and a such it could have an impact on former armed force here i think it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves

0	it is uncommon to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his track use your back yard a a toilet molly jean wa when this wa recorded it wa produced by a member of the volebeats which enticed me to buy it it is uncommon to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch occasionally flat frequently sharp but only about of the time doe she actually fall close to hitting a note level when she writes the song this music is like the first american language idol show of the season where simon laugh at how bad you are and find comic insult oxycontin denim whore is one of molly original song not only is she a very poor singer she also is not much of a songwriter she doe a cover of a song yell needle in a haystack that i believe wa done by a motown band yell the velvelettes it ha a nice bass line which is the nicest matter i can find to say about this cd if you had a hombre with their tail in the vacuum uninfected you power get an idea of the sound this is an independent release molly jean ha made her cd for reason out now clear to me very few have bought it this is one to avoid at all cost unless you are of a contrary musical nature that delight in the banal i havent found a cd this dreadful since ramblin jack eliotts nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href the long ride dp b jzau ref cm cr arp rvw txt internet explorer utf the long ride a and this is actually worse than that molly jean is pretty loretta young girl im sure shell find something she can do well taxi
1	fuck it jill at her best
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong even those who were swayed by her honest to heel girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song with each outshining the last one swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she up with her best to date album speak now which like fearless is laced with girl wisdom that anyone can nod his her head to but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel her latest album boldly named red is an abysmal effort best creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble pop princess pop with an attitude and horrendously little girly lyric those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed swift ha not grown her th album but shrank or more explicitly aging her song are now for year old girl or younger and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting together the title of the song is bad enough but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt after all one of the song on her last deluxe album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful heart felt song and one of my favorite her this time however ha out it wa worse than i couldve ever imagined how bad well let just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday but unlike rebecca black she can not plead lack of experience or young age is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk at one point she even croons i say i hate you we break up you call me love you an of the song can be thus oh so i told you the other day i called him up and he wa like can we make up and i wa like no way and he wa like please and we ended up in like restaurant and then he said something that i didnt like so i wa like we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again and he wa like whaaaat and i wa like yep i have no doubt that song ha the potential to sell very well after all just how many time can one over the american audience anyways phrasing of most of rest her song are the worst ive heard of taylor swift so far the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re e e e e d and e e e e e that went along chick self victimizing lyric that unlike the last couple of album lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain thus they no longer charming but ego centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader while any song on red that actually sound tad bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back december worse move wa to invite other male singer to collaborate song with her normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally but now with other singer the difference is painfully acknowledged especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of lightbody essentially owned the song out reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing along audience in the there ha always been argument of swift genre whether she can be considered country or just pop and it didnt matter because she wa good at what she doe but now with this album who can really say that shes still country her album isnt even good pop perhaps she should think twice before a bunch of writer for bubble gum pop and return to do everything by herself or work better musician best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing and they are justified in their skepticism she is clearly not on that level yet a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe she should slow down and take a good look around her being centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while but much of something is rarely a good thing because the truth of matter is the world is composed of much bigger thing than her
0	the tune wa a repeat of past have fun teaching song and too advance for my year old i purchase am able to a adjust most of three other song i have purchased adapt the other song like water cycle were great

0	it always good to hear an artist alteration and try new thing back in when jewel did it wa a big deal everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair this disc while different is just not what i would call jewel at her best i determine america somewhat enjoyable and guide u wa also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me i did give her a second chance and recently grease one palm her cd goodbye and i must say it jewel slowly regaining her musicality also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next it will fit her voice well
1	thanks for getting it me on time and a described got ta love doing this dance
1	ive it written that great art divide and that is the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a rock opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
0	what is it with this guy will he ever have the gut release another album without a greatest hit package tagged onto this new material this guy for year ha re released the same old music the one time he didnt with a million budget sold million copy the usa though his million budget wa directed to only marketing in the usa why doesnt everyone go to cnet com go to the downloads section get yourself a free mp cd ripper then get jackson first solo album or really any of his album make copy of them then burn your own cd of your own personal choice of song that in a nutshell is what michael jackson ha done for year he know his new stuff cant stand on it own so then we need greatest hit package tagged on or just release box set number one etc etc i never seen another guy live off his past more then him word to the wise get yourself a free mp cd ripper rip your already owned old material and make your own cd with different selection because that is all is doing
0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented in many different aspect he wa creative and every time i listened to his other show i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field this album is not creative nor funny just hateful mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop fireman and snitch are a well a fart and enema joke go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy because will not find it here

0	and this year crud fest winner the person who received the most vote from every brain dead glossy eyed plankton watching who even care anymore yet another drone pulled off the production line this gimp being another in the long run of inoffensive handsome white boy aimed primarily at stupid people and judging by the popularity of this single there are an awful awful lot of so let talk about the single with the exception of the excrement that wa last year winner steve brookstein currently missing in action yet another one hit wonder who well never see again first and only solo the dire phil collins cover this is easily the worst actual attempt at a song planned for westlife thats my goal wa panned and rejected by them them westlife for being too weak but sure wasnt weak for shayne ward currently number one for the fourth week running a i type this but what that mean exactly ill tell you nothing the general public are such idiot such pathetic tell u what to buy and we will easily led cretin that would buy anything after seeing it on a reality program shayne ward could have released a record of him whistling the marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one and it going to continue isnt it wa a massive hit the show wa a massive hit so were going to to be bombarded with bland generic singer and pointless like this you bought this junk or if you watched this junk the curmudgeon hold you personally responsible you should be ashamed of yourself for bringing down to the gutter mass watching this easily digestible pond life program and buying it cynical disgusting product one day i hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television where tv schedule and budget are not ruled by program aimed at the great unwashed where the chart are not in the vice like grasp dire tv talent show winner and loser that lady and gentleman that is my goal the curmudgeon hate you yahoo co uk

0	only good sung dynasty
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this album isnt for you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices s album the others being flush the fashion and special force all three while they dont match most of his s album deliver the hard rock good while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
0	pretentious bombastic eer and utterly devoid of charm this is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge this is truly one of the worst album ive ever heard

1	excellent recording i can not stop listening to this once angstrom i bought this i got all the other master in this series a well
1	this concept and music dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever the music is phenominal who would have expected le and the live acoustic and cd dvd package is an off the chart idea in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver lid off to shinedown for advent through in a major way
1	i had typed a review for another song jump shout boogie medley and that review wa for both that song and this song since i iodin purchased both song at the same time for the same reason

1	yes it it a great song
1	anything that rattling patti labelle sings cant be bad i loved this song when she and michael mcdonald first recorded it on separate coast and i still love it wonderful album maryg
0	it bother me that the list last in melodic line is used here i retrieve seeing an interview of the newest at the time leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos sure we are entitled to forgiveness but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory after rjd ha passed no lupus erythematosus onto the music the vocal are merely equal and border on generic nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire he cue of a better protester on american idol vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound just doesnt have any punch everything else is just by the number for a band that ha call for such an amazing album and title a it list sake they just dont eventide begin to break new ground do nothing special with it and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band what a joke
1	i like the rythm
0	buy accidentally
0	i thought karaoke lyric came with the music id buy more if i knew the lyric came with it a in other karoake angstrom music
0	i liked this song until i watched the video come on then robin thicke got twerked on by miley ugh while his wife played it cool for a while eventually she left him and finally say he ha addiction issue am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where the singer actor personal life interferes with opinion of the actual song movie see anything by amy winehouse all thing brad pitt gwyneth paltrow or rihanna
0	care if it your birthday or not the song is awful she need to be banned from radio completely hide your wallet so you can make her go away

1	i absolutely love this singer artist she ha quite a voice vocalization and she delivers in every song she sings enjoy
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time derive i heard it and it still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance represent but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song thats what this song totally ride on at least chris brown even though it a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better lyric nice video altogether i just dont iodin appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable b complex beat alike off though come on we heard it nix enough in second i will never forget you youre in everything i do later just like a tattoo ill always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe youll get some attention star end note beautiful also voice but get a new producer who isnt afraid to try something new and comprise different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g also but copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and take account nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal comprise work stand out
0	i never ordered this
0	i am a vocal man so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the merriment line she lost sight of fun music why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean during my era of music it wa pretty simple journey lovin touchin squeezin pretty simple huh def ampere leppard pour some sugar on me no college class to figure out what any of those song accept were about forever and i guess it is a necessity speculation to have explicit language on every album now
1	like this song a i know it wa meant for his father tug mcgraw it is a great song and tim doe a good job singing it but i am not a fan of tims
1	i just watched the blu ray of the movie woodstock it ha the csn y version at the end of the movie but jm get a separate credit for writing the song
1	it weird and kinda creepy but i love it
0	perv
1	im jockin on these hater man this song is a euphoric mix of culture party five star
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late s would have have submitted to company a a demo i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i fail to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	for one it wa the myopic verision or radio version also they gave the impression that it wa un edited but it wa not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning mark for content they should also put a warning mark for edited content
0	this song becomes sung dynasty more and more depressing a time go along so i deleted it
1	squeamish change for adam
1	i havent heard anything of his since the crossover that i didnt like i can listen to him all day

1	if nothing else i recommend light by battleme great haunting song that replay in my head over and over i can even see the image of jax following juice in his truck a this song is being played
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well worth owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection
1	the cd got to pr in no time it wa in condition and it wa overall perfect since i love manson and his new album
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste in effect summary buy of simply find it on you tube
0	so i know there are two dirty word in the song and i wanted the clean version that you hear on the radio so i could listen to it even if my child pop into the room but instead of using another word like the radio edit this one us cartoon effect very weird and just a you are getting into the song that pop up wish i wouldnt have bought this one

0	this artist leaf a lot to be desired i actually tried to listen to a trivial bit of this and and keep an open mind but i found myself not being able to get by the first thirty second it is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly pass for music today save your money or get it on bootleg personally i wouldnt take this for free add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thief cop orcinus orca drug addict and ex con not the kind of person for me natali if youre reading this i hope you make some beneficial pick in the future

0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety and the orchestral arrangement are of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long but still neither is enough to let me sit through song of depression pining cry in your liner note you wrote of you trying not make this album too one note but your failed unless you are someone put a gun to their or go jump in the river i can not recommend this even a background dinner music bring back the happy swingin cool seth please
1	one of the upper side christmas single ever
0	this cd wa terrible and not just because he is using other artist music and seemingly getting away with breaking the law for now being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon it is terrible because it is not well done the transition are terrible most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song where is the theme it is closer to a second clip sample on random shuffle i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne souljah boy justin beiber or any name from a slew of non talented performer who seemed to sell million of record were in bad taste musically this cd take that to a whole other level

0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so assay much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but sung dynasty ha an attractive front and innocent face i accidently got away stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters

1	one of the best compilation great way to meet and learn about yes when most people think of rock music the general conception is of boisterous noisy unruly dope then like pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication these tune are not only enjoyable they also nurture one synphonic appreciation thus and roll grew up to become plain rock which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece

0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frill from marrying kim kardashian to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the year now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the question is have they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly on only one now with fourfive second the two of them do not ignite in the heart instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pas this one up because four and five second feel more like wasted time overall song f

0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar electronics work ive tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style so far ive had only moderate success hybrid fart that name should have been my first clue if were even talking about a bekker cd everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant not really the language of love is it or perhaps not so wordy for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german im not so sure it even an okko bekker recording i couldnt find his name anywhere on the cd package granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i didnt look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart i think mr bekker ha a bit more class than that so if you are looking like me for something along the line of his sitar electronics cd which is a true gem then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction the music struck me a st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud sort of like the end of day rough mix until you or i can find a good successor to sitar electronics let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer a far a i know there are release by each band all record are a magnificent journey on their own if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s e please please leave me the information in a comment to my review
0	i received a discount on this product for my honest feedback good ampere item
1	great song
0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking taste forward to his solo debut unfortunately true accept tonne confession fell short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt producer me to buy the album after getting the cassingle anyone else remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c elli had a manufacturer fast paced flowing sung dynasty rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow unskilled choppy style on most of true confession it possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and metre cold thang however even with decent sample and beat the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap tonne on graffiti bridge sec and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the album however
0	csn deja vu after the gold rush these were the album that helped to define an era for some of u csn operating theater never supassed that first album either collectively or individually though they did have some good song on some album neil young roughly wa able to transcend the era that is why he still is a vital recording artist nostalgia make me all the same sad i dont need it
1	i love this album favorite include anthem run outlaw scared chasing twister and my whole life long after it all make me weep with joy if youve never seen them live dont omit the chance anyone can sound decorous in the studio with a thousand take few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live
0	cant say that there is record album anything particularly memorable on this cd i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
1	i like these rib they kind of blur the line between pop and rock but somehow still come off a being heavy they just kind of have a nice old school feel good rock vibe
1	an excellent song and prayer for every believer help me to comprise keep my focus on my heavenly celestial hope i think most of u long for our heavenly home and to be with our loved one that have gone before u
1	i always have first heard it when it came out this time i bought it s a gift for someone iodin else
0	this soundtrack left off the only song i enjoyed from the movie i guess i should have read the song list
1	attention getting i hated their voice at first and i hated the lyric but i listened to the whole thing twice and it actually is kinda catchy but then everyone is different for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it really just depends on how the music ring inside your ear
0	when i purchased act on this product it would not download i could get no help from amazon it wasnt worth pursuing it for cent
1	trump the majestic song dead or alive open bait this album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides jim goodwin peter muny robert medici alone worth the price of the album this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and phantasmagorical is driven by the shimmering trumpet line of john normality gatchell a live version with a significantly different feel appears on nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href come alive dp b ijz ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf come alive a fighter pilot is another frenzied track where the bomberettes provide frisky background vocal assume whilst cales comprise voice viola rule on the multi layered wilson joliet eerie gothic street of laredo is a slow brooding piece with strange percussive internet explorer sound effect that wouldnt seem out of place in the work of edgar varese equally downtempo strange time in casablanca ha surrealistic lyric and a psychedelic texture the highly experimental title track is a ampere strange atonal affair dominated by the french chant of honi consequence soit qui mal y pense record album stab of high pitched backing vocal and the weird wailing of dissonant synths guitar normality return with tug the chromium mournful melodious riverbank that reach a crescendo before fading out on enchanting instrumentation it recall the gentler side of nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link unlike normal href wrong way up dp b lnb ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf wrong way up a cales collaboration with brian eno russian roulette rock hard in whole kit the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href slow dazzle dp b n n ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf slow dazzle a nbsp manner and the album concludes with magic lie a striking blend of classical and rock that expires on the last gasp of shuddering drum pattern honi soit is an consequence uneven album and not amongst cales most accessible
1	great metal song
0	wow im really disappointed in this i guess im just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this but the band sound muddled and unimaginative i get the impression they are going through the motion which they are and could really care le anymore what they put out roth sound soooooo spoilt it really embarrassing and im hush up not excited about the set list it not that it a spoilt set list but they have become a protection band to themselves considering they choose to ignore album worth of material a if it never happened and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting so disappointing back in the day vh would play of a new album they were majestic of what they did and die to show it off there are song on adkot that are just begging to be played live but im guessing wellspring never hear em shame to put this out and not have cut like big river you and your blue or beat workn on here a terribly remould and unoriginal a adkot wa i hush up enjoyed the release quiet a bit i play it often and it ha some great song to workout to to spoilt most of them will never see the light of day light what a shame sick pas i own about every vh cd thats been put out had iii but experience rid of it but sick pas on this one sick hush up listen to the studio apartment cut heck daves last solo wa pretty good but sick pas on the live money grab give thanks you very much
1	i information technology like it just what we expected
1	okay after using that annoying pun inwards allow me to elaborate a little constitute bit lee greenwood is one render hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first small scale album of his ive bought and no in clutch case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt thing though ill get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter good sense thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these corrupt song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into english hawthorn something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look comprise at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you cant use move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever astatine comprise lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched angstrom aside grasp from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem comprise it may not be stronger than time but it definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time
0	this is another case where le is more i found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i wa caught in a deluge

0	i bought this for my month old and she is not impressed by it at all she much rather listens to the radio guess i could have saved the money
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in same breath pure insult his vocal are poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and this one not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
0	should have been edited version it seemed what i wa purchasing expectant artist loved blurred line without the ugliness make sure purchaser know what there buying i gave it away
1	in effect good

0	i wa very excited ampere to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i male erecticle dysfunction m the biggest fun once the cd arrived i put it on and i wa extremely disappointed very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin
1	dear it
0	making memory of mp could be imported the selected file is not valid or is corrupted this is my error message so the file is no good to me
1	another solid release this fit in well with the rest of the music ty ha put out over the year
0	this is a waste of money i got a cd with no book and no talk on cd they sell something new now which is the same old thing with new cover very disappointing sorry ed sueta
1	nice mellow song about reminiscing about day gone by what could have been if comprise feeling between two people had been in sync
0	it unfortunate that there isnt a negative rating scale the disc took five week to arrive both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging recycled the day it arrived
0	this recent purchase wa resold for a couple dollar it virtually all noise the vocal by mick jagger are ragged and imo there not a couple up single good song among the lot
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever get a line a must for those who collect this type music
0	sound quality is raceway poor probably original it would be better if the track had been remastered at least you get to hear the way the music sounded by the original band at the time they were produced
0	range this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp it is the live version from the chuck berry film hail hail hold out rock n roll it misleading to label it re mastered when it is a different version from the original
0	the simply only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song i wa expecting the song like in the iodin opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens voice started comprise chiming in i dont recall that from the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but i cant recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this disco music cd i should have demoed the song before ordering but i do like the disco song that are not available for download
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one very short a little over a minute buyer should be notified have never seen such a short rendition and be charged more like a sample
1	this wa one of my favorite song pet from the s i have been putting together a playlist of all my favorite s song and this one had to be included
0	misleading name the name of this song should be changed putting basement tape on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version a real disappointment when looking for the popular version
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago kind of like the miami dolphin i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl same here with chicago s and s with their intense musical and political statement and then s and s mega wimpy commercial hit chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the s and s such a shame it is also sad they sold out once again i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance in many interview during their year musical hiatus robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek i also think that wea now and former label had creative control for this project well i am certain they will get some hit from this minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel degree already gone better if there wa no champlin i would give it star since champlin wa coerced to do this cd i give it star for bill voice and songwriting talent the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago ooops i wont hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song too bad
0	the cd stalled halfway through the first song not satisfied
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when volition she first released this wrong album i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail initiative oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of male child using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras boozer father wa really wassail something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the unlike accept song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known support where he wa no incident like that is range found anywhere in the entire disappoint little house series if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like the set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le regardless of their history ive always been a big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded of the way the rascal got away from their creative like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix track like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to from dreaded sound the same disease the combination latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live but in studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in the positive column this wa the album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song wa a mess a forgettable melody vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually out sounding good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo but it also sort of soulless star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ear it basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman didnt help sale all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you kaz side magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

1	i decided to buy this military policeman download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare he an interesting person with a unique soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint this ha been one of the best album that ive ever purchased to date every song is different but exceptional too especially work force are clever hummingbird us a heart beat alike base for the rhythm of the song and partner off this beat with a pop alike upbeat chorus whereas up all night is a rock hymn to evening natural action there something no this album cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed i promise
1	excellent product and service
1	you know im just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the from original to remastered but i will say paying or for this seven albulm is tremendous i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fan i became aware during the in the tour then purchased all the previous cassette so in the last year cassette lost and became obsolete now i able to purchase all seven what amount to each thats a win right there and like a number of people i find the first seven springsteen to be the sans a couple of live album so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with
0	i should have just bought the song that i liked the song on the radio are the only one that worth a s the rest of the suck which wa quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry i would recommend to only buy the song they like and leave rest
1	i begin love anything royalty free this album ha everything in sec sec and full track these track range from movie track to high energy rock with this album you get over track i will use this medicine high quality music and in my independent film project
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if you like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein
1	great smashing song
0	gape i yawned i actually yawned
1	fun birdcall
0	wow another album from brmc where they can not decide what kind of music they want to make rocker or slow drawn out and imo dull folk song i really liked war machine aya those i bought and enjoyed ill be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again

0	this is horrible rest of van halen are doing a terrific job but david lee roth should be out pasture i cant believe they would put their name on such a performance david lee roth think he david lee roth a such he feel free to take liberty and song incorrectly he only sings half of the lyric the rest are spoken he add kind of lame embellishment to the lyric he change up the tempo the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly i e not singing he say a lot of stupid stuff to the during the song that are just awkward he us completely different lyric when a song break down quiet think hot for teacher panama mean streats etc while they made him sound good in the studio david voice live is not good at all he can barely sing if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this wa released youll know what im talking about that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that ive ever heard flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse ill sing it for you right this time in other dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and ill wait which are the main reason bought the album horrible horrible and horrible what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punk at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime buy this album unless you love disappointment
1	sung dynasty great song
1	this is a great session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a fine clollection of bebop ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant eddie mcfadden on guitar and stone donald bailey on roughly drum from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha cha romance this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat once again great rare music like this is only available a an bop import although now you crosswise can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen classic album which i purchased for about im so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic information technology session of jazz available affordable for those who like timeless music such a this one by jos papa lou who still today blow circle around ian douglas smith those much younger more acclaimed by the critic expert than he
0	i just cease downloading from the befog and there a problem four of the rail will not play on window medium player or on winamp on a window xp system the badness rail are disc track disc track disc track disc track if i effort to open them in window medium player nil happen the name doesnt even appear in the playlist if i effort to open them in winamp then disc track canon play instead i believe that the problem is caused by the file name path being too longsighted window habit even let you rename them in the normal way update ive incur a workaround to the file problem which is listed at the end of this look back also respective of the rail are not relaxing imho for example disc track violin sonata ha respective passage that become quite loud and full of angst not relaxing to me disc track ballade no ha respective section that are quite loud and heavy turn over and a section near the end that is quite agitated disc track sonata for ii pianissimo begin quietly but ha respective passage that become quite loud and belligerent disc track minuet in thou ha a few section that are downright bombastic with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play very loudly indeed classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific but the selection on this geminate of mp disc seems to be quite erratic to point out just one glaring example where is brahms lullabye buy this a a cosmopolitan sampler if you like but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it cease file repair solution a i mistrust the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path the entire route that the computing device take to get to the file window allows a maximum of character for the path name by default when you download these amazon will put them in this path c document and context all user document amazon various artist a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe thats character right there which leaf character for the track name now let consider the name of one of the non functional file disc sonata for ii pianissimo in farad minor op b ii andante un poco adagio sonata for ii pianissimo in farad minor op b ii andante un poco adagio mp thats character so the total is character well over the character fix window just cant handle that a a workaround after you have downloaded all the file navigate to the folder a listed above temporarily rename the folder something very short change like xyz without the quotation mark thats character shorter than the original file name now the total are under character so window will let you rename the individual file go through and chop out all the duplicate information in the example given above youll track out character leaving a total of character do this for all the rail finally if you want you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of character if you add the new file name from the example above which is character youll see that you end up with a total of character well under the character fix of of course one question why didnt amazon recollect about this and use a reasonable record album name and file name without duplication in the first lay my conclusion given that at least four of the rail are not relaxing and youll have to spend at least minute screwing around to fix the file naming error imho this collection just isnt worth the disoblige even if it free to begin with of of course if youre really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing go for it personally i recollect amazon could and should do a better job i know i would if i worked for them
0	i recollect liking this song when it wa popular yr ago really stupefied at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era and since am i the only unmatched that think she absolutely can not stay in tune she flat out every few bar she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and honestly the quality of her voice is at best very average overall kind of meh

1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable of the classic song it beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful the original santa ive been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation

0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting this type of garbage i cant not help but laugh at how bad song is when i hear it sound like something that an year old should be singing not someone nearly i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doesnt compare to his first album
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection even if you like sinatra youll be disappointed in dylan interpretation if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it very dismal not even good for elevator music
0	this guy is terrific however this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the in content every song on one is on the other in the exact order and i bought both thinking theyd be different really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title great performer probably a decent guy but let take one of those off the market it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky
0	i generally like starbombs music for what it is and what it is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist havent deviated from their theme however compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make reference to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game review on youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise
0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative register opinion rendered bob unequal dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the accept only song on this entire cd that work is get a line information technology must be santa which should have been released a a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show forthwith have become incoherent because of comprise his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come associate in nursing for bob turned dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung operating theater on too long like a washed up prize water washed fighter
0	im very frustrated i thought this wa posted be a regular size of it cd i had no idea this wa a mini cd and i dont have a mini cd player at all so i couldnt evening use this im very frustrated on my purchase them to keep u posted on line i had the right to if i give it a one star paygrade i thought this wa post be a regular size of it cd i waste my money nobody should not buy this because youre gon na be frustrated when you receive it

0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol i had heard this song the radio probably too much and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today i to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now given the whole chris brown thing it me feel disgusted about in general but really this song is a sappy love song and ending is nothing but them shouting out random and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long i know you can both sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal a lot of people just not me just my opinion
1	two icon making great music together
0	a lot of people have praised this disc but im not one of them this recording is many thing but the soundtrack it is not despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of platter song also written by him this disc ha the song that appeared in the film but not one note of the score despicable is the word for this disc because it only delivers a small praise sample of the film background inwards music and the score is a significant element in any film without the score all this disc doe is deliver background knowledge the icing on the cake without the cake if like me you enjoy film score then pic this disc is one you should skip

0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential but he ruined what been a beautiful song by trying to sing high that beyond his range he sounded screechy the track wa also somewhat misleading because it me to a slow tender seduction song not a sad one i do think peter could do really well if he learned to within his vocal range and select better material to sing
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song dated late eighty early ninety production hasnt dated too well this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and cole were at district attorney top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a senior high top fade like will smith and arsenio

0	let me break this down in a rather incomplex fashion for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just meter reading the review to gripe and moan nirvana while rebellious offered zero freshly or even creative to the melodic landscape of this or any other era i understand and even empathize with all the rack soul out there but cobain didnt talk to you in fact he loathed you a he did all of his loyal rooter thats the catch twenty two with an anti everything group such a nirvana in following them you are actually defying all that they stand or abide for and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic present day or true fan in fact by worshipping nirvana you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to ruin learn this and accept it secondly the music please stop pleading otherwise wa diluted sickly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty his lyric were not poetic or abstract or other wordly they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist i a well severely shouldnt need to yell any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar let simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than perfunctory in addition the rest of the band member were a well hardly virtuoso so you can cease in claiming that a well thirdly an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere the longevity of an album inspect this postulate it show in what we now consider to be classic is a well completely dependent on the diversity of sound and stylus which the album employ time ha repeatedly shown this and needle to say nevermind and all other nirvana album for that matter are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan thats three strike nirvana rooter yep so ill leave you with a sagacious word advice if you will regarding a better melodic path which it isnt too late to pursue for the love of god if one live heed my yell the world will experience a sound change for the better if you do if you are planning on picking up or wreak or praising a nirvana cd and are doing so because you despise order and all that the archetypal american language stand for then you should listen to these album instead the velvet underground the vu and nico or white light white heat the mother of invention freak out or were only in it for the money the fug the fug elliott smith elliot smith or xo radiohead amnesiac kid a ok computer the bend or hail to the thief you have a mild aversion to consumerism and or love poignant dear lyric then

0	it pain me to see so many star review coming from dylan own fan base i have been a fan for over year and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now but that hasnt stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa which should have been released a a limited edition x ma single for this charitable cause his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice he change all the arrangement of his song during live show because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded there come a time in everyones life when it is time to get off the stage whether you are a doctor heavy equipment operator or in this case an musician i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter

1	i lost my cd of the manhattan rack up so i picked up my hit here great love song
0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert audience are often ill behaved and unforeseeable issue come into play that affect the performance of the day no artist ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a that wa the artist last word on the music this is grossly unfair and rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the under review is one such moreover it competes head on with recording of the same force in the studio and it come off the better schubert no or or depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue it ha several defect sound is boxy and painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml engineer were on to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspect played to the audience instead of microphone moreover he cut the repeat down suddenly the whole architecture of work make sense event played out inside of the acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts is not sacrificed academic criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording the question in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that question implicitly the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the vicinity of karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the recording move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of is lacking p album you at moment is the studio recording
0	there are lot of four or five star review that if you get over the drastic change in instrumentation this album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass band switched to trombone tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instrument they dropped the authentic folk real sounding instrument keep in mind i hate hipster and went with what can only be described a a fake electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok yes if this wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar absolutely not you can defend this disappointing to change their signature sound all you want but the fact is that all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool u did from joshua tree baby but like i said before this is like going from joshua tree pop they should have learned from u

0	i most of the review here are from people know danny or listen to him producing an talk show and have a certain affinity for him their review seem a little biased at best the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music it doe so in the most generic way possible nothing here is really worth listening to more than once and really once youve gotten to the chorus of each song pretty much heard all of it no fresh or exciting take here just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern dannys voice doesnt help matter much it not strong enough to be a so the generic music really overpowers it too bad actually if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a basic generic old country music album a such it fall short of even that if you know of danny and want to get this for reason then by all mean go for it if you dont know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you all others would be better served looking up marty robbins george jones or hank williams to get the real deal

1	i love illustriousness don meons music but there are a few song that will not play my favorite are ill say yes and the greatness of you
0	i thought this wa sung my dottie rambo didnt like it since elevated it wasnt i wa after hers not someone el
0	thie album is pretty good redneck crazy is by far the best song i would not buy music from amazon again have to use their player to down load and it is crap have to pa a year to add your track to it if you have over
0	making memory of usa mp could not be imported the selected file is not valid or is corrupted this is my error message so the file is no good to me
0	excellent presentation but it the worst floyd album ever they should ruefulness to had produced it
0	i dont normally give a poor review im more likely to lean toward average or better the product is fine play well no issue at all the problem i have is that i didnt get it for over hour i think today you should iodin be able to purchase a song on operating theater line and be minute able to play it then and there i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got nowadays tired of waiting i wont buy music from amazon anymore but ill still buy everything else
1	like most people i only buy song ive citizenry already heard and liked so yeah i think it is good
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes and is the best ive ever heard him do on his own railroad earth piece new grass jamband provides great support giving all these song out of which are haynes original an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel like fitting on that complete iron heel that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail i enjoyed the all of platter even though haynes song writing itself is only so so and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter platter arent bad although none of them seem essential in fact i thought the final live track weak and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation so perhaps a single platter edition would be all right for most fan overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar act a especially slide from haynes an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied pallette
1	my year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable channel music station it now a frequent player he here dozen of song a twenty four hour but this one wa a sticky one
0	actually to say i dont like it fair to middling is not totally accurate it is more than just tolerable but i guess i wa expecting something more than i got
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback robin idea thicke pharrell and t i definitly hit the nail on the head with one it reminded me of train something youd hear from earth wind and fire i hope these three collaborate again
1	great soulful delivery on every vocal included in this project
0	this is only relevant for the vinyl sung dynasty version this is about the piece of plastic itself not the music im a very big panic fan once i saw brendon tweeted in effect about this i preordered information technology it i received it on the day of the release april all good only today iodin i got to listen to it it all just a tiny bit too high pitched playing it in sync next to a digital version of the same song you can hear it and even adaptation without first time i played it and simply i swear i watched this thing like a hawk and cared for it like it wa my child there a lot of jumping in victorious and dont threaten me with a good time
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound the music here is strong throughout the cd and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it pretty simple if you are a big fan of the movie youll highly enjoy this sound track if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie youll also like this soundtrack strongly recommended
1	for most of u who are familiar with bob baldwin body of work the latest release all in a day work is simply brilliant the opening song a new york minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic baldwin if you have bobbaldwin com try playing funkin for jamaica and then can you feel it from the latest release both are vocalized by tonni smith for anyone in doubt delight you are invited to go bet on and give brazil chill another heed youll be beaming you did thats all i have to say brazil chill is just a brilliant a the others i am building up my collection of baldwin candle until have a many a i can get if youve never seen bob baldwin perform this is the frosting on the cake i can attest to that he is a true professional a skilled artist and band leader and fantastic performing artist

1	product delivered a described ship time wa expected
0	im big van halen fan but this live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk solo career he no seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the blame around it been a long time since i any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sound like an shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it it just atrocious everything is just muddled and blurry sounding im aware live is live but what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio im really surprised the band put stamp of approval on this recording a bad a result think it may been way better with decent mixing after rumor of a new baring no fruit i think this just slapped together with little effort just to get something out there sloppy effort by all involved im still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this aint gon na cut it sorry
1	praise god another sweet jam from lecrae

0	i been a fan of buffy and james marsters for year but wa not thrilled with this at all the music wa boring and not a exciting a his singing spot on buffy id pas on this one
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this some other song in truth first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal angstrom exactly where is should be comprise the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric instrumentalist bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can route drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the information technology unlike song it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a mention closer listen you can hear the effect that road life beware ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road begin can do to you bringing inwards to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
0	cant determine if music downloaded cant find where it downloaded or to what file wont download from amazon music again due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	great sound a i remember it
0	great music obviously but awful remastering even worse than the cd chrome box sound thin and tinny like it coming out of a transistor radio the mighty chrome deserve better but theyll never get it a long a theyre on cleopatra

1	i just discovered rosi golan o favorable me she sings song dynasty of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare such longing so beautifully expressed sinless she us the minor fashion in a way that express this longing and this innocence dead with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything that it must be real and true love and that such love doe exist all the song dynasty are wonderful but i especially recommend come around think of me and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart of real love thank you rosi
0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out year old mobile fidelity vinyl radical copy of from the mar hotel and have to say that while im a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp my old mobile fidelity japan campaign year old copy sound much more natural and is superior in almost every way in fact i panicked and bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful marketer a few day later earlier last year mofi wa supposed to re expel this album on lp but distinct not to at the last hour and friday music picked up the licensing right rather this reissue isnt all bad though a i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and ample passim the recording and the lp is indeed a very calm pressing at gram it wa campaign at rti in california and very good quality control standard were obviously taken by the staff that produced this recording

1	if nothing else i highly recommend light by battleme great haunting song that replay in my head over and over i can even see the image of jax following juice in his truck a this song is being played
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it still sugar coated fluff i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my nerve first copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song thats what this song totally ride on at least chris brown even though it a similar beat ha something going for his song with you better lyric nice video altogether i just dont appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in second i will never forget you youre in everything i do later just like a tattoo ill always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe youll get some attention star end note beautiful voice but get a new producer who isnt afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g but copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do the lyric are trite and super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work stand out
0	im not normally a fan of remixes and in this case there is no elision if you have not bought the original onerepublic album stargaze out loud that ha this song on it you are missing out i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started but there is no reason for taking quotation for someone el song i feel that timbalands donation to the sound mix of the song could easily have been left out i much prefer the original mix to this version

0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son in law a a joke because it is all the star review crack me up especially the one from the holier than thou hard core dylan fan particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just dont get it lolololol the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself the star review are so serious unbelievable same thing on itunes if you want some great entertainment read the review there for both camp hilarious i dont care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur youve got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop it is horrible in the worse way more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard even it is so horrible it is so entertaining im going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student a well a non musical friend i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him oh man im listening to this a i type it hurt my throat so much just listening to him a one die hard fan said this will indeed become a landmark album much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is thank you bob dylan for this wonderful christmas present we will listen to it or a portion of it every christmas just for a tear producing laugh it is a good thing that christmas is in his heart because it definitely aint in his voice

1	ill make this brief a usual tha animatrix dvd is what turned me onto anime it also a slight bit disturbing but you know a well a i do that u st century human need to be disturbed once in a while i always loved the music from the dvd so decided why not get the soundtrack and i did what i didnt expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie in musical term there only one track on this cd that i dont like and thats saying a lot it an interesting journey through a synthetic world via trance and techno beat check it out you wont be disappointed
0	this song is pretty slow i think i dont know why i didnt wish it i just didnt wish it very much
0	sum ha always been a band i looked down upon their cd chuck really anti impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason id like it and this album is very similar in that aspect the only reason id ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually at least close to punk but besides that nothing really appeal to me rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk i dont suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back
0	for all the serious euphony i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare
1	this is a song that will probably be one that is an all time hit i love everything about it
1	michael john poirier ha a soothing voice that match his sublime lyric i love two song on this album especially forgiven and the maiden and the messenger forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who ha an angelic voice i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it asking what i thought of the song i loved it the first time i heard it and have loved it ever since the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you hear it i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head the album is worth it for just these two song the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ drawn by a mutual friend
0	the music is fountainhead layed out and engineered extremely fountainhead but the lyric make me want to slap this guy for being a whining as his voice bore the crap out of me

1	i love this album favorite include anthem run outlaw scared chasing twister and my whole life long after it all make me weep with joy if youve never seen them live dont miss the chance anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand take few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live
0	i tally with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there it is a proper extended dance blend much in the vein of it a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl group or then cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side cover with a techno dub feel a la s flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slow down down so it feel comparable an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there it is the second best version of all the remixes
1	from one of my favorite movie this song can bring out so much emotion and feeling love love it
1	another stellar album from the awesome jenny beautiful and finely crafter all the elbow room through
0	i just came here to read the description trying to figure out why this showed up on a prime search for christian three is nothing about it if anything it new age

1	air zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here inwards seem to think if youre stuck in the early s or bust mentality of cooper fandom then this alike album isnt multiplication for you but zcs is strong from beggining to end with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious adaptable i like girl remarkably insincere all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them mainly because of the lyric this wa comprise the third of a comprise strong trilogy of alices s album the others being flush the fashion accept and special force all three while they dont match most range of his s album deliver the hard rock good while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand up comic it work the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of i am the future which should have tipped u off to what wa to come namely the dreadful dada album
1	i love how her music let you create your own imaginative scenario or remember special thing sometimes no word are necessary and her music allows you to go to word a quiet place and not be distracted by lyric and produce allows you to be with your own thought
0	this make no sense note to god is not an original song from charice the song is from jojos album the highroad that came out in for charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know it not make no sense i am a very big fan of jojo but not so much of charice anymore

0	major disappointment always been a huge bh comprise fan from way back the songwriting is trite and uninspired take no chance musically dont get me started on the ridiculous political statement forever he is trying to make with the title track utterly forgettable album

0	i would rate this cd a just ok for the money there are better sounding version out there this ha the uk mix which sound flat and lifeless it ha bonus track ironically from the u lp which are already on the album a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like ill get you baby it you i give it star out of a possible
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade at to the lowest degree superman wa able to produce some brilliance in this area like blue christmas this is tweedily dumb
0	the creedence clearwater revival mardi gras is often hailed the all time worst album by a major rock group i strongly believe this t j s album ha it way beat at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual it just the rest of the group really that album i couldnt find one worthy song on this dont get me wrong i love most of t j s other song but this album is just so bad tommy james the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with one le hit than ccr if you count the tommy james solo hit draggin the line then theyre tied bottom line is ccr wa a classic album group and t j s were strictly a single group
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need it for exampl e because of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder a complete and utter waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence but will certainly line the pocket of daniel goleman dont waste your money on this no help whatsover book
1	they just dont make song like this anymore very good song recived in great condition
1	excellent album by christopher cross i bought extra copy for friend
1	two icon making great music together
0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion his guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash he lack the inspiration playing with his band he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby nash to step up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe
1	i love hawaiian iodin music i used to own two hawaiian cd but never really liked them this cd is incredible and i will always listen to the song when i am on the beach
1	promise made on signal mountain ha to be one of the most beautiful song ive ever heard this entire cd is so calming i cant explain the sense of peace that come over me when i listen to it if youre looking for something slow down and lift up i would highly recommend it
0	so now dont pay to download an actual file you pay to listen to one song at a time in yet another music playing app i already pay for spotify i only wanted an mp to make into a ringtone this is useless to me

0	i love the soundtrack to psycho it unspeakable one of my favorite information technology of all time so you can imagine how delighted i wa to see this release wa available i bought it a soon a i saw it and wa excited when it showed up on my doorstep i put it on my turntable and wa horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality wa it wa like someone soundtrack had held a tape recorder up to an old information technology tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs alike i couldnt believe how dreadful it sounded and absolute insult to bernard herman classic score so if youre like me and collect and enjoy listening to soundtrack on corrupt vinyl do yourself a favor and dont make the same mistake i did
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song this direction one is a great example
0	this composition while ambitious and promising at sealed point never really take off the composer relies too intemperately on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument but doesnt go anywhere with it the theme never recrudesce and the variation arent all that different from each other i had high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion but it wa just more of the same i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new steering however
0	ok relaxation music but it just doesnt do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into medicine bed and nod off
0	i had to pay to listen to this song even im a prime member and it is prime music

0	not a great a his previous cd some great tune but mostly a disappointment i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an mp would best suit you
0	this guy is not funny he mean spirited and intolerant i hated it im no account i spent my money on it
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one forthcoming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban version the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people observe this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self fink music sharp set groban fan who is just felicitous to hear new music after several geezerhood and if you have memory access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it starting time before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarize auditor and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy starting time my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with st david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly counter this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seem to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that he done that and yet at the same time i consider he charged off in many different way i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen clock time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a strengthener of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the track the dent cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian strain massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrorise me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to accomplish to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i determine the lyric at clock time to be simplistic and a unsound stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly trust that groban judging from awakes february strain can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really lack to because they have a great observe for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an creative person and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont lack to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do spat artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i compliment i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it last out in the packaging to be endow to soul that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived recoil to the album my gloss came a a result of a thread on his official board entitle be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely consider that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new creative person to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrong a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely further the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i consider it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
1	this is my pick if you need a song to get you started begin on a long road trip to fight vampire demon and werewolf

1	why dont we see this chick on tv ive heard her only at time on the radio and her rendition are so smooth and sentimental so well done that she should be way on top
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i to admit this the album of his ive bought and no in case youre the inclusion of god bless usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt thing though ill get right to the save any more small talk i expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number mainstream nasvhille songwriter thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other and turn them into something memorable of em deal with love of course almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you cant move is about getting on with life through hardship round take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure but his is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but album is a musical gem it may not stronger time but it definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and with it lee greenwood stronger than time
0	capital music obviously but awful remastering even worse than the cd chrome box sound thin and tinny similar it coming out of a transistor radio the mighty chrome deserve better but theyll never get it a long a theyre on cleopatra

0	offensive and shouldnt be a part of the free christmas up what were you thinking
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such little imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the music world history and that they do it very badly band like the people touch white witch armageddon and the list go on and on were extraordinary one of a kind and yet modern band continue to take those name for themseles then release inferior common boring music and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in on the name of others pathetic

0	it a good song but nicky minaj is featured i dont like the way she sings
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive even for some of the least regarded artist and album i dont know how to account for that it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they arent likely to end up with something they dont like unlike in time past i received this album a a gift this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music soul r b rock folk etc like ccr in the late s they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention this group also grab your attention in that it a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar which is unusual to be frank this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric but unlike ccr this album is tuneless in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen i have listened to it twice not sure if i can do it one more time but i will because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me i really want to like this group but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head ill come back to update this review if it grows on me
0	henley is a lyrical and musical comedy genius but he dumbs it down to country on this release i dont know if it pandering or just plain laziness at any rate it a disappointment the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world musically it either country valse or three chord rockabilly dont waste your money on this one

1	what can i say the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music upstanding original and unique i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond young woman then i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me you cherri denniss attain i love you finally he order out his first self titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan didnt get the recognition it desereved but the world just wasnt ready now my fav underated artist producer is back with his second album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first one on this album ryan is more laid back and pick out affair slow i am in love with the infectious william ashley sunday night i am also glad he order awesome resuce you which is only on the bonus cd your not my young woman is a funky moderate track that take you back to the olskool zodiac is another groovy track overall this album it totally different than the first one but a a loyal fan im gon na say get the album anyway and indorse this talented valet side by side selection
0	never heard this version before would have been nice to have been nice if l had been made aware that there wa various artist this fifty fifty is not even fifty fifty the guy who wrote the song cohn or cohen even though llove the song l had to delete this version immediately waste of money
0	pay atttention from a mix tape and doe not have the unscathed song pointless
1	the song is one of roberta flack most memorable song dating back to the seventy when she sang at mr henry in dc
0	disk skipped harrow in place
0	couldnt stomach much of this slow lifeless a great deal abomination of the real symphony depressing
1	the song is great ive been listening to it for year it just what i expected thats the reason i bought it ive been buying song from amazon since they started selling them im going to simulate this and paste it to every song that i review i hope you do the same
0	had i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ugghhhh other cd this same comment damn since i dont remember them i most likely dont have a copy of the original order where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ugghhhh
1	i found this worship cd in a fund randomly it ha some of the best praise and worship song ever i cant help but get up and praise my god when i hear these song what a blessing
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording sound engineer of any kind once so ever however this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener auditory sensation preferably empty the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late s would have have submitted to society a a show i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies but with this album i die to see that expansion and if anything the feel appears to be reflecting the mood not neccessairly the word of the so called economic recovery of the united state overall if this were his first album it would receive a higher rating but it is not i sincerely find it awesome that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording academic term i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry hollow and nearly flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording i suggest finding someone else
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to military life during war this song and lyric are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience and a to the troop especially those who have served in combat per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self control and were just complacent killer
1	good record album
1	this song is therapeutic one of those song that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self
0	horrible i only bought it because the ex girlfriend wanted it i wish there wa a no star rating
0	i think it a shame that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything like it lacuna coil or echo of eternity this is by far the worst cd ive gotten in a long time and the first that made me write a review the singer may iodin be the worst ive ever heard even my cat cd sound better i am very bitter about the i former armed force gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music
1	i just iodin really like this song
0	another overrated band to grace the late night tv airwave they dont have much to back up their night acclaim though notable song are lacking this album sound like a kid garage arrangement on home
1	if you watched tv show then you already know how catchy the song are the only difference between tv and cd is probably length i havent actually verified this but it some of the song on the cd are longer and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music
0	vast wz and rz here this album is a bit disappointing some have equated it to an ep and i agree i believe rob is believing any crap he put out there is cool well it aint love john s playing and hope rob put out more serious lyric and euphony next time
1	this song is very special to me a im a proud navy wife any song that honor the military is great this song wa played at the funeral of a very special navy seal it always brings tear to my eye
0	not a bad bond title song but no excuse why this is not on soundtrack cd adele should be boycotted barbara should be ashamed of herself causing cubby to roll over in his engrave
1	saw the video recording for this song back when mtv wa mtv loved the funky vibe make you want to put on a hat and dance on a theater stage it doe for me
0	first of all let me start out by saying that while ive been a huge fan of the band since the earliest solar day im not i of those definitive chicago winnow who hate the s stuff in fact chicago is i of my favorite album by the band and is an album that they have every compensate to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them at that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have been it for the that period of the band they then played out the next day releasing various compiling live and christmas album some of which were considered part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of winnow were very curious to insure what this new album would bring a return to the manipulation of roman numeric indicate a potential to return to the definitive sound a even if completely coincidental manipulation of triple x hinted a something edgy instead they inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to make any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say im sorry on this record but radio wouldnt have played it in any case so why even attempt to go down that path who were they try to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt flunk there isnt much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone the song are weakly and the arrangement and production is tired i can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile travail in the first place it doe serve to make weakly album like xiv and seem not so bad in look back though what chicago need to do what virtually all of their winnow would like to insure is a return to experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the s but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly written tune in an interesting manner and let be honest even a lot of the material on their early record werent great song but the arrangement were virtually always strong growing and interesting itd be squeamish to insure them at least attempt a real comeback album or possibly they dont want to which is finely but then it probably best to just limit future release to compiling and live album
1	the presentation of this well know musical piece is superbly performed by the london philharmonic orchestra if you havent listened it in a while i strongly that you revisit it you wont be disappointed

0	where did all the right and emotion filled lyric go while the music may have at least attempted to go back to from here to hospital it stopped dead by skibas part and lyric such a on draculina and the american scream his raw passionate word have turn into this terrible set about at clean song and now song just seem awkward when he decides to shed the f word into them eating me alive dan manages to save some of the album with off the map out and fine but once again they lyric are sub par dont get me wrong i dont hate the trio theyre my favorite band but they could do so much better than this i wanted to like it and went into it with an open mind but after a few listens nothing stuck out and i didnt even out feel the need to take heed to it eer again if you really deficiency a good alkaline trio record go pick up nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href good mourning dp b yjda ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf good mourning a nbsp and anything before it if youve listened to this unmatchable and like it go try out nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href from here to hospital dp b b xu ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf from here to hospital a nbsp or nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href goddamnit dp b gm y ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf goddamnit a nbsp i prognosticate theyre so much better

1	this cd is so relaxing when im drifting off to sleep rain is my favorite nature sound so you can imagine how often i use this cd the sound quality is exceptional i couldnt be happier
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk it even above that silent night one that wa re covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior through song
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only leave off once ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate and his voice is nothing special his butchering of sung dynasty on broadway is particularly heinous id have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune a waste of money
1	it weird and kinda creepy but i love it
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the literal cd ive always liked dj shadow and wa interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now in it is typical shadow ambiance and come up sound but some track have wildly swung upset beat pattern like flying lotus and the like a few track attempt a dubstep feel but it come across a plodding a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern those actually sound the coolest the part that make me absolutely disfavour the album even though part are ok is the rapper in the rap track that state that trump ha sexual activity with his immature daughter so eff that rapper i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wan na lose half of your audience moby just did the same im deal all his cd now a he mouthed off too about trump

0	i so much wanted to love this album dylan a sinatra he must really believe that he doesnt bad but it wa painful to listen to the off key croaking i love dylan and ive been a of frank for a long time the longing and emotion evident but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much i am very disappointed but will listen when the weather warms up and i drive along the ocean with my window open

0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i wa youll be very disappointed at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor girl you have the talent so please get back to your root gary w hill

0	the book think grow rich is a must own it is book to be read multiple time that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone he doesnt pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second the narrator ha a strong voice it just emotionless it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming bottomline buy the book buy the audio book just skip this one

1	i fall back my cd of the manhattan so i picked up my hit here great love song
1	beautiful great acoustic great ballad
1	this second single from the new album rise release june is more of a baron ballad john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song but it is still a good song with a great message of letting love cut through the noise of our culture if you are familiar with skillet believe along the line of lucy although american language noise is not a story song if you are not familiar with the band just believe of a regular baron ballad from a good s rock band
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless later the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt thing though helium ill get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some piece more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwood comprise voice is rich and dispense pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any townspeople other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a comprise fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you cant move is about whatever getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town the state and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee in front greenwood isnt trying anything helium new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be corrupt sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess clutch photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it definitely the album of the moment good turn so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time

0	i love the classic moonglows recording so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to the time to digitize oops i downloaded i wa wrong and wa completely not the doo wop version of the song this version ha a strong background track it is highly produced it is just off this is just my but the new version of the tune wa and not what i wa looking for at all anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these
1	yes yes yes
1	one of the realest rapper in tangible the game right now j cole ha never disappointed and this album is no exception forest hill dive is his best album to date and best album of for sure
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song it beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country music from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere with just the right touch of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i give it a solid recommendation
1	great price product a declared stated no problem
0	of the song on the cd are fray
0	i paid for the song because i wanted the mp after i paid for it will only let me to it through amazon that doe me no good i want the mp i paid for

1	i mean seriously if you dont know and love this song you either shouldnt be listening to the door or something is wrong with you totally i know it college music these day but all the same
0	this say it is the clean version but it is not
1	decent nice
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well closer without question is his very best album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without question the worst there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day his voice is unlike any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous accomplishment i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his producer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the producer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next album heck if it wa me i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy
1	reverend

0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song the rest is well all filler and the disk is only half an minute long so there are only about another five complete song track one is a admonisher of maiden s number of the beast and track three is second long it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two run into single wrote the rest of the album a well piece of advice tape or download the single and spend your money on something else

0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha potential but he sunk what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range he sounded sort of screechy the title track wa also somewhat misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song not a sad one i do think peter could do really fountainhead if he learned to work within his vocal range and select practiced material to sing

1	i wa so happy to find this song for kindle fire it easily my itunes absolutely love it
0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening how can anybody honestly think nirvana saved rock n roll if you me nirvana any grunge band for that matter is about far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to listen life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making music purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an s thing to do then s is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i took all my pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i it all to ditching my grunge cd i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge

1	musical perfection from the foo fighter a usual
1	i think this album is a vast jump off forward for lifehouse they have really grown together a a band the song on this record book are much more upbeat than on the last album but they have not lost the depth jason lyric express the importance of being able bodied to expect to the future and enjoy life rather than dwelling on the past the vocal are also much more powerful jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing this is evident on the track ground wash and spin on the track my precious we experience to hear his amazing falsetto and on the title track stanley climbfall he is absolutely electrical other highlight on the record book are sky is falling am i ever gon na find out and take me away however this is one of those album where every song is corking and can be listened to over and over again there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure the song will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life drop at you i highly recommend that you give this record book a listen

1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel this is pure evil coming from saint thomas bergersen and nick pheonix some of the song are downright painful to listen to but they are still fascinating to listen to most of the music in this album come from their for the first time few collection such a vestige and nightmare ash and dynasty there is a much much coloured evil grating sound it the kind of sound youd expect from an outstanding revulsion movie for whatever reason the song to die on halloween is hand down the creepiest song in this whole album it ha a very light almost fun bounce to it but the lyric are downright horrifying chop off a limb batter and bake what do we set out from the light of the sun a foul burn now isnt that fun it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid it just fantastically bright

1	i love this song because it is really catchy and fun and ha cute lyric david archuleta win again
0	i love these song but the quality of the album wa awful every song trot horribly especially demon please release a better version
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era release because theyre a little difficult to find but given the fact that the vast majority her work subsequent to the s fall into the pop and light jazz genre i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever wa trying to nudge her into alt rock tane herself wa more interested in pop and light jazz but acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an artist is going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an or two more straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice well suited for it hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should up at their first opportunity because although it ha some minor downside it akin to a buried pop rock treasure there no track listing here ill do a blow by blow give it back start with a strange almost playful verse some wonderfully unexpected twist chord pick up a stark thin drumbeat then dive into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverse a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion later some subtle keyboard but here where tanes unique voice shine through it difficult for me to explain why but her voice me of phoebe snow maybe it because of that strange vibrato which sound both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keep jumping out at me even year after i first heard this disc cut the fruit is a little funky little jazzy with beautiful floating transitional groove between verse and chorus there a satisfying gnarly guitar break in the then back to glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again it vocal over guitar something that bore the hell out of me the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of weird instrumentation synth wash and french accordion but it all mesh the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the guitar is rarely relegated that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing of the mix how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that put a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cry whether thats incidental or intentional it just make me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier part are noticeably distorted you have push that annoyance because memoria is epic one of those song thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begin soft a a feather build and build explodes in anthemic chorus then after a brief bridge turn a corner into an unexpected melodically passage that build to it own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same a feather place it started this is of those tune you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life a song thats been with you for year that folk powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves it unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus but great song no joker start with tanes vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the chorus which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeat of the line i wan na your woman i wan na be your woman it not a horrid song but to me the chorus awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst there also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the chorus the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song which lead me to believe it one those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most phrase in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree close out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly there are two break into slower tempo groove that are actually powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album hetero is standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her s disc if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voice get hetero definitely time well spent
1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some williams country tune the version on here of tumblin alone is worth price of the album also get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there anything wrong with that it just a refreshing change for his fan

1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal globe the globe of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly push over the past few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal globe for not being tough enough ha finally found a niche of it own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh thought along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well deserving owning while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then periphery will be right at dwelling in your collection

0	the book think grow rich is a must own it is ampere book to be read multiple time that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone he doesnt pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second the narrator ha a strong voice it just emotionless it reminded me of when a teacher would cue call on a student to read hold out aloud but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it promptly a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming bottomline buy the book buy the audio book just skip this one

0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when lie in a chorus of childrens voice started chiming in i inwards dont recall that from simply the movie at all i enjoy the movie very much but i cant recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the pious platitude movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd i should have demoed inwards the song before ordering but i do like the disco song that are not available for download
0	the cd non did not play i purchased volume and volume but volume doe not play and the paper and receipt were not saved highly disappointed
1	one mary well best no problem with download
0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol i had heard this song on the radio probably too much and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today i have to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now given the whole chris brown thing it make me feel disgusted about him in general but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long i know you can both sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal to a lot of people just not me just my opinion
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters
1	smashing great
1	love this corney song i play for anyones birthday
1	great quality super fast download
0	it a good song but nicky minaj is featured comprise i dont like the way she sings
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample very good i enjoyed most every song except carried by the wind when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier a simply if id heard it before i listened a few more time and yes angstrom i had heard it before it a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album i listened to yannis listen version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song but not only that farish also inserted the same clip of child laughing that amethystium us away in their song avalon from their odonata album accept whats up with that unless there good explanation iodin for this copying the song carried by the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me
0	im sure render because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war this song and it lyric are along whimsical nonsense based on no real experience and a shame to the troop especially those who have served in combat per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self world health organization control and were mostly just complacent killer

1	k is the most visionary musically expressively complex difficult to bring off of mozart concerto a true concerto for wind instrument piano and orchestra fischer a conductor extract unusually well balanced articulate expressive from this minor orchestra in itself a remarkable feat while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work some might question whether is mozart styled performance no but it should be i am often an admirer of period performance but is a between period and fundamentally eternal forgive old fashioned rhetoric this review is based on another company lp issue of the same performance fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are now imagine why

1	instead air return with love comprise their best work in my tropic opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to gamey this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air minute more accessible pop tune to date with sing sang sung with this type of contrast notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the song sound like something from turned hz legend with it multi layered synth forefront air and distorted voice effect not the album strongest vent but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your typical second song it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop caption into a nice soft like inaugurate piece with a great chord progression and melody the glockenspiel add an awesome feel sound like something youd hear at the end of moon safari especially the later half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony era tug with the song being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or read somewhere that this will be the second single off the album an odd decision i believe but who comprise know maybe it need more listens the song seems hearer a little bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a song youd think air would tug produce with it western like feel the song sound like something off a surfing documentary it fun but also lack differentiation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest record album song on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an ampere interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd know what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set and this song is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen ampere tropical information technology disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention range so auditor far with regard to lyrical absence ive always song been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it take a higher level degree of musical cutting edge integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical presence the song sound like two turned into one the non first half is up beat and ha once again a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like harp of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill loose out number with it swirling progression especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune night hunter another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of hz legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition ampere to the second half of the album and an homage to the absence seizure lighter side one half of air sing sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop song to date with an advance amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that accept sound like something from vent a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it delivery there just enough contrast take to tune between chorus verse couplet and confine so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this babble out album nay all over air themselves tug this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the song is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter half of the album with it brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces long an awesome awing little synth melody line which is bound frequently to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one new star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this a it little sister acoustic and once again laid back in it trump approach this tune is a near perfect night associate in nursing song with it distorted harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and inwards take you to a calmer place record album african velvet whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it hand picked guitar segment and it front line horn melody it a perfect way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this effort well from air four star in the end but im not ruing out a higher score it definitely an soft album that need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who been hanging for a different approach death fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously released id jolly say hz legend on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making of attracting front line a whole new market denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a record album few listens itll grow on you trust me

0	nothing wrong with ac dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac pine tree state dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album dense they are touring behind for me this tends to get boring and president andrew johnson if you buy one live set by this band it all you need well keep maybe two if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc they still perform dull well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet hit package or live album get boring

0	i agree with the two other reassessment saying still is tired here nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is perish thru the motion his guitar solo are good however his voice sound weak due to age i guess and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash he lack the inhalation playing with his band he need youthful to ill use up and challenge him on degree to really get him perish with guitar and crosby nash to ill use up his vocal i wa disappointed with this cd dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while maybe

0	wow talk about zero originality what do you do when you cant come up with anything original to save your life ripoff an old surf instrumental what else
0	some is a bit catchy but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to
0	this review is adaptation only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal dont sound loud enough the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track it baffle me how record comprise company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song information technology are record album great but the remastering wa entirely pointless

0	in general i dislike live recording for two reason in an actual concert interview are often ailment behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into frolic that affect the performance of the day no creative person should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control a if that wa the artist last book on the music this is grossly unjust and review rarely acknowledge the difference but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work let me put it this way if i audition a work and read the score i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic randomness dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing and it is no different with all the foreign randomness that a live performance may enshrine so my purpose is defeated it is a different matter if i like to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time exceptio probat regulam it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance phone call it lucky if you will but such recording exist the album under review is one such moreover it competes head on with another read of the same force made in the studio and it come off the better franz schubert no or or depending on which momentary academician fashion is in force wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete franz schubert issue it ha several defect the sound is boxy and dull painting an boiler suit lady jane grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra davis play all the repeat in every movement for a studio reading this is idiotic since it make all the movement much longer than their natural contented would warrant without adding anything other than the same music again the performance is routine all the way through davis having one of his most uninspired day all point conduce to an unutterably boring account saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra another time h auml nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance on that day davis produced something entirely different he wa alive and alert judged tempo judiciously and i suspicious played to the audience instead of the microphone moreover he geld the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense case played out within of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not replicate but piddle their point in the stretch of the drama once and for all mvmts melody are not trundled on mindlessly a dozen time mvmts and most significantly the vivacity of most of mvmts and is not sacrificed to academician criterion but to a situation of living music making even the sound is an betterment on the studio read the query continue in the end where to place these recording but i think i have answered that query implicitly the studio read might be located in an arbitrary place draw near all the other indifferently conceived but well played recording e g in the neighborhood of muti karajan ormandy steinberg boston et al the live read move up a considerable number of slot it is not top class a defined by the classic recording of krips b ouml hm and wand berlin but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt dresden bernstein concertgebouw giulini chicago tennstedt and solti an honourable place even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio read

0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it a shame what pass for hip hop these day people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all because lil wayne is whack im not a hater i dont gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pas off a hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a little more substance in my music

0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel ilk ive turn up with her music first off her voice is absolutely amazing some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million most people that came up around christinas time dont even compare in vocal range she had such a bad voice for a dada star who didnt mystify a chance to really show off her attainment or her existent personality with her first album but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own term and in her own word stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time she sang from the heart and great experience she hold u on a journey of finding her own voice in the figurative and erratum sense writing her own song and working with the people she wanted to work with teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing shes ever coiffure career wise i dont recognize what happened between them but she hasnt been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work it didnt quite catch the essence of strippeds christina bionic wa a huge fail even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadow by truly horrible dada song lotus wa an even heavy fail that made me wonder if christinas rule wa up after stripped there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it star but they are nowhere near memorable it really suck because xtina is a truly gifted individual but either she need to retire from music or mystify it together

0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the lyric come off a weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer basher overall i pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flower voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos that said like star the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blue magoos histrion producer bob wyld these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this leash time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial regardless initiative of their history ive always been upwards a life history big blue magoos fan but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the catalogue rascal got away from their creative strength like that other band this roughly collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence with three percussionist in the mix psyche track like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried come out in layer of latin flavored percussion medicine and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sound the same disease the combination think avail of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy move flatulent horn and aimless vibe may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problem neither ka shown a kaz on the writing credit nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight propelled by alfred elli on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number in alphabet the positive column this wa the album shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the require song wa a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocal and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion elli endless sax solo just made thing worse rating star slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary position groove but the harsh strained lead vocal ampere the psyche rather jazzy touch discordance sax solo apparently meant to sound like jungle animal vibe dense and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile rating star and then there wa the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then thing turned horribly wrong hideous group vocal i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solo imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar inadequate and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating star penned by newcomer elli comprise the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator disconnect music and youll get a feel for this one technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for companionship individual solo but it wa also sort of soulless rating star tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the slide originative instrumental sea breeze express wa support best describe a a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folk that go bonkers for this roughly kind accept of free form stuff but to my ear it basically noise rating star the album wa also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the year ugliest cover blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help in the lead sale all told a sad all the same footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz defective emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get death enough of you eric kaz side nigh pious platitude magoos blue instrumental alfred elli tonight the sky about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric hour kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred elli richie dickon jim payne john atrocious liello j blue lopresti for anyone interested matter the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at

0	ok jason moran is a piano virtuoso if you still did not know this is a reason to listen to this do work the problem come when you are looking for something else this album is a jazz trio but what about the other two well overshadowed by the soloist although better that way and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise the true statement is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be frustrated to top it off the theme include in this album are dampen and flat
0	he tried something new but it did exploit not work

1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first learn year after it came out it wa really good but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other later artist i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic ampere version is clearer and sound more energetic acoustical than the original which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track

0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter mostly a good cover band with a livewire athletic promoter up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock and roll probably a great bar band when they started out i saw them twice in their early day when i wa a teenager who didnt care that dlr wa a second rate singer at best loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band unfortunately whatsoever vocal talent he ever possessed ha long since evaporated david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock and roll vocalist of the s were bad nor in the way that many older rock and roll icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal charm a they get older he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within foot of a microphone sorry still he clearly know it and rather than try harder he doesnt even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their low water mark unforgivable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting populace
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend to have heavier beat and are great dance song vitas singing usually in a middle register track were co written by vitas track and written by alone total playing time is i adore this cd it hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance joy enthusiasm and love vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating minimum a like many performer especially those from distant land is plagued with pirated disc play list a kiss long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad wheres you there me ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoe dont keep silence so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound unlucky a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy half night half day irresistible try not dancing to this one i you in short and a t shirt those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor this one street of capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i in love with sweet gentleness this is all love internet mood no lyric in one just techno sound and voice instrument

0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd no idea why the review were so impressive someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath pure insult his vocal are very poor but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a isch fuzztone that sound ancient all the solo are pointless finger exercise there are about or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar
0	i lovemaking terrance and his acting is superb he just can not sing but he can really play the guitar i paid for the cd and there were only song i recreate a little i enjoyed the spanish type song maybe if he wa able to sing more soulful anyway dont pay the cd but i lovemaking you terrance you are one of my fav histrion

0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation i hope his next one will be great like comprise he is on the road with his band
0	this album wa a huge letdown it is way too melodic and popish commercial light rock being a huge fan of all that remains owning all of their other album having winnow gone to their show this album wa a major disappointment sr melodic can be cool if it is still heavy like on their older album but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me i dont like the direction they have gone in i liked the first single they released which relinquish prompted me to purchase this album inwards but the rest of it wa john major dissatisfactory i dont recommend this album to hardcore and metalcore fan

0	i wa very excited for this record album to come out i have been a fan of river and the w since childhood im only on my first day of listening but am in scandalize at the quality big hype over this record album and all it is is random jammy song put into an record album plus ive heard half of these song in the past with the same quality or better not too impressed but i will always purchase weezer related record album for support but after the green record album make believe and now this im a bit turned off lover in the snow blast off who you callin bitch are the only worthy song again ive heard these before this record album go bribe the low deluxe record album it a way better bribe
0	there is only one song on this cd worth listening to i recoment getting the mp version of tarzan boy and ignore the rest of the song
0	this cd length singe track audio song is really just effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound generally the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl probably jaguar or leapord loudly punctuates the sequence it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered once you know this is present in this it becomes difficult to relax enjoy listening to it again imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour now try to relax
0	im sorry but i did not like this cd i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen very good song but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kid are very talented and great musician however i thought the song writing wa bad the lyric bad and the vocal were bad vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own signature and personality into them not just read them off the sheet of paper she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent remember her janis joplin cover turtle blue thats what im talking about she need to do more of that this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd somebody need to help them with their songwriting it wa all over the place on this cd im hoping they can turn it around but for now im backing off for a while to see where they go from here good luck you guy
1	i absolutely love this song which manages to be both depressing a strangely end of the world kind of way and keep you interested
0	usually attract when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r b youre in for accept some rare treasure this is not one of those kind missed of cd the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hook this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost
0	first off id like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song on the other hand i dont really like this album a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to but i dont get far in when i have to skip track stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to but the other song are sub standard they consist of poor lyric dodgy music and ridiculous spelling this way is by far jewel best album i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel something which is actually credible leave this to britney mandy and jessica oh and jewel keep your clothes on it not big and it not clever you dont need to sell your body to sell record
0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my home i know this to be true because i do not own this atomic number or any reo speedwagon music

1	great price product a stated no problem
1	you know im just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the difference from original to remastered but i will say paying or or for this seven albulm set is tremendous i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fan i became aware during the born in the usa tour then purchased all the previous cassette so in the last year cassette were lost and or became obsolete now i am able to purchase all seven for what amount to each thats a win right there and like a number of people i find the first seven springsteen to be the best sans a couple of live album so win squared to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with

1	this is a very good cd for the price i bought this cd just iodin for that one song that i didnt have but wanted
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt thing though ill get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all usa is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter thats the bad thing the good thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he take these song absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you cant move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here take a look at small town and the new excellent emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever lee greenwood isnt trying anything new here this is territory thats been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of timing and style is un matched aside from the excess photography not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and along with it lee greenwood stronger than time

0	what i and always say is that when artist ha to come out with a song they dont actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r b voice and sound in her music it actually hasnt actually drove the point her without me with kelly roland and missy elliot the second single from album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound or something that ciara would make i definitely wa not that impressed with the and it definitely is fantasia low point song d
1	beautiful great acoustic great lay
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is shocking but ha an attractive and innocent face i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical raceway honest face is more for those who can look yesteryear the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womaniser and maneaters

1	phenomenal recording on th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd it command premium in the collector market and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician i remember when i had the track of this back in the s that i played to death still have a mint condition vinyl copy and cover that i guard with my life if it doesnt come out on cd soon i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format which i have done with many out of print vinyl album still unavailable on cd this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it the writing arranging and playing on jamal play jamal is superb with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horn and string by evans two of the piece pasture and death resurrection are particularly sub lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra eclipse dialogue and spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill a well my favorite piece on the album swahililand is also the longest at almost ten minute and is an extended magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horn and string before he kick in with the main section on fender rhodes weston is astounding on conga al ternating from left channel to right jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the tour de force it the final track on the album and close it out in fine fashion extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing arranging and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and paul serrano i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the year and dearly love his early impulse work but jamal play jamal is my favorite of his a stellar work of art that once again is long overdue for cd release another desert island disc p s had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover sound better than ever

1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording which is often far from modern convention i personally think this is one the that i have heard of the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and quite far from heifetz milstein and younger violinist if like more objective style this is not the best option stay with szeryng or milstein

1	this song of epic proportion broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew it instilled in my heart such wonder that i can not even write in word how wonderfully wonderful it truly is gangnam style not only fill your entire soul yes the entire soul with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying everythings alright that tone form in the back of my mind every time i hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul it keep whispering in my ear go on go over you can do it just a little longer this song eclipse all other work of music nay work of art in the world today beethoven would be proud but he dead keep on gangnam keep on
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas renowned upper register and is a very successful song most of the track on this release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song with vitas singing usually in a middle register track and were co written by vitas track and written by him alone total playing time is i simply adore this cd it intemperately to imagine hearing it without being energized by it teemingness of rejoice enthusiasm and bed vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity it impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from always chose a reputable vendor with the high pitched rating a minimum of a vitas like many performer especially those from distant land is hassle with pirated disc play list a kiss a long a eternity beautiful melodic ballad wheres you there me kuda ti tuda ya get on your dancing shoe dont keep secrecy so loudly fabulous with some exotic techno sound unlucky a melodic line that will make you feel most fortunate and well chosen half night half day absolutely irresistible heartbeat prove not dancing to this one i make bold you in short and a t shirt keep those dancing shoe on mantra nice techno flavor in this one street of the capital a cheerful bouncy song with a hint of that upper register i believe in bed with sweet gentleness this is all bed internet mood no lyric in this one just techno sound and the voice a legal document

0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl album we have not so this is a cd set and load of track many of them are kind of style strange slow singing and empty feeling there were a few pleasant traditional piece but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there if you want to experiment it might be worth the money but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music would not recommend this

0	merchandising why is amazon selling nazi propaganda
1	good
0	bwb is a great collaboration but this album dropped the ball every other track is a watered down singing song that doesnt rightly fit in any genre the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work im not sure what engrossed for that wa but the next album take to be smooth jazz through and through not this
1	personally i liked the original version of the song from the movie but i love this version best
0	this is not mine
0	a rehash of very old willie poorly recorded retrograde cut of the early year total disappointment look for better collection
1	i have done to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk it even above that silent night one that wa re covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist built in alone i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic roll in the hay loop of admiring immense posterior through song
1	this cd is hilarious i admit there are some song arent really funny but there always or bad song on an album in this one the bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song if you are easily offended by swearing raciest dont worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in way then dont buy this but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song buy this album
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song for you
0	once id downloaded this song i felt deceived by the sample clip available here cincotti definitely ha iodin potential but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond jolly his range he sounded rather screechy the title track wa also somewhat distressing misleading because it led me to expect a slow tender seduction song not a sad one i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable his album wa the he wa starting to define his style and find worthy the is weak and the lyric are laughable is a slickly produced attempt to make him mainstream pop star he wa never that his forte wa wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word his interpretation of classic on american idol mad world track of my tear made the song his own he toured with queen and wa a good or live than freddie mercury vocally even though he couldnt match his stage presence or personality i guess his first two cd didnt sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder so this is a ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber we dont need shallow electronica pop disco clone good luck adam i think you have lost the majority of your fan base you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad
1	i found this binaural suggestion online and have been able to get to sleep often more easilywith this in the background
0	this is just terrible song period it just bad it actually make little sense it wa written to enkindle a heart felt response but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day

0	what the others say is true i bought this cd back in the early i shortly attain it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp no stereo and one song play faster than it should i have the original mercury stereo lp all track were stereo except one just an fyi the stereo lp version of please dont talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the let go version you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube search for diane ray stereo
1	this album much
0	the album is great so dont think the star are for that it get lower star rating because it censored the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doesnt tell you this when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled explicit but one that is clean ha nothing like censored or clean next to it jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i didnt think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people dont get screwed over i know im not the only one who had this problem and this isnt the only album for which this is a issue again great album but buy the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download
0	jimmy and ian anderson jethro tull both knew limitation and talent so when they put out album they knew what would work and what and made their musical selection accordingly youll notice buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull religious only a instrumental arrangement but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious and absolutely wrong what is left of his voice but big name produce big fear and so we have this piece of musical garbage many have the only piece that work at all is must be santa and that is because of what he doe with the reindeer name everything else is like nail on a chalkboard doesnt dylan have enough money it is but there could a bright side the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high level interrogation but it could be against the geneva convention

1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune the version salsola kali tenuifolia on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album also conventionalize begin you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there anything wrong with that it just a refreshing change for his fan
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip without having any knowledge that there a spoken word ending that hold back a racial spot the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall but it render this song unplayable in my menage i wish i could return an mp im utterly utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able bodied to preview them in their entirety

0	i downloaded this and it start over in the middle of the download a bad one this one and it still cost me so watch when getting this song
0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire the problem started when the band wa denied what they find wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit tot wa the last record album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with a different producer howard steele of heart renown what that agency to the hearer is that the man who for year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitar player songwriter in the business organization wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first non atomic number produced trooper record album sound corresponding well aside from the reasonably solid opener which happens to be the first trooper track id ever heard gage when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some tinny ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this record album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the mathematical product after this one came out they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to add insult to injury they ease ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic triumph although by s tenner they had started to kick some as again this record album represents a menstruation of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their vocalise without their mentor who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ra songwriting but sometimes it what a producer wont let the artist do thats just a important ya know
0	this wa a gift for my daughter for christmas so i cant review this particular
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan accumulation flush if you like sinatra youll be disappointed in dylan interpretation if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with self respect if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it very dismal not flush good for elevator music
0	dont it doesnt have vocal track in the mix it a straight up repeating beat when i previewed it i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample after all it list all of the rapper in the artist column wrong wrong i just spent a buck on half of this song thanks a ton whomever came up with this idea
0	i downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sound perfectly awfully it just way too compressed so it extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range almost unlistenable i honestly dont think you can blame a lot of this on the mp encoding k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have slew of mp s that sound fine with lesser bit rate
0	i downloaded the amazon player and everything and it wont play waste of my i will stick with itunes from now on
0	ive always thought that the best of bon jovi wa richie sambora a he show u in his two previous job but on this album i see the worst of the song of bon jovis last album on the other hand the sound of this cd is very noisy like the style of some album of the s in short and for not doing more blood this cd can be summarized a a couple of good song from a handful of bad and noisy song

0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that wa there the lyric come off a weird in a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all the illusion and wit wa better nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop and now i truly believe that his voice is like honking seal that hurt the ear this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem would hate to see him live in they have not improved their music and have lost fan fyi i not in love with first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and did hate their last album so i solely a killer basher overall i the killer wait it seem some still think the the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flower voice p s while the song when you were young is pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
0	not that bad of tribute cd but a for myself id really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album if youre a major and i do mean major floyd nut you may get more out of this cd than i did the track the great in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy the woman vocalist just go on and on to put it another way moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band tune like speak to me brain damage and eclipse are okay at best

0	i bought this because it popped up a an advertizing on a youtube video of the song but it wasnt the same version a in the video i deleted it
0	zorro is ok the rest is quirky but take a breather poor
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to away pine tree state make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness ampere war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of book an album is done for the sake of consistency god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just record album fine unfortunately this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time personal computer i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit astatine i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list the lyric everything package wise is very good accept and i must say again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped relinquish it to accept my pc using eac record album my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw register that lonerism medicine ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must state that this album music wise is absolutely fantastic if not for the poor comprise mastering i would have easily given the product a i comprise can only hope that in the year and then to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release feel free to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of recent i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the volume level then turned up to the derive point of over compression and distortion drum in cartesian product particular sound much better buy the cd and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album problem one sixth solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the veto cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there
1	xawesomehave heard this song done numerate a number of way this by far is one of the best
1	it classic michael jackson how can you be anything le at thriller it just a album at a great price it time le and can not go wrong with adding this little gem to collection
0	a with child disappointment purchased based on the high praise it received in a recent aarp magazine publication
0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything it a dreadful recording and the vocal on nd chapter are down right ear piercing not in a good way i remember being so much better then again we all thought early christian rock folk music wa delightful
1	i love this song the melody and musicianship great i listen to this song when i lift weight and the morning a i am getting ready for work
0	this wa clean version i want all my music they way the artist intended with f bomb
0	no this is not another ive been a fan of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c isnt a good a she wa on car wheel true ive always liked lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop music shes been a constant factor not always brilliant but always heartfelt and sincere providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country blue and rock her life hasnt always been easy which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it sure she mumble but thats not really the main problem she ha always mumbled all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and strong it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the music itself the complete lack of new tune to be honest i feel ive heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute jam session gone horribly wrong there even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad some review praise her sound which is stripped down and pretty basic to me it sound flat uninterested and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music it the sound of old beer tired muscle and autumn rain it the sound of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job ha lucinda finally lost it have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had more than enough song to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so and in a world where good and original songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one however wa just a big yawn to me

0	ive been a dylan fan from way back and im also a big sinatra fan i write this review from that perspective what ha happened to american that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra and he did these song and im tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put bluntly it is awful no matter what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra best im a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not for dylan fan and certainly not recommended for sinatra fan

0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice only one for kanye wa absolutely awful and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney four five second is absolutely very low for both of them they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting for rihanna it is one of the worst song she ha came out with and she need to really find her voice all over again and for kanye it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done and lost his own voice at the same time for rihanna fan she need much stronger for her next work and she wasted her own time with low gimmick song d

1	leon cut up adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album also you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly stylized singing style on many of his recording not that there anything wrong with that it just a refreshing change for his fan

0	i agree with the previous post these three mix should have been available on the cd version the offer remix is by far the one available from all the version out there it is a proper extended dance mix in the vein of it a sin or can you forgive her the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl then cd cassette form a cloud in a box is a good b side track with a techno dub feel a la s flavour say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is it is the second best version of all the remixes
0	i am not a fan of the freshly stuff
1	the song is catchy and fun amy winehouse wa a very talented singer exploit and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song
0	the song are great but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back it it a static filled compressed mess and it pretty hard to listen to whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album waiting for the remaster
0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe this just wasnt up to her usual it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger le universal audience also felt like she had the new song they didnt flow and the male vocal did not mix with her disappointing
1	have always loved this song more the than the word it seems to be the only one by gotye that i like though
1	sublime
1	trade good vibration
1	good sung
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some good lyric from the original the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler india message just do not resonate with me on this album she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin back to the middle video and nature in the future
0	disappointing
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice the title track some are lake is the strongest with it narrative of lost young love the band next album cloak and cipher is even
1	this is a great collection of new wave jazz from him one of the greatest it is a classic it raw and contemporaneous his piano skill are amazing get this one you wont be disappointed
0	it always good to see an artist change and try new thing back in jewel did it wa a big deal everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair this while different is just not what i would call jewel at best i found america enjoyable and run u also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me i did give her a second chance and recently bought her cd i must say jewel slowly regaining her musicality also to here that she will be making country cd next it will fit her voice well
1	i alike like the music
1	i can listen to this one over over again
1	although gretchen is a self proclaimed redneck woman this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production the christmas song for example is fertile with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the graeco roman song it attractively honky tonk while still being faithful to the original santa ive been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming it one of my personal favorite the others are good too in fact the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about annoying and cute overall although i love country medicine from time to time sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a spoilt move fortunally the production here hold a solid sense of graeco roman vacation atmosphere with just the right meet of signature gretchen her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well i commit it a solid recommendation
0	and i say that so loosely this song wasnt great the time i heard it and it still sugar coated fluff mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance but this one grate on my nerve copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do not original and we had enough of that song thats what this song totally ride on at least chris even though it a similar beat ha something going for his with you better lyric nice video altogether i just dont appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though come on we heard it enough in second i will never forget youre in everything i do later just like a tattoo ill always have you blah blah blah blah jordin start writing your own song and maybe youll get some star end note beautiful but get a new producer who afraid to try something new and different i know it can be hard original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but and thats a b i g but copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want do the lyric are trite super elementary and nothing i mean nothing besides the vocal work out
0	this album is trash this band completely copy and try to be gun n rose of the era with the leather boot and aviator the lead singer of faster pussy in one video try to be axl in jungle with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelet and leather pant dont buy this imposter junk go get appetite for destruction by gnr and rock out no one can ever be axl the song try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar being bad also the lyric try to be like brett michael of poison and are awful rock on
1	this product is simply a recorded countdown for each second musical interval of exercise and second of rest for a total of cycle
1	it is great i love the completely cd
1	beautifull rendition of this song soul and feeling from this talented young lady a bit slower than the original which showcase jena beautiful vocalization voice
0	everything about this album is just bad from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting it terrible ok let start it with the obvious how do they forget the ya yas version of midnight rambler again hell even the album version would be acceptable that song is undeniably a harlan fisk stone classic in every single sense of the word of honor it wa bad enough to miss it on lick but it omission here is indefensible that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it you could make a full cd of song that dont deserve to be here more than half the third disc is garbage from their risky year of songwriting then some classic that dont very deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem are not fade away have you seen your mother arse around to cry respectable and the last fourth dimension very better song than cant you hear me knocking moonshine mile let it shed blood and all down the line and come on street of love harlem shuffle highwire love is strong anybody seen my baby dont stop over album cut like shake bitch and monkey man i get you wish to have a collection that span their entire career but they should very focus on the aureate year rather than equal fourth dimension allowed for these awful s cut hell i mean even we love you little red cock and heart of stone are bad choice look i know i have a bias i love these boy disregarding whatever category the beatles power fall into they are inarguably the single dandy rock normality roll band of all fourth dimension but even a a major major fan i wouldnt recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the harlan fisk stone i cut down my teeth on this band with lick it wa a good intro to the band or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band it essentially the same story here although they were impudent enough to add she wa hot even though the shine a light version is much better and the killer kick as powerhouse rock off other than that there is no difference between them star for the euphony obviously i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to em insanely absurdly unbelievably great hooey but dont get this album it not worth the price find a friend who love the harlan fisk stone if youre impudent youll have a few and postulate them to make you a mix or get lick used for a couple buck just stay on away from this nonsense no midnight rambler the title grrr a gorilla i give up im kick the bucket to my room and putting on sticky finger
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly vocal are smooth and spellbinding overall a great album
1	great to listen to for my daughter john l h down and the lesson through life also smash mouth get knocked down but i get back up again

0	the book call back grow productive is a must own it is book to be study multiple time that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very drone he doesnt pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second the narrator ha a strong voice it just emotionless it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to study aloud but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming bottomline bargain the book bargain the audio book just skip this one
1	i had a favorite album back in high school entitled the rock album cant seem to locate it anywhere but here on amazon i can piece the album together using itunes voila
0	if you like betty boop and fancy the idea of her singing soft ballad youll love a great deal this stuff me not so much

0	not the same kimbra
1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on one is that we will die another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling vocal performance the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a great call and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doesnt change with the infectious til the end every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a stone cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band need a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up
1	conflagrate i have enjoyed buying music for my kindle because i have found all my oldie but goody sound quality is excellent
0	im a big katherine cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to katherine cornell soundgarden audioslave and totg fan everywhere this should be a justin timbercrap song

0	i wa counting down the day to this album being released i listen to sturgills first two album often and couldnt wait for new stuff so i buy the album on release day and start listening what the heck is this the st track is ok the nirvana cover is absolutely putrid the rest of the album is just boring and generic huge disappointment
0	im sorry but i did not like this cd i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll out and drama queen very unspoiled birdsong but this eternalize cd fell way short musically these kid are very talented and great musician however i thought the song writing wa bad the lyric bad and the vocal music were bad vocal music were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling sarah need to take ownership of the vocal music and put her own signature and personality into them not just take them off the sheet of paper she is unseasoned and i know with some unspoiled instruction and coaching she can develop this talent remember her janis janis joplin cover capsize blue thats what im talking about she need to do more of that this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd somebody need to help them with their songwriting it wa all over the place on this cd im hoping they can work it around but for now im backing off for a while to see where they go from here unspoiled luck you guy
1	great smashing song
0	seth man who broke your heart your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time but still neither is enough to let me sit through song of depression loneliness pining cry in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note but your failed unless are wanting someone to put a gun to head go jump in the river i can not recommend this not even a background dinner music bring back the happy swingin cool seth please
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of holocene epoch in which sound engineer over compress a recording in order to make it sound louder but damaging the dynamic range this ha become known to many a the dreaded intensity state of war it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail remaster of pretty hate machine and subsequent release of classic beatles record the compressing of an album is done for the interest of body god forbid little joey need to act the bulk nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod a note here the normalization function would do this just fine regrettably this is damaging the overall quality of sound the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube and i enjoyed it quite a bit i purchased the candle after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by and wa pleasantly surprised it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case with truly gorgeous album art in a fold on the cover you have the liner note which list the lyric everything package smart is very good and i must order again that the album art at least for me is one of the best that ha come in quite a while but once i ripped it to my pc using eac my ear had bug out to hurt after the sixth song i decided to affirm my notion that the candle had been overly compressed by going on the dynamic range database to my dismay i saw that lonerism ha indeed been impress negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression before i end the review i must posit that this album music smart is absolutely fantastic if not for the miserable mastering i would have easily given the product a i can only trust that in the year to come lonerism will get an actual remaster so that the dynamic will remain integral on the retail release spirit liberate to disagree ask me anything in the comment edit a of holocene epoch i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around it is essentially the same mix without the bulk level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion drum in particular sound much advantageously buy the candle and or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version great album trouble solved the two star still stand though a this is a product review of the candle and not the unmastered mix floating around out there

0	selfies are enough i dont see why an annoying song wa necessary the white voice in this song is unbelievably annoying i want just smash my headphone i mean yes ha a catchy tune but it is not the type of song that you spend money on look up on youtube watch it once and then never discus it again
1	great cd
0	ha joined the like of all the other modern day group what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and like the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike this may be fine for today who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value but for u old classic rock people i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice
0	i love dt i respect them for taking a chance but this album doesnt work for me i suspect that i would enjoy it more if i give it more time but im just not interested in investing the time right now
1	sound clear and no disappointment in quality i am very happy with it and love the information technology song go for it
0	you can buy a cd same price with track on it so if havent got that then dont buy this nokia a the album on download
1	this is a great song that effectively satirizes maudlin garbage like the christmas shoe if your fed up with a steady stream of artificial christmas cheer and need something different this song might be good for you
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version definitely not disappointed with this pressing first off it is select heavy it feel even heavier than gram the mastering also seems pretty good drum are tight and high are bright the saxophone especially shine the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone my favorite part about this gatefold is that while later all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp they werent vinyl group this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side which really minimizes inner groove distortion on my setup the last song louder than word the only with look vocal there did comprise seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my sir thomas more john l h down cartridge alignment a far a the actual music ive only listened through it once so far spoiler alert the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin nigh about rds of the way through the energy throughout is very calm and soothing there comprise are no power rift like are present in then momentary lapse this is more like obscured by cloud there really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio and winnow that is because it one of those album that is obviously simply meant to be listened to a a whole it really hard to tell where one song end and sir thomas more the next begin through almost the whole album overall it nothing spectacular but it a well put together album and very easy on the ear a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day a must have for any big floyd fan or collector i feel i will appreciate it even represent more after additional listening
1	i liked this song when i sung dynasty first heard it on the loud speaker at the gym while i wa working out with weight
0	weak vocal weak instrumental they clearly have lowered the key for several song yet joseph sound like he is straining he sound like he lying on his back with a collapsed lung where is the donny osmond version that i love other version of this soundtrack are star this one is terrible
1	the title say it all really i absolutely adore this song listen to it on you tube and then youll want to buy it too
1	i love jason album
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep non you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire require in the turned fireplace when her voice leaf you assumably asleep for minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect pathetic a the fire in the fireplace fortunately it wa only a cent wasted expenditure there are some good sleep vocalize aid recording available but this is not one of them

0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off i understand it wa a daunting task to roulette wheel make a compilation of this magnitude but come on people by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space to leave track such nigh turned a take it away ballroom dancing tug of war c moon vanilla sky helen wheel bluebird etc off wa just project inexcusable
1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the iodin first year after it came out it wa really good but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then i got this because i had a amazon mp credit awarded for a purchased cd after skimming through a few other artist i remembered this song and picked it up the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic tuner than the original which is a noticeably initiative good thing and i would recommend this track
0	while the arrangement of this cover get star this performance of it get it would get if that were an option if you want to hear the original cover which wa done while giving proper credit where it wa due check out jonathan coulton also purchase the one that is in the style of glee so that the purchase go to a good cause a data hook product link linked class a link normal href baby got back in the style of glee dp b b lrx ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf baby got back in the style of glee a
0	a nice album comprised of track which have already been published under the how the west wa swung series by wr record vol through very little information transpired by the time the album announced for release may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best compilation you have bought wr record series you do not necessarily need this album
0	it a pretty song with majuscule vocal but im not sure about the lyric message once i downloaded and listened to it in it entirety i wa displease sound rather morbid to me not a majuscule choice for a christmas song sure it ha a christmas y sound but if you in truth listen it not about anything to do with christmas is it just me or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy therefore far i in truth enjoyed this twenty four hour of free downloads advent typecast calendar last year i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest it made for a majuscule collection of christmas song arrangement i wa not familiar with this year is disappointing by comparison

0	when i gave this album star at one time after listening to az then listening to this a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch album is a bad a it get first off this bite off everything in his the album title get rich or tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die just longer the only reason why he is because he got shot time and he a fool on stereroids all over the medium and is an annoyment on mtv and anyway on album his lyric are childish and nursery rhyme along a lame horrible flow good beat but putting him on the track made em sound bad he a mile away from being pac and ja rule ha a good chance of beating him if you pop rap odds are you brought and after reading review you hate me but for those who like real hip hop this is garbage is doesnt even to deserve to be called a rapper from queen na az and mobb deep hold true to the queensbridge name it not even worth cent itself it doesnt even deserve to be on the shelf interesting fact this fool dissin ja rule yet he copying jas style i mean he ha a fake gangsta image and club song song and he acually sings song imitating ja rule and also he used pac rhyme on the hail mary remix from tupacs song hail mary and against all odds to dis ja while using tupacs rhyme for exploitation what a joke a discrace and a cancer to hop just like chingy juelz santana he ha good beat but his rhyme are completly senseless ludacris g j kwon bow wow u know who else peace

0	wile im sure it is just right for some folk and i like a lot of cajun zydeco music this one just didnt do it for me i in reality didnt keep it deleted
1	very good album
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t bone burnett an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of nor doe burnett complete the song although he been making his own record since the s rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known burnett wa a relatively early costello producer burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could so what attracted him to the project my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious the serious lyric were more elliptical open and allusive than his previous song the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those arent successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness there wa also a cable film tie in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition no matter each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he a very understated singer compared to the others instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best dylan wa the other tie in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year
1	this brings me back to my younger year my college day when ll wa still my boo ive grown up since then but i still love this song
0	im confused a to corrupt how to listen to doh this track where do i go my review ha nothing to do about rihanna shes great and i love this song thats why i bought it i wa just disappointed when i went to listen to the song and i had no idea where to go why cant it just download straight reexamination to itunes it would have been so much easier
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded virago like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior however the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face away amazon i accidently got individual stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp feature for another musical track honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters
1	ive listened to this album since i wa a kid and each time it take me back forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music i love that it take ancient song we all and put pure soul into them favorite track are the overture every valley lift up your head and he shall purify and of course halleujah all i can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why i christmas and the holiday season

1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song it got so low at time i couldnt really make out the note but i liked most of the song and fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell all well done really enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and the old beatles song if i fell in love with you very listenable and relaxing

0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i dont agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle like the live performance on crossroad and the production quality is not great either you cant really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue
1	when i kickoff heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback robin thicke pharrell and t i definitly hit the nail on the lead with one it reminded me of something youd hear from earth wind and fire i hope these three collaborate again
1	the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing my daughter wa devastated when i told her the news she always wanted to see the band live and this song it wa both our favorite cranberry song the song haunted my dream the night she passed my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang she wa obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her song and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound if youve never heard a cranberry record this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound
0	the problem with slay getting the preview is that they never let you hear the end of song i dont know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album but several of the song have the last comprise note or two cut off either completely or comprise right in the middle of a note not a lot of joy trouble there i will say that there are some song on the album that are fine but getting learn slammed like that really ruin everything ill probably go through the album again and remove these song from my device
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp it is the live version from the chuck berry film hail hail rock n roll it misleading to label it re mastered when it is a different version from the original
0	bought this from virago the song are not in original order that wa on album buy the original if you can much better

0	i would rather insert a ocean urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david rose stripper sounding slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased however the original use string for the main line this us brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent this aint that cut for those who relish soundtrack music this to me is like the hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy album are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling
1	mc flepp roman flepp from liricas analas rap in rumansh sursilvan and graubnden swiss people german i am not a rumansh speaker i will say i am a student of german so i find it really cool whenever i can make out humble bit of the swiss people german i think rumansh is a very lovely musical language very pleasing to the ear and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue the beat are planned really well flepp ha a voice that imho is perfect for his music and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility he operate through a lot of different style from mellow to jazzy very refreshen guest include liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoonful on musica

0	on the whole the album is definitely not in the same league a a good pat boone album however i have found when played at medium level it doe provide measurable relief for hemmoroid suffering
0	i generally like starbombs music for what pious platitude it is and what it root word is is a blend of pop rap video game parody and novelty music a far a those quality go the artist havent deviated from their theme however decent compared to the first starbomb album i felt this wa a huge step down the song just arent a unique comical or lively aside all the same from smash the track are pretty forgettable some of the song make extension reference to the previous album which might seem like a nice touch but i felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever ampere insertion for nostalgia i still bought the album to support egoraptor whose video game review on youtube i love bought i cant really recommend this album otherwise

0	i want to quantify my review up front in my dictionary you face up the word music class brass professional and youll see newmarket anyone who know me know that newmarket is and ha been my favourite group since dirt hand down the only other dance orchestra closer is the beatles i own every album and every standard candle double my key chain of mountain say newmarket my refrigerator and front room access ha newmarket magnet inside and out anything with the newmarket logo on it get saved want more proof of my loyalty this standard candle saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache i didnt say anything when this group started re issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue i figured they earned the right plus they had to eat despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist vocalist peter cetera this group really worked hard both in the studio and at the concert venue to rest a vibrant part of the music scene it is not leisurely to stay current for year and please everyone when the new guy came on the scene you didnt hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding same cetera cetera wa kaput jeff wa in and thats that i didnt ever so expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound same terry kath and frankly i didnt want them to even the drummer tris imboden wa musically right for the fit of this dance orchestra all of them bringing their own piece of continuing newmarket gift into the fold but folk this is not right newmarket ha more gift than this part of me want very hard to salute them for being there for year the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to brook in a cold seattle rain to hear them wreak this music in concert i can hear the same stuff on night and day newmarket and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago i dont know maybe i am just getting to old but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well if you have to have it then buy it if you are hard up for money save it for food or something worthwhile i know my mom said that if i didnt have anything gracious to say then i shouldnt say anything but i am not getting a warm fuzzy tactual sensation hearing this one usually i am stoked and cant wait to tell a quaker i crataegus oxycantha have to displume the shade and bolt the room access and turn off the telephone thank goodness i have other newmarket album to listen to better luck next time fella maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen
0	this is his worse album every the lyric defective suck and his comprise beat suck he claim to be the best but he is not the worse song are theee forth of the disk he should have took time and dud this disk right
0	this is terribly embarrassingly boring i know that phil spector isnt dead yet but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he subjected to this rebel biker jagoff bupkis if you thought wa garage you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for an entire in either case take my advice and head in the opposite direction out of control is nothing more than disney music for cutting set the stuffed toy market most definitely also extends to the suicidal fantasy demographic cotton candy and jelly ha beens oh i buried you today indeed

1	granddaughter love t
1	the song is catchy and fun amy winehouse wa a very talented vocalizer and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song
1	terry kath in his heyday jamming over a funky vamp before transitioning into bobby lamms bluesy ballad loud raw and improvisational gibson s g handiwork make this tune my favorite early chicago piece of work circa
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song first there is the music the song is fairly simply yet build in a mid s era bob dylan style nothing spectacular but that really information technology isnt the point of the song the production is clean with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus comprise to remain on the vocal exactly where is should be the primary focus of the song is in the lyric wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it operating theater while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind such a whats your name what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and ampere early how the day after day life in motel bobsled room can drive a musician to despair i think that at the beginning of the song some other it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life only ha on him and begin clean and jerk how he is willing to say or do anything to bobsled not have to spend another night alone really an accurate view of what the road can do to you bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully but from an entirely different perspective worth the download but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it
1	great
0	i really expected to be blown away by this album it wa one of the best selling record the year it came out and this record cemented lil wayne a one of the biggest rapper on the planet you couldnt turn the tv on without seeing him or this record however there were only or so sung that i liked the other sung just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyric but peradventure the producing distinctly the guy is talented but the record just came crossway a bland and insistent to me his resign with birdman wa slammin i expected this record to sound a little closer to that obviously i am in the minority here a the rest of the world bank get enough of this record
1	this is a great session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson a alright clollection of bebop lay that display excellent communicating between these two giant eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha cha this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat once again great rare music alike this is only available a an import although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith eighteen classic album which i purchased for about im so glad that the market across the pond is ca ca these classic session of jazz available affordable for those who alike timeless music such a this one by jos papa lou who even today blow rophy around those much younger more acclaimed by the critic expert than he

1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly vocal are smooth and hypnotic overall a great agreeably album
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice ive ever heard she is also one of the most under rated songwriter in nigh the country the story wa a rather winnow short lived person group formed back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching sung dynasty melody could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in the advocate sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my romance absolute favorite is comprise a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and bide is a perfect example of her true artistry the multiplication eye in the sky track inwards from one of jonathas on solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas album comprise both solo and from the away story are highly recommended away her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing along with her interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time haunting her song pet stay and play in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just cant imagine why she isnt more popular some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance while some of her song make you want to cry she is that good i dont know what else to say write other than buy her music
1	what an awesome collection of relevant artist on this cd something awing fresh to hear and my favorite bruno mar is featured on one of the track if you dont want roughly to buy it to support the producer artist by making the purchase at least take a few minute to listen to the sample im guessing youll want to download some of the track to add to your personal collection many of them are along that good
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate and his voice is nothing special his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous id have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune a waste of money
0	had forgotten comprise i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ugghhhh other cd this same comment damn since i dont remember them i most likely dont have a copy of the original order where it wa supposed to come from and too late comprise to get the item or be refunded ugghhhh

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraised annoying band in former armed force history the intense praise this band get is downright sickening initiative how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that matter is about a far from being a rock and roll constitute band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toe tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music wa about pathetic entertainment it felt good to listen to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had inwards any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good begin time then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the s stuck in the s well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an s thing bemire to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge make you feel like killing yourself in the s i used to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in inwards i took all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain cd and i burned them range and then i spent the comprise rest of the afternoon grooving to arena angstrom rock grime band and my depression whatever instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first time in year and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it cause depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage roughly stay range away from grunge

0	not a energetic a other version i wa expecting a little bit more might be for background music etc not the song i wa looking for
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low remark of some of the song it got so low at sentence i couldnt rattling make out the remark but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with vizor frisell all well done rattling enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and the old beatles birdcall if i fly in love with you very listenable and very relaxing
0	doe a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not so let drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend if inunct nirvana and kurt cobain were the be all end all of the music scene it wouldnt have continued to evolve regulate wheel spoke comprise much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music select scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in comprise general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say thats what it is thats how easily duped they are when i different see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix bob dylan and john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he been anointed by his overemotional iodin fan and critic alike is king of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine likewise habit a modern musician and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain later she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they support had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution striation for spoiled middle class kid from divorced neer parent to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and no more any form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask what else is there to vista choose from i simply think the youve given in to the medium already opine once teen discover kurt cobain they think that cheesy just because the medium ampere and stuffy bob dylan critic say so that there nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b airless s the beatles john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything musician else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

1	i purchased this album a part of a workshop we pose in my art fraternity gamma xi phi listening to it will help the listener to take a shit the connectedness from the harlem renaissance through the black art movement to the modern era m sanchez present a work that is smart boldface witty and inscrutable this wa my first time hearing her perform a opposed to reading her work in a book a a gay person i must admit i wa select aback by some of the language in one of the poem but i had to realize that this wa recorded during the black art movement a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poet of the time in spite of that language and those idea this is a solid piece of work

1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria periphery and then may just be the next big thing in the metal world the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past angstrom few year the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha record album finally found a niche of it own albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos periphery brings enough fresh idea along with a solid understanding of their root to craft an album well worth owning simply while certainly not for everyone a the screaming can get pretty brutal the quality is high fringe from beginning to end if youre into the deftones then metallic periphery will be right at home in your collection
0	this is only relevant for the vinyl version this is about the piece of plastic itself not the music im a very information technology big panic fan once i saw brendon tweeted about this i preordered it i received it on the day of the release april all good only today i saame got to listen fourth dimension to it it all just a ampere tiny bit too high pitched playing it in sync next to a digital version of the same song you can hear it and even without first time i played it and i swear i simply watched keep an eye on this thing like a hawk and cared for it like it wa my child there a lot of jumping in victorious and dont threaten me with a good time

0	nothing new here except the packaging this collection is the first time capitol building inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album along thats why god made the radio the reason i highlight come out single is because what the heck information technology is a single ahead of time these day although there wa actually a rpm vinyl single issued of thats why god made the radio it wa just issued only for probably collector like me the other new single isnt it time only exists on the album back in the day of top radio we called these album track not single included in this collection is lacklustre yet another same old mono version of good vibration come on guy too isnt it time that a stereo mix officially pamphlet come out most beach boy song were recorded on state of the art for those time recording equipment also included are several more should be stereo fourth dimension mono track do it again surfin spend a penny safari i get around the little girl i once knew help infectious mononucleosis me rhonda fun fun fun and of course good vibration unexplicably missing is their first hit surfin plus many of their biggest hit like be true to your school and of course their holiday season hit also included are some non hit album track listenning to smashing the mono track most sound like early cd tinny and bassy and are definitely not remixed i dont think that brian would ever have okd these without at least re eqing them on the plus side included are black white photo of the beach boy in their younger day pre gray fat and bald each disc come in it own sleeve disc their young day and disc the old fart there also a nice booklet which could easily fit in a in effect jewel case both cd look like mid s swirl label capitol s the sound pine tree state is great and doe offer many of their best song
0	i never ordered or received this why is this listed under my purchase is it just one song dynasty or the whole album
1	a fun song from it time
0	completely different than any of her older album if you same old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit this isnt the album for you
0	alright this song is actually so that i couldnt help myself from writing a review it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a year old most likely did the most annoying part of the song is repeated you dont know that play over and over again to imply the listener didnt hear it the first time the you dont end with a horrible downward due to a very singer dont throw away your money and if it on the radio change the station
0	not really the song generic so disappointing in this purchase
1	beautiful great acoustic great ballad
1	this is a awesome cd full of cruchy guitar dual solo thumping bass and pounding drum everything tou would expect from stryper broad and more
0	the song is listed a keep on smiling but it not what you get when you download it thats suck there is nothing i can do
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review so it going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any review that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thought i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this a a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recording in fact i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that he done that and yet at the same time i think he charged off in many different direction i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some album require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly it the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the track the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with song that are i presume the stripped down sound groban wa hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence a an album i just feel that it trying to be so many different thing and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically even if it sometimes miss the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic sadly it staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fan and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinion jg fan have rightly or wrongly a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread wa sent a a link to many fan and a such it could have an impact on here i think it only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves
0	i enjoyed it more when i wa a year old hipster audio quality wa good i forgot the rant about god though and that wa enough for me to delete it
0	it is a good song but it isnt a spectacular song this song is lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music i love gaga but not this song
1	it information technology is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary buy of simply find it on you tube
0	honestly i hate this song i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it it another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem i respect them and really like some of their stuff ace wa a bos but this is just campy
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse although second album are known to be difficult i beleived the band to have promise how wrong wa i there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face it all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way but there is no melody on this album worth writing about i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did and if you like lifehouse because of no name face trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jimmy eat world even the calling whose album i also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere
0	i ordered this certificate of deposit based on one song i had heard it turn out that is the only good song on it the rest of the certificate of deposit isnt anything i want to heed to what else can i say steer clear

0	according to frontman songwriter ra mcguire problem started when the band wa denied they felt wa well deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp this wa after the label had voiced it approval including consulting with them a to the of promised credit tot wa the last album randy bto ever produced for trooper lawsuit were filed friendship were scuttled and most significantly they went with different producer howard steele of heart fame what that mean to the listener is that the who for year had for them and groomed the overall sonic output and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist songwriter in the business wa now out the door to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion so what doe the first rb produced trooper album sound like well aside from the reasonably solid opener which to the first trooper track id ever heard back when it wa a hit and one of my favorite by the band we get a weakly performed kink cover compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time some cheesy ballad mixed with some filler not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is production credit indeed that this album wa one of their best seller speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product after this one came out they basically had out of the big time a subsequent sale will attest to insult to injury they still ended up paying out randy half his full album sheesh talk about a pyrrhic victory although by s ten they had started to kick some as again this album a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their who doesnt necessarily take any more credit for their s success than ra songwriting but sometimes it what a producer wont let the do thats just a important ya know

0	i had pre oredered this album on itunes and could not wait to get it i first fell in with bright eye when i heard their album im wide awake it morning the gentle yet strong instrument and focus vocal had a large calming effect on me which is why i grew to love bright eye however this denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered most of the song rely heavily on electric instrument and a distorted sound that come a angry instead of thought provoking i would not recommend this to
0	some of you may wish to bribe this chicago album because unwisely corresponding me you want to listen to the music and vocal of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett crush george sir john hawkyns jr marcus hummon who are not in the dance band with only song out of write entirely by a dance band member apparently either the dance band are no longer equal to of making music or the manufacturer intend so if you unwisely corresponding me bribe this album to hear the dance band play you have to listen to downwind thornberg cornet crush matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drumfish john brockman drumfish and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mister jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the dance band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am gladiolus he had some fun but i wa not paid to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal penchant but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i dont mind if i dont corresponding the vocal a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the manufacturer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music only a name to milk river a they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the penchant of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha induce an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the dance band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and represent of all those other musician would somehow be respectable for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable client guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the vocal and he ha not let tris play drumfish on of the vocal this is a caper not sure how mister demarcus can say he is proud of the boy he seem to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the put to work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sorry caper of them on their last album but the dance band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known respectable after a thinking pause of year what to choose to give out out on and what legacy and computer memory to leave as cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable from any out take from any of the record album from to write and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a dance band that exploited to be more than just a steel name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your tum a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the unitary by henry m robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find various piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who induce the vocal and who played them and you will wholly love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some good represent by some people just the assort of vocal you enjoyed on those other record album and good production bribe it and love it

0	after an adequate if a little bland debut record album i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse although second album are known to be unmanageable i beleived the band to have promise how incorrectly wa i there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name case it all highly irritating mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way but there is no melody on this record album deserving writing about i write this to stop others making the same fault i did and if you like lifehouse because of no name case trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band switchfoot vertical horizon jemmy eat world even the calling whose record album i also think bear from having only one good song on it but is still safe than this drivel are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid spend your money and time elsewhere

1	there are actually only a few thing in life we can numerate on ane is that we will die another is that motorhead is operate to release a pulse pounding heavy jam filled album and once again they do not disappoint at all mikkey dee sound amazing and strictly flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry heavy snarling song performance the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a large prognosticate and response section motorhead have always been capable of busting out a large ballad and this doesnt change with the infectious til the end every song is a engrossing and heavy performance by this trio and then we score the grand finale a cover of the rolling pit sympathy for the devil not very many band could pull off a pit cover but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song i wa smiling from ear to ear lemmy doesnt try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming this album is pretty much perfect and this band penury a in the u s so i urge you if you want some talented classic metal in your life pick this album up

0	this is the most overrated overhyped overpraise annoying band in history the intense praise this band get is downright nauseating how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll if you ask me nirvana and any other grunge band for that weigh is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get rock and roll is supposed to be fun catchy toenail tapping fun in the s and s just about all rock music wa about entertainment it felt good to take heed to life wa good but then in along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music and rock wa never really the same again everybody wa miserable nobody had any fun any more if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good fourth dimension then that band wa cheesy and stick by in the s stick by in the s well if making music for entertainment purpose only and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an s weigh to do then the s is where i want to stay grunge spend a penny you feel like killing yourself in the s i use to like grunge and i went through a period of severe depression but in i lease all my nirvana pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chain standard candle and i burned them and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band and my depression instantly disappeared i wa finally happy for the first fourth dimension in class and i owe it all to dump my grunge standard candle i dont recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody grunge is the most depressing music in the world and basically just encourages you to hang yourself it case depression and suicide dont poison your mind with this morbid garbage stay away from grunge
0	what can i say it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe variant of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album apparently there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here what complete jibberish how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary agiotage for the super deluxe version and then not provide all be after mental object for release while id love to say im shocked mr taylor would sanction this it is apparently one of the many new le than desirable trend the record company have espoused lately to get those few of u left who support physical medium to shell out more dough disgusting
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord this compact disc is astoundingly well crafted every note seems perfectly placed the word are wise and beautifully fitted to the music generally this is soft warm lulling music but it doesnt put you to sleep toxic girl is catchy jangly and rhythmic without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it there is a real solace quality here though that cant over be denied fan of low and air should be quite pleased

0	a self inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician i thought not so let drop the charade that kurt is a legend if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be end of the scene it wouldnt have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world look for yourself and try to any contribution he brought to music when you see it in it totality his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence but rock is regressing because cobain the man allowed nu metal and hate rock to be bore from nirvana nirvana had none of the passion drive and true grit that make honest musician stand out nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say thats what it is thats how easily duped they are when i see kurt cobain compared alongside hendrix bob dylan john lennon i find it sickening because cobain a he been anointed by his fan and critic alike is of the slacker he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit a modern and artist ive stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman unlike cobain she truly lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what had been denied kurt cobain just wanted to incite revolution for spoiled middle class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once could kurt cobain honesty do of those thing no when getting into music i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band nirvana pop punk and form of metal especially for younger people getting into the music scene if you read that and ask else is there to choose from i think the youve given in to the medium already once teen discover kurt cobain they think that just because medium and critic say that there nothing beyond him which is a lie i saw bypass him and altogether i recommend tracey chapman the cranberry the b s the john lennon bob dylan the moody blue and anything else experimental or strange nirvana wa just lazy

1	since i grew up in an extremely remote astatine part of alaska i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention in my thirty i had inwards dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a e special concert promoting the bee gee album this is where i came in pine tree state naturally i stayed to watch and almost immediately i pay off wa blown away by the most unique amazing and thrilling voice id ever heard in my life from that moment on i bought every bee gee album pine tree state available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice and what a rewarding journey that iodin wa record album his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do iodin with the incredible instrument that wa his voice obviously the huge album from the seventy didnt interest me much despite their genius early danceability because his voice is not highlighted fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album ive often wondered what robin gibb would have roll in the hay done with his voice if he hadnt been shaped stake by the bee gee often i yearned for something more than the pop song after comprise all his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre this album come answer the closest to proving that just forth listen to dont cry alone if only you dont believe me and while many of the track are once again pop theyre more mature both in lyric and meld in vocal and i love that he us his terrific range from one song to the next i especially love it when he sings in the lower register sanctuary since he doe it so rarely but so well ahead of time naturally turdus migratorius if you love robin gibb or the bee gee youre going answer to buy this album if youre simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of if not the most unique haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice
1	another get out your seat raise your hand and praise god song this song touch the heart and the spirit

0	t c elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge the album and the movie his delivery wa excellent so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark the first single miss thang wa good good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle remember cassette single the rest of the album wa mediocre t c had a fast paced flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa lamentably replaced with a slow choppy style on most of true confession it possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang which explains the song miss thang and cold thang however even with decent sample beat the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog and list the godfather of funk a producer excellent beat and nice hook but the delivery by t c wa anything but funky the title track wa an extension of t c s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album not enough to save the however

0	made in aut in serial playing time this is album from canada aim self register proclaimed metal queen and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album emotional rain her previous album displayed more subdued rock and better comparison polished melody than it predecessor but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre i like la singing and la old p demonstrates taste her talent but everything around that is a great disappointment from the opening note of the first track in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage maybe it wa i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe the instrumentation is basic poorly recorded but mostly pointless it music without melody or purpose and even though some of the arrangement are skirt at time but rarely adequate you wont be captivated by any of it this album wa a off her latest slick chick is a tribute to swing inwards talk about lack of constant direction perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee banker bill previous album since theyll have nothing unknowing to compare it with but if youre somewhat familiar with album like powerline bodyrock announced or metal queen be careful this time try to borrow a copy from someone else skirt first or listen to some song sample this is no traditional lee aaron

0	i have listened to this new record album a dozen or more time now i have gone backrest and listened to his very first record album to his most current i even pulled out the dvd album and impart them a mind a well closer without interrogate is his very best record album the most solid performance from track to track illumination is without interrogate the worst there is no other artist who i mind to more over time than mr groban his song have soothed away many stressful present moment and day his voice is different any other he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer til now this doe not change the fact that this new record album is hand down the worst in some way i wish it wa never been released for it tarnish his previous acquirement i do not blame mr groban for this even though he chose his manufacturer but i do blame his advisor and most of all the manufacturer rick rubin is no david foster even though i am not a personal fan of david foster his arrogance is not very becoming his ability to but in concert solid album and attach song to the mighty performer for the mighty hit is without interrogate impeccable and with this said maybe he deserves to be arrogant mr groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song the best i have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer redirection is needed for the next record album heck if it wa me i would go backrest to the studio apartment rather of go out on tour and put in concert an record album that would be nothing le than his very best many of the standard which mr groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the footing work for such an record album til now there ha to be new material to wreak the record album to a plane that modify the musical stage this is where the experienced writer in the rock bulge and classical venue could wreak work in concert to pull off an record album different any other in the end this is just my opinion among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour let hope he performs only two or ternion song from this record album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous acquirement and those outstanding performance you have added on the way at many of your venue i wanted this record album to be better than any of the previous album my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song without interrogate his voice remains perfect for the mighty material for the next record album this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination i now look forward to his next record album make out full well mr groban ha decade of music til now to wreak to all of u to enjoy
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music so i ordered the album the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment the mastering of this album is unspeakable a number of the song on this album have an over driven torture sound effect when you hear the song live the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance but on the album edition the torture effect is overpowering and absolutely crush the music i ran the album through a live music audio enhancer claesson edward live audio enhancer and it facilitate quite a bit normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open not with song like radioactive the before is scattered and full of clipping which help to explicate why the song sound better on the radio receiver then on your stereoscopic photograph because they have been processed and facilitate not fixed the end result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is
1	listen to it so much had to order another one want to make sure it doesnt wear come out out

0	there are a lot of four or five leading revue locution that if you can get over the drastic exchange in instrumentation this album is just a good or better what if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica if a bluegrass ring switched to trombone and tuba it wouldnt be bluegrass when u decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked thats what this is they didnt just slightly switch the sound of the instrument they dropped the bona fide folk real vocalise instrument keep in mind i hatred hipster and went with what can only be described a a fake vocalise electronic drum set a synthesizer keyboard and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a ring that ha proven that they are anything but untalented doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome yes doe this album have a few ok melody yes if this wa their showtime album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene absolutely not you can defend this disappointing conclusion to completely exchange their signature sound all you want but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool like u did from josue tree to achtung child but like i said before this is like expiration from josue tree to pop they should have learned from u
0	downloaded this thinking it wa something else not my style of music at all be sure to preview before purchasing

0	i didnt realize that i had this song useable to me until i saw it in the list of item that i supposedly bought and then when i read the other review and see out it is a free download i decided to listen to it i listened for about second penetrate it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is yes that is why it is free
0	wow what a load of garbage if you watch the movie the music might make sense a a stand alone experience without the visual side of meat to accompany it the album is an epic fail the cellist dave eggar might be accomplished and all but that doesnt really come across on this album and if youre a fan of amy spike lee or evanescence there nothing to see here amys vocal appear on maybe of the whopping minute the album play for the one song amy wrote for the album crusade the button is easily the effort worst pas over sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot posterior the dj in ibiza it completely out of place on the album a a whole stay clear of this piece of crap

0	i listened to the sample of this recording and wa struck by how overwrought and melodramatic m crowe had made her interpretation i personally can not see this a a song non angstrom non about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss mr cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship mr buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again both of these recording are looking along back from a place of acceptance and once again reflection m voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel register like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over like job she is not willing to accept that her reflectivity suffering is just nor is she willing to curse god and die

0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project i have to admit i wa excited to get my hand on this box set from one of my fav band i not even get through song before i realized what a collection of cutting room floor this crap is david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd to sell this garbage and will probably do well with their past image i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on disc the two song done on the dvd disc which i have not watched yet might be the only good thing about this disc collection the booklet is kind of ok but even that is not worth price you pay if you you must have this i suggest you wait a couple of year and you can get a used copy only played once for very cheap in fact you can mine for dollar lol

1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album malo which i also highly recommend but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and a always with malo there is an ensemble of latin percussion each of six long track provides listening if you can manage to sit still that is many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument certainly every band member giving it their all followed by the lively mama a latin american a you can get somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song im for real say it nicely then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat the tribal sounding chant hela take back to the primitive before the final nine a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you go wrong adding this one to your cd library the musicianship is remarkable i cant praise it enough
0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this new cd set winnow with great anticipation when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and relinquish were very surprised and disappointed although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u simply very cool there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse information technology musical taste but i must say this one wa a bust we never listen to it and had we previewed it would definitely never have simply purchased it

1	great song
1	beautiful male shout you cry
0	horrible annoying sound i disliked this tremendously i kept hoping the sound would change just the same second over and over
1	ive seen it written that great art divide and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs for me this is something decidedly different for the band yet unmistakably dream theater the shift in focus from shredding to melody long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing while it certainly a star effort from the band for my taste it a little samey and i completely get why a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera for me this may be a top effort from them it grows on me with each listen strong star rating from me
1	i love this song and it wasnt available iodin on itunes amazon had it and for cheap
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me west is another great group of song

0	i dont sympathise why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop music scene today he a cut above in the vocal department he doesnt need to do this im not a fan of his song extract and the management he gone in his career with his focus on such a heavy pop music sound instead of rock where he shine in my opinion but i adore him and his bravery he obviously doing what he love and just because it doesnt resonate with me doesnt mean it not worthwhile i just wish hed do more ballad song with deeper lyric and let u hear new adam in all it natural beauty
1	can you wait love this song have been waiting on this cd to semen out for a long time worth the wait

1	i dont intend mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large disunite of excerpt or single movement from various work but i bought this for my child and it really is an entertaining first rate diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart utter for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music or child who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background
0	would it kill amazon to get the original version of this song this remix is pure dreck avoid like the plague
0	it totaly amazing that this wa created what make sindel think that horrid classical march will sound better when played very badly i might add on electric guitar the tone he us are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window this is totaly unlistenable fountainhead garbage that ha no merrit whatsoever this might well be iodin the worst cd ive ever bought i hope this will be the total extent spue of sindels musical offering putrid

1	beautiful lyric easy listening
0	couldnt become it off fast enough
0	first of all let start out by saying that while ive been a huge of the band since the earliest day im not one of classic chicago fan who hate the s stuff in fact chicago is one of favorite album by the and is an album that they have every right to be very proud of and while and were just cranking out the formula album for them that point they at least had some huge hit single which wa really all the band wa about at that point by the time they got to in both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa should have it for the that period of the band they then spent the next year various compilation live and christmas album some of which were part of the canon and some not so that we could get to the point in where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx i like a lot of fan were very curious to see what this new album would bring a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the sound a even if completely coincidental use of triple hinted a something edgy they inexplicably tried to revive the s sound of the band i say inexplicable because not only doe large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band but even if they could have come up with another the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in there could have been another hard to say im on this record but radio wouldnt have played anyway so even attempt to go down that path who they trying to reach with this album and worst of all the attempt failed there isnt much at all to recommend on this album for of anyone song weak and arrangement and production is tired one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in first place it doe serve to make album like xiv and seem so bad in retrospect though what chicago need to do what almost all of their fan would like to see is a return experimental and jazz rooted sound of the earliest stuff sure lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly tune in an interesting manner and let be honest even a lot of the material on early record werent great song but arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album or maybe they dont want to which is fine but then it probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album
1	love it
1	it doe not disappoint at all not even a little sting im beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong brilliant
0	absorb suck
0	it unfortunate that there isnt a negative rating scale the phonograph recording took v week to arrive both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging recycled the day it arrived
0	there were only a few song i liked not simply what i expected
1	get laid this song
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash ha everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to interpret

1	just like the
0	which isnt saying much since sound out i got comprise this a a freebie since this wa free i decided to download it for kick sanjaya relinquish started off with promise but only got worse a the sung dynasty song progressed in reality while his diction wa good hence the extra star rating it still didnt make up for his breathy voice or his pitchiness going either sharp or flat usually flat and i still have no real idea what the song wa all about actually im rather glad i got this a a free download at least ill know not to waste my money on the entire album
1	merriment love this cd a great mix of fun and serious ballad
0	although a nice album musically these mp track i downloaded were of poor quality probably recorded from old vinyl record track had click and pop while some had actual hiss and skip i know there are quality album out there because i have one of

0	not that bad of a tribute cd but a for myself id really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album if youre a major and i do mean major floyd nut you may get more out of this cd than i did the track the great gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy the woman vocalist just go on and on to put it another way the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band tune like speak to me brain damage and eclipse are okay at best
0	sound like rap and fathom i dont care a bit for it
0	this is not the theme from enterprise this is the same song where my heart take me that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this from the encore cd is not same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual from the enterprise tv series

1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best live show this show is special for quite a few reason one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer tour this release is the nd night of a two night run if you were a member of the warehouse you could have gotten both night anyways this show is incredible for those who complained about the last release sound issue live in new york this release sound amazing and on a side note i could not really hear any problem with the new york release but i digress the show start with an explosive you might die trying a great way to start thing off dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fan dave doe a partial good good time a nice surprise for the fan that go straight into yet another incredible and like every fan know dave and the band always re invent the song there is so much energy in this show it really feel like youre there in the crowd after the incredible two step dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop if youre a fan just buy because you know it good if youre new still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live dave and the boy still prove that after year they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best and if youre lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer im sure itll be the concert of a lifetime
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system iodin after trying it a few more time i front realized it wa actually the production hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice but that wasnt allowed to come through the second song edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing meld along in the background the leontopodium alpinum piano virtually drowned out her voice this wa also the case in along other song but edelweiss is the worst example whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company
0	a a fan of tso we were looking forward to this new cd set with great anticipation when it arrived we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and frustrated although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso this concept left u very cool down there is very little that is musical and a lot of it seems like just so much noise we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste but i must say this one wa a bust we never listen to it and had we preview it would definitely never have purchase it
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i didnt do my research give this album a because it ha a couple new track but there are only and most are from free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which ha track and is a lot better it ha good track flow great production and basically professionally put just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity

0	to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software i wa trying to figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection doing so or ever of very generic song no redeeming quality me sound like just about everything else out there
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the s and s while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this vauntingly band incarnation woody brought a pretty in good order band along a advantageously even though he wa entering the last decade of his life amazing guy amazing edition of la fiesta starting with that electric pianissimo that wa everywhere at the time were they all rolands and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle shrieking trumpet a nifty tiberi solo and awesome dynamic a good a edition a you will find anywhere
1	a beautiful song a hymn of earlier day and who better to do it than fernando ortega the before one star reexamination review really shouldnt be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose but rather an accident on someone part this song deserves star
1	i fell in love with ann wilson the first time i heard arduous dreamboat annie iodin year later ann wilson sound even better wether you are a heart fan or have never heard the group before this is a must have album if you love hard driving rock and roll
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd she promised a come back to her earlier work but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a low budget movie i love the thalia that u amarillo azul en la intimidad love saliva sudor sangre too bad she had to emilio estefan and then everything changed she left her record label sign up with emi and they changed her to latina bombshell every single efort from emi is wierd i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound like en y yo en la fiesta mando yo la loca what a waste of song for cry out loud the only one thats good and the only reason gave her star is no me enseaste that reminds of the cd mundo cristal but the rest if bad really bad besides the fact that hired estefano to work with her i wa expecting a very new sound very cool taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her paulina but no guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there and also i agree with the one who said that she need to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover that will save her some embarrasment

1	this isnt the princess music youd likely expect it better than that it is world guitar music it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm i didnt give it star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling this is fine to listen to when youre awake but arent a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep i skip those song the others are great i loved the price on this and it wa definitely worth it

0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it the detail that count when it came to the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot in the winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known where he no incident like that is found in the entire little house series if you are just for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking
0	this is a very average song and cook scream in some shoe instead of singing hard to believe that chris cornell wrote it

0	quality is ify
0	i really to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out i bought it and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song for a total of on this version im very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed i have to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out the track become monotonous because the production is and the lyric sappy and preachy the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album sadly this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the instead of a strong punctuating beat to accompany some lyric from the the new version slows to crawl and never the momentum of the original the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler india message just do not with me on this album she actually more mature and realistic on her first album while this album is very idealistic and overly positive hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin back to middle video and nature in future
0	just ok

0	ive been a dylan sport fan from way back and im also a expectant sinatra sport fan i write this review from that perspective what ha happened to american culture that a piece of unmitigated garbage ilk this cd is getting such praise from reviewer are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellency anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an deficient knowledge of sinatra and how he did these song and im tired of performer who have no voice at all getting by because they are supposedly emoting frankly this cd is strictly emperor new clothes to put it bluntly it is awful no affair what critic with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra are saying and no dylan doe not make these song his own such rationalization for lousy singing dylan ha taken some of sinatra best im a fool to want you where are you why try to change me now and trivialized them not recommended for dylan devotee and surely not recommended for sinatra devotee
0	i cant figure out why this song wa inwards so popular in the first place only thing i can tell you is stay away from this one worst song in the s period
1	this is my favorite mark knopfler song i cant say it typical but it soooo beautiful horny travis also recorded it but i prefer mks version
1	i mean seriously if you dont know and love this song you either shouldnt be listening to the door or something is wrong with you i know it college music these day but all the
0	when it ha came down to rihanna she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly away kanye west hasnt been musically better with his frill from marrying kardashian to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy winning album of the year now for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney the question have they have better in their art well the answer is absolutely no kanye showed it badly only now with fourfive the two of them do not ignite in the heart instead shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice and in chemistry with sir paul overall i wasnt even impressed with the song and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan i would sincerely pas this one up because four and five second feel more like wasted time overall song f
1	beautiful

1	shinedown being shinedown at their best similar yet very different from all their other tender keep it up gentleman
0	it did nothing for me i lost not one pound
0	this is him singing a a younger artist still havent been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song still an awesome and tear jerking song though
1	this is the rest song in the world
1	the unique voice of bonnie tyler combined with the emotional presentation of the song lyric combine to make this a timeless and classic favorite
1	okay after using that annoying pun allow me to elaborate a little bit lee yuen kam greenwood is one hell of a performer i have to admit this is the first album of his ive bought and no in case youre wondering the inclusion of god bless the united state army had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd it didnt hurt thing though badly get right to the album save yall any more small talk i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting after all united state army is a superbly written song i wasnt expecting these silken number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter thats the bad thing the sound thing is greenwood voice is rich and pure he get hold of these birdcall absolutely nonmeaningful and footling in the hand of any other singer and turn them into something memorable most of em deal with love of course it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery at least from a man perspective rock that you pious platitude move is about getting on with life through the hardship round here get hold of a look at small town and the novel excellent emotional version of god bless the united state army is a patriotic and moving a ever lee yuen kam greenwood isnt trying anything novel here this is territorial dominion thats been traversed before to be sure but his voice is unique his sense of time and style is un matched aside from the excess picture taking not badly done but unnecessary this album is a musical gem it may not be stronger than time but it definitely the album of the moment so to continue on with the cliche seize the moment and on with it lee yuen kam greenwood stronger than time
0	im not sure if i like it or not i finally non listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following song trust in you enough empty me i wait for the lord and revive me not even the chainsmokers weird the cd case and the criminal record artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers bouquet none of the music is chainsmokers again uncanny weird

1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july at age his legion of fan simply refused to let go from that point to no le than of his rca single release would make the country chart seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot not even the late great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had country hit single between and of which crossed over to the hot six to the adult contemporary chart which didnt begin until and one to the r b chart never mind the hundred of equally wonderful selection from his many eps and lp all in all however id say he did a fairly credible job augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and three more photo of jim including one with wife mary at an award ceremony a partial discography of the content is also included but without any chart detail all but track recorded in and included on an early lp were hit for jim of them pop crossover only track made only the country list going to early in his version of the old standard i love you because wa recorded in and wa first released on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and in became a country hit a a single note too that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in and released on rca victor going to country hot a the flipside of i missed me country hot and not included here the first version done in country remains a bit difficult to find the earliest hit represented here and the one that lead off the disc is four wall country for eight week in which wa his initial pop crossover however this came after country hit beginning in with mexican joe for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o ranch boy so i tend to agree with another reviewer who say that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd not counting the first six five of which were for the abbott label and one i love you a duet with ginny wright on the fabor label there were seven rca cut to choose from the best of these included the afore mentioned am i losing you a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart both s still it hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum star
0	saw them perform on a mouth show and thought i might like them oh well

0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut this is a bluesy brassy ala david prove stripper vocalise slow paced arrangement some of you will like it i am biased all the same the original use string section for the main line this manipulation brass and brass for the aside or counterpoint it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave decided accent this aint that cut for those who flavor soundtrack music this to me is like the victor marie hugo montenegro version arrangement of the man from uncle theme i dont even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme i like jerry goldsmith original version everything else is pale the i spy record album are available but at thats out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set which is a lovely accordion and string based song this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling

1	this cd is hilarious i admit there are some song that arent really funny but there always or bad witticism song on an operating theater album in this one the bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song also if you are easily offended by swearing raciest remark dont worry it always in the interest well of humor and always is funny so if you are raceway so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then dont buy comprise this but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my home i know operating theater this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	usually when see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r b in for some treasure this is not one of those kind of cd the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded poorly performed and lacking in appealing hook this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost

1	lovely cd calming and relaxing music
0	no this is not another ive been a lover of lucinda since this or that record usually wheel on a gravel road which everyone seems to worship and i wa really so disappointed because she a mumble b slur or c isnt a good a she wa on car wheel true ive always liked lucinda in a world of boy band and shallow pop euphony shes been a constant factor not always brilliant but always dear and sincere furnish a steady current of decent album in the borderland between commonwealth blue and rock her life hasnt always been easygoing which is reflected in her voice in this her latest release i feel that everything go wrong it a double cd only track on each record most of them way too long a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disk out of it sure she mumble but thats not really the main problem she ha always mutter all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and firm it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to break up up all the word what make this album such a pain to listen to is the euphony itself the complete want of new tune to be honest i feel ive heard it all before in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song door of heaven i bed all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember and the final track faith and grace is just a minute close up session gone horribly wrong there eve a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite right rock ballad some review praise her wakeless which is stripped down and pretty canonical to me it sound apartment uninterested and stale a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root euphony it the wakeless of old beer pall muscle and autumn rain it the wakeless of indifference could have been mark knopfler could have been leonard cohen could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to buzz off set with the job ha lucinda finally lost it have all the yr of boozing and shorting finally taken it cost this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong something she find strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it i liked her previous album where she had more than enough song to make it a double i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel although i might be accused of profanation for saying so and in a world where good and pilot songwriter are few and far between i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her this one however wa just a big yawn to me
1	her voice is awesome she could sing the worst song ever and make it sound like silk
0	when i comprise first played this operating theater cd i thought non to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group not sure what this is supposed to mean but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to vocalize dont waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else
1	my own personal misgiving with this album listening and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel is that in my book little girl cant be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience not that id want an album of tune about and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale but when a barely teenaged kid sings word love in any context other than discussion of stuffed animal collection i get a bit of the jeebies
0	it skipped many time i wa given a full refund
0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim after i came across it while looking for another music title i remember hearing other similar flowing water creek soundtrack and thought that this would be similar but operating theater wa disappointed i thought that this recording seemed fake a if made by a synthesizer or in a bathroom decision the track also seemed to be a second recording on a continuous loop like you raceway i base my purchase decision on the experience of others along if you liked my review or felt that it wa helpful to you then pine tree state please let me know by spend a penny clicking yes below i would also be happy to answer any question that you may have about this product thanks my review are real and typically based on later week of actual product usage my opinion are not copied from other review and are from my own personal experience
1	i will always love forever door down
0	ive been a jewel rooter for a long long time i saw jewel before she became famous for piece of you and instantly fell in love i loved her style her voice her word everything while piece of you will always be my favorite record album i allay found solice in all the others until now what wa she thinking i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar speaking to the push with her song her concert were intimate when spirit came out she added a band to her act and while i wasnt thrilled i could deal with it because at least she wa allay written material those deep word that made me shiver at time then about mo ago i went to see jewel play and i wa so happy to see that she had ditched the band and wa back to playing with just her and her guitar so now mo by and by i fear that girl is gone completely i neer thought jewel would sell out and write such bland on the surface word and pimp herself to an audience that love the poppy nonmeaningful song of britney spear at first when i saw the video for suspicion i couldnt believe it wa jewel then i thought well this birdsong look to be putting down those who sell out so i thought that maybe this birdsong wa the only one of it kind on the record album but it wasnt with the birdsong suspicion jewel is a hyprocrit because she ha sold herself to just hard cash in
1	first class
0	ok
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i didnt do my research i give this album a because it ha a couple new track but there are only and most are from his free mixtape you can get his mixtape so far gone for free online which ha track and is a lot better it ha good track flow great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity
1	i love how her music let you create your own imaginative scenario or remember special thing sometimes no word are necessary and her music allows you to go to a quiet place and not be distracted by lyric and allows you to be with your own thought
0	this not the theme from enterprise this is the same song where my heart will take that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series

0	this album just didnt do it for me i got it when it came out because i have all their cd and love them to death it too girly and poppy for me high pitched the lyric are not all that clear and dont mesh well unitedly to beggarly one thing most of all the melody of the song are hard to heed to you know how some song are just difficult for the ear to enjoy these song are fine most of the time but then near all of them have a difficult spot where the melody or the singing is difficult to heed to there are a few really pleasurable feeling filled song though control secret and sleepwalking start out star from me the rest start out about star i cant relate to them often and i dont start out often pleasure from listening to them but i will always love tbms one time stuff and their newer hide and seek album
1	wonderful
1	smashing great
0	if you are looking for with his acoustic guitar and no band this cd is for you it remind you of tom which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it though i listened springsteen for twenty year i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work if you like busa etc you will not like this cd some of this material could have been interesting had been recorded a rock song i gave the cd two star because it wa made springsteen
0	acck michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with run and hide it sound like sorta like weird whistling if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o k album i rated it star because there wa no star all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible i think the person that is sawing or whatever made good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad if youre wondering this cd wa free at michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent the one we paid for were very good though i guess i found out the purpose of free cd
1	this is a very good album saw him perform some of these song at sacramento ca in

1	love this version of tu amor mi amor by formula five use to listen when growing my mom love the song good time
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there they caught most people with their bombastic overly stylish music they also made a lot of enemy making their direction style over substance music musically their style ha not changed much but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there the alter lyric come off citizenry a weird in record album a bad way and stupid plus the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the striation song at hold out all the illusion and wit wa better than nothing plain stupidity and while this album may be slightly deeper it is defective not an improvement i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that his voice is like to a fault a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam rock band to something deeper and flower is nix one of the main problem i would hate to see him live in doing this they have not improved their music sung dynasty and have lost fan fyi i wa not in love with their first album so this ha nothing to with expectation and i did not hate their last album so i am not solely a killer then basher overall i pronounce the killer dead wait it seem some still think the are the best thing ever you know you are in love if you like flower voice p ampere s while the song when you deepness were young is only pretty good it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid
1	cripple creek by harvey thomas reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing
1	arrant
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need it for exampl e because of violent behaviour and experimental condition like eating disorder a sodding and utter waste of money and time this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence but will certainly line the air pocket of daniel goleman dont waste your money on this no help whatsover book
1	i just watched the blu ray of the movie woodstock it ha the csn y version at end of the movie but get a separate credit for writing the song
1	be intimate it
0	see jewel cross over from her folk country root to pop laced with heavy beat and keyboard this album fails to ignite and feel labored and whereas jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any on the love jewel failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me a disappointing overall i think that she will look back on this one with regret
0	ok relaxation music but it just doesnt do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performance of this song this guy ha real magic to him his affect on the audience reminds a lot of jim morrison he will make eye with just one person and for just a moment but you can tell that that person isnt likely to forget that moment

1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr and i loved it it classic shoegaze with a current sensibility with melodic groove and even mind catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal best track is dig but listen to the whole album from foggy start to finish a intended it a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape

1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore based quartet this a real using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic school type soul voice ive heard this year these are all original song too the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy and it is consistently good listening from start to finish i do have favourite though including the opener never leave you lonely hope high breathe love maybe im not the man evil woman which im sure us the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country though this is not acknowledged they dont know time stop heartfelt balladry at it best and the funky closer it aint over this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group isnt being hailed from the rooftop i will never know i would never have heard of them if not for a uk based black music monthly magazine if you like soul like it wa made back in the day you will probably love this get a copy while you can
0	let me say first im a big james taylor fan but this cd just suck the music is great a usual but the lyric will lose you there are two song on this cd that are ok but just ok they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again the rest of the lyric are just hogwash they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all erg ay caramba one note samba la la la la bamba or jolly springtime oh the jolly springtime in the merry month of may oh the heavenly hour oh the come again day or the bird is on the wing the bell is about to ring the big girl shes about to sing today today today the opening song today today today is a horribly conceived song infantile rhyming pattern melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore i dont know but i had to listen to this cd time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about
1	love casting crown their song always speak to my heart always uplifting one of their best song forever yet like to hear more

0	there is only one song on this cd worth listening to i recoment getting the mp version of tarzan boy iodin and ignore the rest of the song
0	im a big van halen fan but live album is a lttle too late dave dave dave wassup he had it together for the initial reunion tour but to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric but rather talking and mumbling his way through them although not he still the chop if he chooses to use them his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama show he can do better but let spread some of the blame around it been a long time since i heard any live album recorded mixed this badly i swear it sound like an audience shot vid with the sound ripped off it it just atrocious everything is just muddled together and blurry sounding im aware live is live what no mixing board at that venue no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio im really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording a bad a the finally result i think it may have way better with decent recording mixing after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit i think this wa just slapped together with little effort just to get something there sloppy effort by involved im still looking for good quality sound video recording of the initial reunion tour this one aint gon na cut it sorry
1	for what it is it is a great tune sung by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic brilliant

1	great time to have this a an anthem i change the lyric to dancing through the wire iodin b c i am champion sorry katie but thats what it felt like to me i had to dance experience through wire to be with her dangerous and not a good thing to do
1	if you have watched the tv show then you already get it on how catchy the song are the only difference between tv and the cd is probably length i havent actually verified this but it look some of the song on the cd are longer and referable to time constraint they shortened them on the show either way a good time with good music

1	it wa what i wa after
1	neat item just what i needed
1	love information technology it
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton crossroad video and then being unfamiliar with the band went through the review here to try to find the best album i dont agree that this is or star material or performance the song except for the mostly instrumental one are rather ordinary and even those dont sizzle the like the populate performance on crossroad and the production quality is not great either you jargon really hear him pit his voice to the guitar when he doe that after two run throughs this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to great player but mediocre songwriter in all likelihood explains lack of more widespread popularity and act at smaller venue
1	this is spontaneously inspired piano music that evokes wonderful memory and stir up the dreamer in the listener the whole project fingerpaintings serenity is like peace on a disc
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip without having any knowledge that there a spoken word ending that contains a racial slur the spoken word portion ha a good point that wishing i answer warn agree with overall but it render this song unplayable in my household i wish i could return an mp im utterly utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive talk warning i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety
1	i love this tune it my fav dance tune off all time this tune should always be remebered and should be air loved forever
1	critic have called this the best soul album ever theyre right this is the best non greatest soul album one can buy outstanding singing precision producing make this a cant miss album the album look like a greatest hit package with ghetto child one of kind love affair how could i let you get away ill be around others the first track just cant get you of my mind get you going and you wont be able to turn it off
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample distribution very good i enjoyed most every song except take by the wind when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier a if id heard it before i listened a few more time and yes i had heard it before it a reworked version of yannis on sacred mash from his if i could tell you album i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song but not only that farish also introduce the same clip of child laughing that amethystium use in their song avalon from their odonata album whats up with that unless there good explanation for this copying the song take by the wind ha ruin ryan farish for me
0	the strain is not the type of strain i like the strain lack of energy i think it is not fun to sing too
0	the book think grow rich is a must own it is book to be read multiple time that being said the particular lecturer of this audio book is very drone he doesnt pause at the end of time or even a paragraph you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second the narrator ha a strong voice it just emotionless it reminded me of when a instructor would call on a student to read aloud but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a promptly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming bottomline buy the book buy the audio book just skip this one
0	this review is only for this version of the album the remastered expanded edition the mastering sound overly compressed and eddy vocal dont sound loud enough the instrument sound way too and it drowns out on some of the track it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album people are paying money to buy a newer and crappier version of same album save your money and buy the original edition instead the bonus song are great but the remastering wa entirely pointless
0	would not let me play the exception

1	i decided to buy this mp download after hearing too close ampere on different commercial and researching alex clare he an interesting individual person with a unique soulful voice and i figured that closely this album would not disappoint this ha been one of the best album that ive ever purchased to date every song is different but exceptional too especially hand are clever hummingbird us a heart beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat with a pop like upbeat chorus whereas up all night is metre a rock anthem to evening activity there something no this album cd for every individual and even out if you purchase this download at which is a steal you will not be disappointed later i promise
0	after foggy download it wa fuzzy and distorted
0	it a typical contemporary song it make a great high school reunion song for me it john mayer debut song you will know what all this time wa for indicates his confidence in his song
0	i had no idea what they like once i downloaded this song i thought what a waste of time dont bother unless youre a fan im certainly not in any danger of one anytime soon
0	please stop playing this song a hold music is your goal to get me to hang up
0	i expected to get the song i heard on youtube not this one with half of the lyric poem deleted not what i wanted at all

1	i really liked this record album when it first came out one of the sung wa even featured on starsky and hutch dont give up on u baby wa a great go to song for partner off and i really liked the rest of the sung a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor it hard to explicate each song can hold it own even though david soul is best known a an actor conductor he did a great job with playing to an audience of one i dont believe you will be disappointed with this selection
1	this sung dynasty song brings back memory of my teenage year i love most of their music anyway they sure can sing
1	good in effect song
1	this song is truly inspiring i first heard it during a worship session at a church i wa visiting i quickly found it on amazon
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers back when she first released this album i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop sure the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented but if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book it the detail that really count when it came to the music i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book for example laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter instead of using the lyric provided however desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush by the same token her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa when he came home from running around town and she hadnt known where he wa no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song this album will fit the bill nicely if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew a she knew it keep looking
1	i perfect feel good summer stark jam
0	this guy is terrific however this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content every song on one is on the other in the exact order and i bought both thinking theyd be different really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title great performer probably a decent guy but let take one of those off the market it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky

1	great song ive always liked crow so thats no surprise youd think but believe me i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k pax it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man a classic unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack it just the score so look elsewhere for this great song trust me you wont be disappointed

1	i purchased this album a part of a workshop we presented in my art fraternity gamma xi phi listening to it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black art movement to the modern era m sanchez present a work that is smart bold witty and deep this wa my first time hearing her perform a opposed to reading her work in a book a a gay person i must admit i wa taken aback by some of the language in one of the poem but i had to realize that this wa recorded during the black art movement a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poet of the time in spite of that language and those idea this is a solid piece of work

0	i listened to the preview and i find it kind of annoying that this is even listed with all of these musical piece
0	some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because foolishly like me you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago but you get to listen to the composition of dannay orton blair daly greg barnbill dennis matkosky chas sandford jay demarcus brett james george hawkins jr marcus hummon who are not in the band with only song out of written entirely by a band member apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so if you foolishly like me buy this album to hear the band play you have to listen to lee thornberg trumpet james matchack keyboard jay demarcus keyboard tom bukovac guitar dan huff guitar dean deleo guitar yankton mingua guitar jack kincade guitar jay demarcus guitar steve brewster drum john brockman drum and listen to the vocal of shelly fairchild rascal flatts gary levox jay demarcus joe don roony bobby kimball joseph williams so in the eye of mr jay demarcus the producer of this album allegedly by chicago additional musician and song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were in his eye incapable of doing jay demarcus himself ha played guitar and key a well a treating u to some singing i am glad he had some fun but i wa not paying to hear him and his other friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago if i had wanted to listen to all those other people i would have asked for their name in the shop not ask for chicago is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a chicago cd i am not referring to the quality of music here which is purely a matter of personal taste but good or bad i wanted to listen to chicago i dont mind if i dont like the song a long a it is their music but apparently in the eye of the producer and financier of this album there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music only a name to milk a they did with chicago and but far worse this time i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it i do however mean to offend that faithless producer jay demarcus who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision and ha offended the band by showing clearly that a their producer he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable guest guitarist he ha not let keith play on at least of the song and he ha not let tris play drum on of the song this is a joke not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of others if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album but the band themselves whom i had continued to love for decade should have known better after a thinking pause of year what to choose to go out on and what legacy and memory to leave behind cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this a bunch of the usual type ballad indistinguishable from any out take from any of the album from to written and performed in great part by others is an unworthy epitaph for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under conclusion if you are a fan of the chicago to entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning if you are a fan of the chicago to you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy such a the one by robert borrow it from a friend for a listen if you are a fan of the chicago to you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much worth buying for occasional listening if you are a fan of chicago to you are not going to care who made the song and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album which is more of the same it ha some good playing by some people just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album and good production buy it and love it
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade at least elvis wa able to produce some brilliance in this area like blue christmas this is tweedily dumb
0	i downloaded this mp after hearing it in an at t commercial i like the song but the mp sound absolutely awful it just way too compressed so it extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range almost unlistenable i honestly dont think you can blame a lot of this on the mp encoding k is a perfectly respectable bit rate and i have plenty of mp s that sound fine with lesser bit rate
0	i dont know where else to complain about this but every this song on i cringe die a little inside it got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time aside from the fact the song consists of line of lyric with no substance they borrow can can song and make even more irritating

1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice ive ever heard she is also one of the iodin most under rated songwriter in the country the story wa a rather short lived person group formed inwards back in the early s that included jennifer kimball the comprise harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were are inspired and at time their heart wrenching melody pop could bring you to tear my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine from story angel in the house and eye in raceway associate in nursing the sky from jonatha brooke back in the circus so much mine my absolute favorite is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician the singing by jonatha medicine is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project release back in i am also a big fan of that band all of jonathas album both solo and from the story are highly recommended her voice would melt even the hardest extremely of heart and her song writing along with her totally interpretation of other artist song is inspiring and at time haunting arduous her song stay and extremely play in your head for too a long time and when you consider her body of work a a whole i just away cant imagine why she isnt more popular some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance information technology while some of her song make you want to cry she is that good i dont know what else to say write other than buy her music

0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol i had heard this song on the radio probably too much and determine to download today base on a snippet i heard today i have to say i like the song but the ending is really of course now given the whole chris brown affair it make me feel disgusted about him in general but really this song is a wacky love song and the ending is nothing but them yelling out random chord and overly emotional note of hand that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to try out they have singing ability and it seems to go along tooooo long i know you can both sing modern day air supply blech but might appeal to a lot of people just not me just my opinion

0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim after i came across it while looking for another music title i remember hearing other similar flowing water creek soundtrack and thought that this would be similar but wa disappointed i thought that this recording seemed fake a if made by a synthesizer or in a bathroom the track also seemed to be a second recording on a continuous loop like you i base my purchase decision on the experience of others if you liked my review or felt that it wa helpful to you then please let me know by clicking yes below i would also be happy to answer any question that you may have about this product thanks my review are real and typically based on week of actual product usage my opinion are not copied from other review and are from my own personal experience
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r b music scream and emergency are of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to conclusion and jam tank music in the past ha invariably been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd the great thing is he didnt try to conform to some of the newfangled antic with his sound he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate for the lady tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u lol
1	love love love this song

0	most song on this album are too nigh similar i only enjoyed song not the best album ive bought in a while i do like sinach and wa quite disappointed with this one
1	mc flepp roman flepp from liricas analas rap in romansh sursilvan and graubnden swiss german i am not a romansh speaker i will say i am a student of german so i find it really cool whenever i can make out small bit of the swiss german i think romansh is a very lovely musical language very pleasing to the ear and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue the beat are planned well flepp ha a that is perfect for his music and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility he go through a lot of different style from mellow to jazzy very guest include liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoon on musica
1	air return with love their best work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album often delving amongst wall of sound do the joy and synth driven scope be a bee alternatively the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop tune to date with babble out sang sung with this type of line notable from quite an early stage on the album one ha to expect some surprise along the way do the joy an odd track to start the album with nonetheless a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel the sung dynasty sound like something from cycle legend with it multi layered synth forefront and perverted vox effect not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least love once again not your distinctive second sung dynasty it hold a sense of simplicity though and a the sung dynasty progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice soft like piece with a great chord progression and strain the glockenspiel contribute an amazing feel sound like something youd get a line at the end of moon safari especially the later one half of the piece it wasnt my favourite at first but after a few listens it grew on me so light is her football the first sung dynasty to really feature lyrical dynamic the music sound pocket symphony epoch with the sung dynasty being driven by piano and hovering string i heard or study someplace that this will be the second single off the album an odd determination i believe but who recognise maybe it need more listens the sung dynasty seems a piffling bland at some point but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view be a bee definitely not a sung dynasty youd think air would produce with it western like feel the sung dynasty sound like something off a surfing documentary film it fun but also lack specialisation on all front it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest sung dynasty on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this stage right missing the light of the day an interesting tune with some rather unique sound if youve ever seen air live youd eff what im talking about they seem to produce some pretty funky maculation throughout their set and this sung dynasty is a pretty good indicator of that if youve heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo alternatuve twist nothing too exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the album longest tune and one of the best in my opinion contrary to what ive mention so far with affect to lyrical absence ive eer been one to fancy air instrumental track i believe it ask a higher level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that live up to your audience depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamic presence the sung dynasty sound like two turned into one the first one half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau evocative of something off talkie walkie heaven light definitely one of the album standout track itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la probably the album most chill out number with it swirling progression especially towards the middle one half and heavenly vocal scene my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfective tense ambient tune dark huntsman another instrumental track with a great beat to it cross the electronica soundscapes of cycle legend and add the piano driven feel of the majority of pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great summation to the second one half of the album and an homage to the lighter slope of air babble out sang sung well what can we say about this easily air most accessible pop sung dynasty to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album this number is easily one of the best on the entire album simple yet so effective in it livery there just enough line between chorus verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel if youre sound to get somebody into this album nay air themselves this might be a good starting point eat my beat one of the shortest on the album the sung dynasty is a good break from the ambient instrumental driven latter one half of the album with it brewing crescendo mid day through the piece it introduces an amazing piffling synth strain line which is bound to engage further interest you can tell it to everybody an amazing chill out track to begin the closing stage of the album once again i find myself being reminded of the later one half of moon safari with this one modern star in the flip chanson pour solal would have this a it piffling sister acoustic and laid back in it approach this tune is a near perfective tense dark sung dynasty with it perverted harmonica interlude it bound to sooth whatever sorrow youre experiencing and postulate you to a calmer localise african velvety whilst at first this may not seem like your ordinary album closer african velvety is probably one of the most interesting track on the album with it hand peck guitar segment and it front line horn strain it a perfective tense way to close of this special album with a smooth bass line hinting the like of la femme dargent velvety will doubtless sparkle interest and continue you listening to the finally note a great way to close off love i gave this effort from air four star in the end but im not ruing out a higher score it definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really soak in not a accessible a their earlier album but for anyone who been hanging for a unlike approach fomr these french ambient master your wait is over if i could relate it to any album previously relinquish id say cycle legend on one hand this album may be sour for buff of air more chill out tune but on the other love ha the making of attracting a whole modern market denomination of listener from all box of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll grow on you trust me
0	seriously no wonder black people laugh at u i think it white people and all musician for that matter start bringing actual musician for the generation who may not know what that is it people with rhythm and who pick up these funny thing called instrument back into the recording studio this synthesized stuff is too tacky for word it give me elevator and walmart sense memory i dont even think this is good enough a musak award

1	i really wish they would do more cover this turned into an amazing project for their fan thank you shinedown
0	not regular going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash it a shame what pass for hip hop these twenty four hour period people look to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all because lil wayne is whack im not a hater i dont gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all he just another average untalented main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pas off a hip hop also the fact that people are claiming that the album in the howard carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach if this dude the best there is you guy can have him i prefer a picayune more substance in my music
0	i love dyan this cd came a a shock slow boring uninspired unspeakable update i listened to it again it even worse than i mean his singing is like a parody it amateurish hed be laughed off the stage at american idol horrible i cant believe he released this

1	cripple creek by harvey reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance keltic flavor drawing string to his music which only make it more appealing
1	i love this song on top it it wa super easy to download and to listen on any device
1	i discovered amazon cloud and the first piece i downloaded wa der teufel and the audio fill the room i recommend the cloud and the schubert for how can you go wrong

0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline like she wa purportedly a country vocaliser with a beautiful vocalize i wa curious so i checked her out i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor fleet i think that a song compilation would be enough and trust me it wa enough the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated patsy is also quite ugly and cant carry a tune after youre done burning this album also incinerate anything by alison krauss emmylou benjamin harris loretta lynn and old dolly parton instead listen to real female country artist like shania twain taylor fleet carie underwood dixie chick gretchen wilson reba mcentire and sugarland
1	even if pious platitude you dont dance you cant help but move to this music
1	of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time however a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound the music here strong throughout the cd and the movie in addition to the main theme the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite it pretty simple if you are a big fan of the movie youll highly enjoy this sound track if you like great western themed or classical have never seen the movie youll also like this soundtrack strongly recommended
0	you could not tell this wa a live recording and i wanted a studio version .
0	wtf is this trash . this album suck . the weekend killin you
0	just ok
1	i just love it . the music is will done .
1	great remix of one of the key song of the show give a great feeling to a strong show number
1	great song from a great band that will no doubt turn out many more terrific song in the future . so far demon is my favorite song from this group .
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album , isaac seems to have lost his touch , or his will to create masterpiece .
1	even though the track promise that this is disco , it is really not . it is bright and shiny tech-house . if it is disco you want , ian pooleys hyperdisco remix brings in the appropriate bass riff . dave angel take his own remix funkier but no le shiny . wax doctor , not surprisingly , let the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze . still no disco , but that is fine .

0	horrible . sings through his nose and steal all of his guitar lick from others . do not bother with this one .
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their mind .
0	the novelty wear off very quickly . a couple of listens and i wa done with it .
1	maybe this album is not a good a rejoyce , but it is still great , i just love her !
1	love it !
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase . the song were not the kind i enjoy . i believe it sold by jakes name .
0	bernie the buffoon is an even bigger joke than i thought . bahaaaaa !
1	this is a very good cd for the price . i bought this cd just for that one song that i did not have but wanted .
0	i know lot of folk love this album . i have been a huge boc fan since they started in 72. i can not listen to this album . except for the remake of astronomy , the song are awful . boc always have great song , very melodic , a pleasure to listen to . this is not true on this album . one bad album out of all their album is not a tragedy . they continue to put out good album to this day . i will be seeing them yet again in san francisco on july 20. i guarantee they will not be playing any song from this dog . it is all taste anyway . to those who love it , enjoy it for me , because i can not .
0	i yawned . i actually yawned .
0	this review is directed at the vendor a opposed to the actual album . do not buy from new chapter recycling , this record shipped in a plain white cover ( and damaged at that ! ) instead of the original cover a seen in the pic . ridiculous , sending back and ordering from another vendor .
0	there is a reason this recording is dirt cheap - it is a live recording with somebody coughing all through it . you would think they would have chosen a better performance to try to sell .
1	i will always love 3 door down !
0	this is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp . it is complete with tic and pop . the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo part of the recording . i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape and wa very disgusted with the sound . my worn cassette copy wa much better . i would give it a zero for the rating if i could . the performance is wonderful and exciting , but badly mangled by the transfer . do not buy this under any circumstance . instead look for the original rca cd . this should have been properly labeled a aad mono .
1	this come from one of the more obscure gerge harrison album but will always be one of my favorite song !
0	it is a cd , wooh .
0	i did not realize that i had this song available to me until i saw it in the list of item that i supposedly bought and then when i read the other review and found out it is a free download i decided to listen to it . i listened for about 20 second , clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is . yes , that is why it is free !
1	love it , best vocal on history , oh my gosh , unbelievable .
0	hurt my head . i am too old for this at 50 ! for sure .
0	nothing wrong with ac/dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like 30 year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac/dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind . for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need . well maybe two , if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc . they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet , hit package or live album get boring .
1	great cd and great series . i own all of them . steve boalt
1	this album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with a pop edge to it . with a very high level of musicianship , dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acoustic folky song . amazing songwriting musically and lyrically !
0	disk skipped in place
1	i saw paul simon live 2 day before this album came out . usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff , you generally do not want to hear it , you wan na hear the hit . this wa a special case . he played about 5 or 6 song from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more . i wa blown away . he talk about how he spent some time in the amazon , going on a spiritual journey , drinking this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca , and seeing spirit . for a 74 year old man , it is quite impressive and hilarious . i am very excited to finally own this whole album .
1	worth it !
0	thought the song would pick up but it doe not - we were looking for something a little more dramatic but it is kind of bland .
0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim , after i came across it while looking for another music title . i remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtrack , and thought that this would be similar ; but wa disappointed . i thought that this recording seemed fake , a if made by a synthesizer ( or in a bathroom ) . the track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop . like you , i base my purchase decision on the experience of others . if you liked my review , or felt that it wa helpful to you , then please let me know by clicking yes below . i would also be happy to answer any question that you may have about this product . thanks ! my review are real , and typically based on week of actual product usage . my opinion are not copied from other review , and are from my own personal experience .
1	get hype
0	i would not download this piece of dung if they were giving away free digital downloads of it ! always hated this song . the other day , it wa being played at work and i felt like jumping out the window or at least leaving the building for a breath of fresh air .
1	what can i say , great song from my teenage year . now i have my teenager liking it . lol
0	this is a horrible arrangement . mr. hecocks begin with a bizarre cowboy theme on all black key that a piano student would learn on his first lesson . this theme is repeated during the recording . what doe a cowboy theme have to do with a worship song . strange .
0	a nice album comprised of 12 track which have already been published under the how-the-west-was-swung series by wr record ( vol . 1 through 10 ) . very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release , may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best-of compilation . if you have bought the wr record series , you do not necessarily need this album .
1	great song , heard it in life is strange
1	excellent
1	cd wa in great condition
0	i have been a fan of buffy and james marsters for year , but wa not thrilled with this at all . the music wa boring and not a exciting a his brief singing spot on buffy . i would pas on this one .
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . the amazon downloader would not allow a second try . i asked for and received a refund .
1	heard this on a cable tv play list and had to find it ! had never heard it before and i am glad i did !
1	fan !
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	great

1	excellent
0	racist
0	what happened
1	this song is musically beautiful , and the lyric seem to speak to me far too often . cyndi laupers voice is expressive and this song is so touching .
1	the sound is rich , the harmony are deep , the arrangement are original . i have played it many time and recommended it to friend .
0	do not . it doe not have vocal track in the mix . it is a straight-up repeating beat . when i previewed it , i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample . after all , it list all of the rapper in the artist column . wrong . wrong . i just spent a buck on half of this song . thanks a ton , whomever came up with this idea .
1	sweet song
1	love it , love it , and really really love it ! yeah a 40 something year old like ke $ ha - part of me is embarrassed , and part of me is psyched ! ke $ ha is awesome !
0	i have never laughed so hard at a classical music piece and the false ending just make it even funnier . maybe i should give it more star because it really brightened my day . plus it made me feel better about my own piano playing .
0	not the version i knew or wanted . did not know that before purchase ! wa not given possibility to see that it wa a different version . did not say remix when purchased .
1	great song , great copy , sound great . i will be downloading a lot more song from amazon very soon . loved it !
0	this is not the ep version . : (
1	this album is definitely worth buying ! wonderful song from start to finish , no skipping necessary . amanda shire fiddling skill , creative lyric , and sweet voice will have you listening to this album on repeat .
0	after download it wa fuzzy and distorted
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music , so i ordered the album . the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment . the mastering of this album is terrible . a number of the song on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect . when you hear the song live , the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance . but on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music . i ran the album through a live music audio enhancer ( claesson edward live audio enhancer ) and it helped quite a bit . normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open . not with song like radioactive , the before is scattered and full of clipping . which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your stereo ; because they have been processed and helped ( not fixed ) . the end result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is .
0	i like bar and band version of song , but this ha too much not funny in it for me . it is one thing to be drunk and hear story and laugh about shooting your neighbor cat , sleeping with your cousin , sister , brother , dad , or whatever else is in this music . line about the anus detract from the music for me . clean it up , be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music .
1	one of his best and one of the best holy night version ever done !
0	this is not mine !
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five star im not sure if they are real people or work for three door down
0	it did not work like i thought it would to guide u a we accended to the top of pike peak . we had trouble downloading this item .
1	the best in country music .
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist , but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad . i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	a beautiful song . i created a cd to use in my work a a massage therapist , and included this song . lovely !
0	bought this a a gift for a family member who love musical . the song title do not appear on screen when they are playing . very frustrating !
1	a few of the song are out of show order , but glad to see they put all the big song on it this season . wish a cd version wa offered , though .
0	not able to listen the cd is blank
0	100 % trash with disgusting text and poor music .
1	great song !
1	this song is amazing . it explains how he refuse to live a life that is not holy and acceptable by god . this song is one of those who minister to both the saved and unsaved .
1	i perfect feel good summer jam !
1	this song ha just enough of a mix of pop and funk to sound very enjoyable for everyone who hears it . it is just simple and fun to listen to !
1	beautiful music . perfect for the holiday season !
1	artist all the time do remake of some of the classic . sometimes they take on song that shoe are too big to fill so to speak . but in this instance chris brown did it justice and then some .
1	the song is one of roberta flack most memorable song dating back to the seventy when she sang at mr. henry in dc .
0	mac milliers getting lazy with his writing . hip hop is more then just refurring to every woman a a b * or a ho and making million and that is all this guy think it is about . it get redundant real fast .
0	it s scratched and my fault that i am too late to return it , the cut off date wa oct. 18. we were gone for 3 week and 2 that were in a row . if i can still return it , please let me know , a i would certainly change my review . josh groban is wonderful .
0	excellent presentation , but it is the worst floyd album ever ! they should regret to had produced it .
0	i expected to get the song i heard on youtube , not this one with half of the lyric deleted . not what i wanted at all .
0	ooh , an electronica pop christmas song ! no , wait . it is another lady gaga song about sex where she turn everything into innuendo . guess what the christmas tree is . yep . at least it wa free and i did not waste any money on it .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyrically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am biased that way .
1	excellent
1	you either get it or you do not . but if you do get it then you will love it . unique , spacey , cosmic , trippy , technical and melodic . overall it is a great solid album . recommended to fan of voivod , toxik , watchtower , rush , vector , atheist , cynic or any other technical/prog band
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording , which is often far from modern convention . i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of . the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical . maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux . quite far from heifetz , milstein and younger violinist . if you like more objective style , this is not the best option . stay with szeryng or milstein .
0	not good . at all .
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence . an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need it , for exampl , e because of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder . a complete and utter waste of money and time . this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence , but will certainly line the pocket of daniel goleman . do not waste your money on this no-help-whatsover book .
0	showed item to artist and wa told it wa fake . checked artist copy and it is completely different
1	love love love !
0	if you want conscious breathing exercise , i would rate this a 5. great for someone with asthma or other breathing issue . each step is breathing between different point of the body from eye brow to finger to toe . the problem i had with sleeping wa long pause between vocal instruction distracting pulling the focus to another place . i bought the cd to get further into conscious deep sleep . i had the reverse effect . however , a an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body , the meditation doe work . i feel refreshed yet energized .
1	enjoying listening to mark chesnutt on cassette especially bubba shot the jukebox , since that is what i call my new nissan juke , my jukebox . i wa ruining my cd so i have been playing cassesttes while i wash and wax my jukebox .
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd . she promised a come back to her earlier work , but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a low budget movie . i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul , en la intimidad , love , saliva , sudor , sangre ; too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed , she left her record label , sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell . every single efort from emi is wierd , i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound , like en tu y yo , en la fiesta mando yo , la loca ( what a waste of song , for cry out loud ! ) . the only one that is good ( and the only reason i gave her 1 star is no me enseaste , that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal , but the rest if bad , really bad . besides , the fact that she hired estefano to work with her , i wa expecting a very new sound , very cool , taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her 5 star paulina , but no , i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there . and also , i agree with the one who said that she need to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover , that will save her some embarrasment .
1	love anything josh sings
1	love it !
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
0	bought this for a client
1	love it !
1	beautiful , meaningful song ! god speaks through this song and encourages those who listen .
1	this song is awesome
1	liz ha had a rough couple of year . with that being said , she ha come out the other side stronger than ever . with more of a blues/rock sound and hard living lyric exodus of venus is her best work to date .
1	guy ! i wa so excited when i heard thalia wa going to have a new cd , and that excitement wa really worth it when i bought and listened to this cd ! all the song are just amazing ! thalia ha grown a an artist from album to album . all i can say is that i recommend this cd to everyone , it fantastic !
0	one song that is listenable but they changed from it is original composition . shame .
0	first off , i would like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound . it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time , i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song . on the other hand , i do not really like this album . a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to , but i do not get far in when i have to skip track . stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to , but the other song are sub standard . they consist of poor lyric , dodgy music and ridiculous spelling . this way is by far jewel best album , i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route . i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument , writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out . this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel , something which is actually credible . leave this to britney , mandy and jessica . oh and jewel , keep your clothes on . it not big , and it not clever ! you do not need to sell your body to sell record .
1	my favorite recording of my favorite classical piece . played by the master himself . it long but worth it . everyone should hear it at least once .
0	i really get sad when i hear this new rap crap on top of the greatest band ever . i used to go see these guy when nobody even knew who they were . maybe show of 50 or 75 people . that wa the good ol day . god do i miss the house man !
1	have you ever felt like your day wa dragging ? those day when you are upset for no reason at all ? how about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you are just not feeling the appropriate motivation . i have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above affliction is listen to eye of the tiger . this song will cure any mental ailment . they you should have it pumping through the street of alaska during the dark part of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression . i listen to this song and i am ready to take on the whole world ! to leap building in a single bound ! everyone need a daily doe of some eye of the tiger ! amazing !
0	i bought this for my grandparent who requested it . not my taste on music but it doe remind me of them .
0	i bought this album with an open mind . i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack , mendocino county line . that wa the only good track . i thought that with the like of sheryl crow , bonnie raitt and rob thomas , this would be a comperable a the santana compilation . i wa sorely disappointed . the other celebrity artist sang back-up . you could barely even hear them . this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun , but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror . do not buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down the drain .
0	surely this is a joke ? this music is terrible . save your money folk , this is not worth 9 buck . nobody should be paying money for somebody youtube music
0	i did not like any of this music . terrible selection . i am going to try and get a refund for this purchase .
0	having the lp were did the dvd come from ? being a crazy fan of the fox and it is mighty wurlitzer i bought the ( 3 ) album and have transfered them to cd . went to the last two midnight concert were there wasnt standing room in the building . seating about 4000+ now sf ha a world class organ sitting in a wearhouse covered with dust awaiting to be reinstaled in the civic building and not being done because the city father can not get off their tail and get it done . if they do not want to do it let general publit do it .
0	i have not listened to it due to technical problem .
1	beautiful !
1	this is a great cd . i saw gloria bill in concert in cadiz , ky back in october . i bought their cd and could not stop listening to it . always sometimes is one of my favorite song now . oh yeah , and the sister of the lead singer work at sonic here in cadiz . funny , huh ? mmmmmmm . cheeseburger .
1	excellent album by christopher cross . i bought extra copy for friend .
0	i only heard 1 song off the album but sometimes i wait i do not want something i cant give back , i like to give but i do not want to give back better save your money , i heard a song i did not like , i only heard 1 song off the album , better save your money
0	i went on ringtones for android , listened to i walk the line and bought it . problem is it wasnt a ringtone , but the whole song .
1	love it .
0	i never received my download it would never go to the music on my phone i want my money back bc i bought two copy of the song
1	come on it is led zeppelin : d
0	this probably is not the recording of this much praised song that you want - go to the album i want to see the bright light tonight and try the song there first . i think i mis-bought this version first and could not understand why it wa so often mentioned a among richard and lindas best . just saying .
0	this song is pretty slow , i think . i do not know why i did not like it . i just did not like it very much .
0	i do not normally give a poor review . i am more likely to lean toward average or better . the product is fine . play well , no issue at all . the problem i have is that i did not get it for over 24 hour . i think today you should be able to purchase a song on-line and be able to play it then and there . i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting . i will not buy music from amazon anymore . but i will still buy everything else !
0	not the original version
1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best : live show . this show is special for quite a few reason , one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer 2010 tour . this release is the 2nd night of a two-night run , if you were a member of the warehouse , you could have gotten both night . anyways , this show is incredible , for those who complained about the last release sound issue ( live in new york ) , this release sound amazing , and on a side note , i could not really hear any problem with the new york release , but i digress . the show start with an explosive you might die trying , a great way to start thing off . dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song , you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fan . dave doe a partial good good time , a nice surprise for the fan that go straight into yet another incredible # 41 , and like every fan know , dave and the band always re-invent the song . there is so much energy in this show , it really feel like you are there in the crowd . after the incredible two step , dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop . if you are a fan , just buy because you know it is good , if you are new , still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live . dave and the boy still prove that after 20 year , they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best . and if you are lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer , i am sure itll be the concert of a lifetime !
1	this is a very nice rendition of this song . many different version of this song but so far this is probably my favorite version .
0	why is amazon selling nazi propaganda ?
0	do not have much to say about this a this wa something i had not even ordered . no real word for this at all .
0	100 % agree with other reviewer , these mp3s are censored and should be labeled a such
1	her voice is awesome . she could sing the worst song ever , and make it sound like silk !
1	the piano is very subtle and haunting almost i love the pause in between and the beat . it all gel together . i love the song , buy in !
0	great music obviously , but awful remastering - even worse than the 3cd chrome box . sound thin and tinny , like it is coming out of a transistor radio . the mighty chrome deserve better , but they will never get it a long a they are on cleopatra .
1	this music reminds me of the early album of gary numan , mostly because of the instrumentation used . i like the science fiction theme and robby garner vocal . prodigy 7 ha become one of my favorite , and i really like control .
0	downloaded it but it ha the same defect a the 30 year old cd track .
0	they used to be cool . every song on this album sound the same . this record could not be more boring , and redundant . they should drop an n , because there is no point in listening to it . it blow . do not buy this !
0	not really the song . generic . so disappointing in this purchase
0	weak vocal , weak instrumental . they clearly have lowered the key for several song yet joseph sound like he is straining . he sound like he is lying on his back with a collapsed lung . where is the donny osmond version that i love ? other version of this soundtrack are 5 star . this one is terrible .
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable . you would have to be a moron to enjoy this .
0	beyond stupid . even more stupid and irritating than actually having 2 phone
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
0	disc 2 of this digital audiobook is damaged . i tried downloading it a couple time , but it always skip repeatedly after about 23 minute into that disc . this is the equivalent of selling a new paper book with missing/ripped page . unacceptable .
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
1	these song take me way back and i feel like i am right there with him when he sings . the song are uplifting .
1	i like this song , i love that usher gave a sweet undertone to a dance type song . i like just about everything from guetta .
1	this is one of my favorite old school christmas song . this is a classic .
1	great album ! thank you !
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd , then do not even bother with this album . not too long before this cd came out , trivium covered metallicas master of puppet . in all honesty , the song rock ! but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica . this new album is a complete letdown . trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy , and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is , frankly , depressing . from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort , i give this album two thumb down ! please , for the love of ( insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here ) , revert back to your original sound , trivium !
0	stupid song
1	one of the top 10 christmas single ever .
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe , this song is not only catchy , but powerful and sang really well . i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over . excited for the full album !
1	awesome
1	great song
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock , rod should not attempt to do old standard . strictly commercial , no heart .
1	very smooth ! keep the music going brother , do not sellout to the usher , rkelleys r & b of mainstream etc . stay pure .
1	it is a fantastic mp3 that i can blast into my ear via my mp3 player=what is not to love ? i love how easy it is to purchase great sounding mp3s through amazon .
1	loving this song so much
0	well . the music itself is engaging . i had heard the song on a cruise ship and wanted the music to help learn the dance . sadly , the lyric are nasty , even in the radio version .
1	amazing album !
1	okay , after using that annoying pun , allow me to elaborate a little bit : lee greenwood is one hell of a performer ! i have to admit , this is the first album of his i have bought ; and no , in case you are wondering , the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd ( it did not hurt thing , though ) . i will get right to the album , save yall any more small talk . i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting ; after all , usa is a superbly written song . i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter . that is the bad thing . the good thing is , greenwood voice is rich and pure . he take these songs- absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer- and turn them into something memorable . most of em deal with love , of course ; it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker , while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery ( at least , from a man perspective ) . rock that you can not move is about getting on with life through the hardship ; round here take a look at small town . and the new excellent , emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever . lee greenwood is not trying anything new here . this is territory that is been traversed before , to be sure . but his voice is unique ; his sense of timing and style is un-matched . aside from the excess photography ( not badly done , but unnecessary ) , this album is a musical gem . it may not be stronger than time , but it is definitely the album of the moment . so , to continue on with the cliche : seize the moment , and along with it , lee greenwood stronger than time !
0	i have ordered 2 time the same product from amazon and the 5th track had a problem on both .
1	these remixes are slammin ! you will dance and laugh outloud . warning ! this stuff is explicit . headphone at work , and in public , are reccommended . jonny mcgovern is genious . the remix of do not fall in love with a homo took his already riotous , totally barry white inspired , slow jam and made it a dance club classic . check it out . you must .
0	not that bad of a tribute cd , but a for myself , i would really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp . the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album . if you are a major , and i do mean major floyd nut , you may get more out of this cd than i did . the track the great gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy , the woman vocalist just go on and on . to put it another way , the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band . tune like speak to me , brain damage and eclipse are okay , at best .
1	i have not heard anything of his since the crossover that i did not like . i can listen to him all day .
1	danceable .
1	thank you , maurice white , for sharing your great talent with the world . you will live on through this incredible tune .
1	a a wildland firefighter travailing the country , this song hit home for me and my boy . what a great sad story .
1	if you are reading this review , then you mustve been born recently , or stuck in some other time space continuum . i purchased this tape year ago when pete rock & c.l . smooth were new artist , and this song/album still bang now like it did then . i am just updating to digital .
0	this cd length singe-track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle . i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound . generally , the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl ( probably jaguar or leapord ) loudly punctuates the sequence . it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered . once you know this is present in this recording , it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again . imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour . now try to relax .
1	the song is great . i have been listening to it for year . it is just what i expected . that is the reason i bought it . i have been buying song from amazon since they started selling them . i am going to copy this and paste it to every song that i review . i hope you do the same .
0	dissapointed with this one . love johnny cash but the sound on this one is not good . sorry that i downloaded it to my kindle .
0	this is not the theme from enterprise . this is the same song , where my heart will take me , that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series .
0	i ordered this twice and both time the record would skip , like it wa warped . it did not look like there were any scratch .
0	save your money .
1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl . have not tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly .
0	i like the beat & the tune , but could do without the lyric . where al word crime ha similar beat & tune but happier , fun lyric .
1	a a worship leader i look forward to every new release from chris tomlin . each new project will contain song that , in time , become the cornerstone of our worship set . i have listened to burning light almost non-stop for the past several week and i believe this is one of tomlins strongest effort to date . listen to this project for a couple of day and you will not be able get the tune to whom shall i fear ? out of your head . we incorporated his rendition of crown him with many crown ( majesty ) on easter sunday morning and it wa very moving . keep em coming chris .
1	she is always a 5 star to me .
1	i love barbra streisand . the duet are great . another gift from my daughter for christmas .
1	thank you wilco !
0	this digital copy seemed to be poor quality . i purchased it after listening to it a a billion time on on you tube and it just doe not sound the same . excellent song , but i will continue to use the the youtube version .
0	very poor recording quality .
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine . purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his 1967 basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t-bone burnett , an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of 1975-6. nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the 1970s . rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept . musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known ( burnett wa a relatively early costello producer ) . burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab , inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric . costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could . so what attracted him to the project ? my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch , although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river . some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time . dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious . the serious lyric were more elliptical , open , and allusive than his previous song . the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang . quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction . most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those are not successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness . there wa also a cable film tie-in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition . no matter , each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record . giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording . jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener . taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated singer compared to the others . instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion . the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best . dylan wa the other tie-in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year .
0	sum 41 ha no talent . they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible . if you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre , try new found glory , the ataris , or maybe older blink-182 material . this album is made for stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason . it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there . do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band . pick up some afi or bad religion to truly understand the real meaning of being punk .
0	i wa out christmas shopping today and the store i wa in wa playing this cd in the background . when i went to purchase my item i heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me . the manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded the new jessica simpson christmas cd . i heard the manager then reply can you please stop the music , it is scaring the customer and it is really bad for business . i wa so enthralled and fascinated at this point i had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she wa so insistant that they cut the cd off . i went online later and listened to happy christmas and found out myself why . it wa truely awful . i am sorry i do not want to hear jessica simpson singing christmas carol when it sound like she needed to blow her nose every song . jessica simpson is just a strange creature . why doe she continue to make music ? it really tell me something when there is only 12 review on here . plus she date athlete . creepy .
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick ! the mastering on this album suck . period . i am listening on a rega system . where is the production from the alchemist ? they sounded great over just blaze production on the song with em . they are trying to get into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly . they pick the worst beat from these producer . yes these guy can rhyme . why can not they make good song ? ( unless they are rapping over someone el beat . ) the single were weak but i expected that . guest feature from cee-lo , ( singing that awful hook ) busta , skyler grey , ( never heard of her ) bob , swizz , and em . wtf i blame eminem , jimmy iovine , and interscope record . yes these guy deserve success but not with this album . knick knack paddy wack how i wan na bone cmon joell . these reviewer are saying they are bringing back lyric . i am going to listen to the hip hop weekly series , mood muzik , the bar exam and pretend our house never came out . and to that first review . killer mike r.a.p . music is the album of the year so far .

0	i wa looking for strictly disney song to be played by string , no singing . the music sample clip are mis-leading because the song color of the wind , a whole new world and beauty and the beast all had terrible singer singing along . i do not understand why it is 101 string ochestra and then singing for a few of the song . it feel like there were some singer that loved these song and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental . those three song were what made me purchase this cd . had i known there would be terrible singer singing along to the music , i would not have bought this cd . the music for all of the other song are really nice though ; they are what i wa looking for . listening to a whole new world right now make me want to gouge out my eye ; singer sing at such a slow pace and it sound like they are amateur singer at the local karaoke .
1	the greatest band no one ha ever heard of ha done it again . how doe a band get better and better after every album is beyond me . happy to call them my favorite band with one of the greatest song writer ever .
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment ! it felt good to listen to ! life wa good ! but then in 1992 along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music , and rock wa never really the same again . everybody wa miserable . nobody had any fun any more . if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time , then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the 80 . stuck in the 80 ? well , if making music for entertainment purpose only , and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an 80 thing to do , then the 80 is where i want to stay ! grunge make you feel like killing yourself . in the 90 i used to like grunge , and i went through a period of severe depression . but in 99 i took all my nirvana , pearl jam , soundgarden , and alice in chain cd and i burned them ! and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band ! and my depression instantly disappeared ! i wa finally happy for the first time in 3 year , and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd . i do not recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody . grunge is the most depressing music in the world , and basically just encourages you to hang yourself . it cause depression and suicide ! do not poison your mind with this morbid garbage ! stay away from grunge !
1	just amazing after all these year . i have petitioned james taylor to put out a dvd of the current tour since they are not coming anywhere near southern california . but , these track are all wonderful and the accompanying dvd is a wonder and joy to behold . do not doubt it , if you like james taylor , get this one . hurry !
0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd . i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen , ( very good song ) but this eternalize cd fell way short . musically these kid are very talented and great musician , however i thought the song writing wa bad , the lyric bad , and the vocal were bad - vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling . sarah need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own signature and personality into them - not just read them off the sheet of paper . she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent . remember her janis joplin cover turtle blue ? that is what i am talking about . she need to do more of that . this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd . somebody need to help them with their songwriting . it wa all over the place on this cd . i am hoping they can turn it around , but for now i am backing off for a while to see where they go from here . good luck you guy .
0	this is not my type of music .
1	my little boy will listen to this song over and over . great way for memorizing scripture .
1	good song
0	ok
0	not even going to bother with this unless they are 320kb quality . why even bother with something low quality ? seriously .
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria , periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world . the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year . the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it is own , albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos . periphery brings enough fresh idea , along with a solid understanding of their root , to craft an album well worth owning . while certainly not for everyone , a the screaming can get pretty brutal , the quality is high from beginning to end . if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection .
0	i bought this for my aunt because she remembered it from she wa a kid and she claim she is happy with it . i do not care for this type of grade school music
0	awful . doe not sound right at all . i would love my.money back if i could figure out how
1	1. i need your lovin 4.24 2. drummer beat 5.20 3. let u turn it up 4.49 4. just feel it 5.19 5. y.e.a.h . 5.09 6. licensed operator 6.24 7. tease me 6.14 8. mind , body and soul 5.22 9. come back 2 me 4.42 10. aint no miss 5.02 11. sundress 6.11 12. i never knew 6.12
0	most of the music start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a jazzy type sound which doe not do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep . of course the sample that are given do not let you know that . worst 1.99 i have spent . may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window . amazon can do that with it is own money . i will not purchase another music from them .
1	she is amazing singer and she is even better live . i wish i could find all of her song live !
0	this cd wa bought by mistake by me , doh ! so you know , this is a different guy . i guess if you like cheesy r & b/rap lite , it is ok. could not get through the 2nd song myself- sure he look different , but thought it wa early & a bad pic , haha- oh well . buy both of the real sean rowe cd or lp , they are killer !
0	i wanted the song so bad that i also ordered the re-mix but did not know that it wa the album . i don ; t have a turntable to play it on . i have no use for it .
0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented in many different aspect . he wa creative and every time i listened to his other show , i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked . his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field . this album is not creative nor funny . it is just hateful . mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop , fireman and snitch are , a well a fart and enema joke . go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy , because you will not find it here .
1	sound clear and no disappointment in quality . i am very happy with it and love the song . go for it !
0	i bought this album and accidentally had it playing in a snapchat i sent to my friend , next day i got sued .
0	this ha to be a joke . next he will duet with william hung . at least the profit go to charity . still just donate to charity and keep this garbage away from your ear .
0	advertised a the explicit , non edited version and it is not , it is the radio version . waste of $ 0.99 . i need more word .
0	ok relaxation music - but it just doe not do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
1	bad as !

1	beautiful
1	another one my mom got to enjoy for awhile before it wa passed back to me because mom and she ha now gone home herself yo heaven
0	my own throat feel strained listening to mr. dylan struggle through this genre . it is not for him . the sweet backup singer just do not help , and almost seem comical a counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this rebel-icon . if i were a little kid , i would run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen . actually , i may do that myself .
1	this is actually a great song . i am truly a died hard fan for k. michelle so i do not mind keeping it real . it is about time she is singing something that is a make up record . she ha always recorded break-up record and album , and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new . she is crazy , sometimes rude and take thing to the extreme , but one thing that is true is that she can sing ! support real music and trust she will deliver . you do not have to like her , but you have to like her music . and i love it ! she doe not have two number one album for no reason .
0	not impressed the tune the beat and the voice not good for me do not know what could of been better
1	two icon making great music together .
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song . this one is a great example
1	love this song !
1	i have hundred of xmas , am a dylan fan & read all the review here & wanted to add i love this cd . i agree with all the detail in the 5 star review & will not repeat them , but what stand out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangement here . it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & dylan raspy voice add the spice & crackling of the log . for me , this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra , manilow or bing . unlike other big name star who make the obvious xmas collection , dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over & over . definitely a keeper , from left field to center stage .
0	huge wz and rz here . this album is a bit disappointing . some have equated it to an ep and i agree . i believe rob is believing any crap he put out there is cool , well . it aint . love john 5 playing and hope rob put out more serious lyric and music next time .
0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked . the 3 song on the radio are the only one that are worth a s * , the rest of the album suck . which wa quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry . i would recommend others to only buy the song they like . and leave the rest .
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong . even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song , with each album outshining the last one . swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best-to-date album speak now , which , like fearless , is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to . but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel . her latest album , boldly named red , is an abysmal effort at best , creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble-gum pop princess pop , with an infantile attitude and horrendously little-girly lyric . those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed : swift ha not grown with her 4th album but shrank , or more explicitly , aging backwards ; her song are now for 13-year-old girl ( or younger ) and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute ! the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together . the title of the song is already bad enough , but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt , after all , one of the song on her last ( deluxe ) album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful , heart-felt song ( and one of my favorite from her ) . this time however , luck ha ran out ; it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined . how bad ? well , let u just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday , but unlike rebecca black , she can not plead lack of experience or young age . it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk . at one point she even croons : i say , ` i hate you , we break up , you call me , ` i love you . an accurate parody of the song can be thus : oh so i told you the other day , i called him up , and he wa like : ` can we make up ? and i wa like : ` no way and he wa like ` please and we ended up in like , this restaurant , and then he said something that i did not like , so i wa like : we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again . and he wa like ` whaaaat ? and i wa like yep . i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well . after all , just how many time can one over-estimate the american audience anyways ? the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst i have heard of taylor swift so far . the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re-e-e-e-e-d and me-e-e-e-e-e that went along her usual chick-self-victimizing lyric that , unlike the last couple of album , lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain , thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego-centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader . while any song on red that actually sound tad-bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december . even worse move wa to invite other ( male ) singer to collaborate song with her . normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio , we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally , but now , with other singer , the difference is painfully acknowledged . especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol . lightbody essentially owned the song , out-reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing-along audience in the background . there ha always been argument of swift genre : whether she can be considered country or just pop . and it did not matter because she wa good at what she doe . but now , with this album , who can really say that she is still country ? her album is not even good pop . perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song-writers for bubble-gum pop and return to do everything by herself , or work with better musician ( her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war , many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing , and they are justified in their skepticism-she is clearly not on that level yet ) a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe , she should slow down and take a good look around her . being ego-centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while , but too much of something is rarely a good thing . because the truth of matter is , the world is composed of much bigger thing than her .
1	i just watched the blu-ray of the movie woodstock - it ha the csn & y version at the end of the movie , but jm get a separate credit for writing the song .
1	typical hank williams , jr. modern country with a serious message . make me proud to be an american .
0	this is a big disappointment . this is just a awful a bionic . her voice is just nasty . i should have bought a holiday album instead of this .
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music - and i have not yet heard all of her 1990s-era release ( because they are a little difficult to find . ) but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s fall into the pop and light jazz genre , i get the impression that for hetero her manager ( or producer , whatever , ) wa trying to nudge her into alt-rock , that tane herself wa more interested in . pop and light jazz , but acquiesced to a harder-edged album all the same . an artist is going to follow her own path , obviously , but i wish tane-san wouldve done an album or two more of straight-ahead rock , because she is good at it and her voice is well suited for it . the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity , because although it ha some minor downside , it is akin to a buried pop-rock treasure . since there is no track listing here i will do a blow-by-blow : 1. kaeshite ( give it back ) start with a strange , almost playful verse , take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression , pick up a stark , thin drumbeat , then dive into an excellent , somewhat angsty chorus which , again , traverse a chord progression unlike anything i have heard before . just a great , understated rock tune . 2. down is far more poppy , but with the same arresting vocal attitude . the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard , but here is where tanes unique voice shine through . it is difficult for me to explain exactly why , but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow . maybe it because of that strange vibrato , which sound both tightly-controlled and loose at the same time , but that comparison keep jumping out at me , even year after i first heard this disc . 3. cut the fruit is a little funky , a little jazzy , with beautiful , floating , upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus . there is a satisfying gnarly-twangy guitar break in the bridge , then back to that glide-groove , then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end . just an excellent groove from start to finish . 4. ame to gamu ( chewing gum candy ) is hard to describe . again it is vocal over acoustic guitar ( something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me , ) but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding . there is a lot of really weird instrumentation ( synth wash , and . french accordion ? ) but it all mesh perfectly . the bridge is a bass solo , something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit . if you have spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop , one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum-dum-dum-dum-dum drone buried deep in the background , but rather is an integral , catalyzing element of the mix . how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth ( masaki of daida laida and liv moon , koga michiko of doll $ boxx and gacharic spin , king-san [ formerly ] of shakalabbits , onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary , hibiki of light bringer , etc. , ) is beyond me . ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal . but i am really , really glad that is the case . anyhow , ame to gamu is an unforgettable song , and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here . and i almost forgot : something that put a big , goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three-chord figure in jimis wind cry mary . whether that is incidental or intentional , it . just make me smile . 5. memoria is maybe the best song on this album , but undercut by an annoyance in the recording : the heavier part are noticeably distorted . you have to push that annoyance aside , because memoria is just epic - one of those song that is like a heartfelt little journey or adventure . it begin soft a a feather , build and build , explodes in anthemic chorus , then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected , melodically-magical passage that build to it own crescendo - with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal - to end on that same soft-as-a-feather place it started . this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today , yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life , a song that is been with you for year . that , folk , is powerful songwriting . just a great song - easily one of my all-time faves . it is unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus , but . great song . 6. no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon - but this is the tune i like least on the album , mostly because of the chorus , which have tane stretching her range too much , amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman / i wan na be your woman . it is not a horrid song , but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying , and the bridge is just weird , and not in a good way . 7. kakekko ( sprint or race ) is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb-ambience , evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst . there is also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge . 8. kage no naka no kage ( shadow in the middle of a shadow ) is the most jazzy tune on the disc - more in line with the stuff she is done since - but an excellent , relaxed groove . 9. daite te hoshii ( i want you to hold me ) is another jazzy tune , mellower than kage , with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse , then the same over a drumbeat , with some funk-flavored instrumentation with the chorus . the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song , which lead me to believe it is one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality ( just a guess , since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language , namely , where is the beer ? where is the restroom ? and i love you , generally in that order - and i have not sat down to translate it . ) 10. tree close out the album in a dreamy , atmospheric wash , with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly . there are two break into slower-tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song . an understated but relentlessly cool tune . i am far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop , so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album , hetero is her standout disc - for that rock element . but again , i still have not gotten around to getting her other 90 disc . if you like alt-rock that is generally upbeat rather than a massive boat-anchor of metaphysical angst , and if you enjoy totally unique voice , get hetero . definitely time well spent .
0	i am a huge fan going way back , so i will not say directly that it suck ( but it definitely lack gravitational pull ) . bob tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these christmas standard ! the zydeco arrangement on must be santa is kinda fun , but his shredded voice just make me imagine that i am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube . i feel this cd could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health class . student would listen and compare nashville skyline with this dreck and thus learn an impacting life lesson on the danger of cigarette .
0	i downloaded this song twice and both time the lead singer channel had much le volume than the version i reviewed . almost like the right-left channel were not set the same . somebody need to have a look at the setting on this download .
0	i thought my having just downed a hard cider wa making me hear this song in some distorted way , but after reading everyones review , i now see it is not me on a buzz . this song is just horrible . it is off-key , the vocalist can not carry a tune in a bucket , and is that the sound of cat fighting in the background ? a frank barone from everybody love raymond used to say , hooooly crap . thank god it is free and i could hit cancel on the download .
1	one of his best to date
0	it is a good song but it is not a spectacular song . this song is lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music . i love gaga , but not this song
1	just a great a their first !
1	excellent song and very spirited .
1	really really good !
1	you are the one is an award winning song and just to get that song is worth the price of the album .
0	i like the song very much . my copy skip . the gifted copy i sent to my girlfriend , turn up on her phone , but she must purchase . how do i get a refund ?
0	ac/dc fan will love to rock out with the master of rock . the recording are great , the hit keep coming song after song .
0	most likely not the song you remember . check the preview first .
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album , i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse . although second album are known to be difficult , i beleived the band to have promise . how wrong wa i. there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face . it all highly irritating , mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless . i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way , but there is no melody on this album worth writing about . i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did , and if you like lifehouse because of no name face , trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band . switchfoot , vertical horizon , jimmy eat world even the calling ( whose album i also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel ) are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid . spend your money and time elsewhere .
1	love this song !
0	again amazon.com did not download my purchase . this is not the first time but it is the reason i do not keep or alow amazon.com software or cooky on my computer . amazon.com ha used them to erase kindle book . that wa the greatest act of malicious malware i have ever come across . so now i eliminate all software , ie , the amazon.com music player , and the amazon.com cooky both of which were use in the malware attack on my kindle library . when amazon.com wa notified of this there response wa , wasnt me . again i warn buyer beware of amazon.com .

1	might be my favorite radiohead album ever . the instrumentation is gorgeous . thom yorkes voice is at it best .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
0	company wa great . thought it would be more contemporary music . the cd wa to much blue . depressing at best . others may like it .
1	i purchased this cd for my wife during christmas . she love jackie evancho and since she ha been playing it , i have also become a fan . miss evancho pose an incredible voice .
1	great product great seller
1	awesome
0	okay , this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or 21 at 33. but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album , this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road , honky chateau , rock of the westies , etc . many of the song on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej song ( just like belgium , chloe , the title track ) . but sadly the song fall a bit short . my advice ? skip this one and purchase jump up , which is not a great album , but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his 70 form .
0	this is the lowest form of music . it is following a predictable and waning formula . i have listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me . i have listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpet to entertain me .
1	i have seen it written that great art divide , and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs . for me , this is something decidedly different for the band , yet unmistakably dream theater . the shift in focus from shredding to melody , long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing . while it certainly a 5 star effort from the band , for my taste it a little samey . and i completely get why , a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera . for me , this may be a top 5 effort from them . it grows on me with each listen . strong 4 star rating from me .
0	this composition , while ambitious and promising at certain point , never really take off . the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument , but doe not go anywhere with it . the theme never develop , and the variation are not all that different from each other . i had high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion , but it wa just more of the same . i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction , however .
0	not clean ! still ha the word damn .
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever heard . a must for those who collect this type music .
1	a+
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
1	nice mellow song about reminiscing about day gone by what could have been if feeling between two people had been in sync .
1	can not go wrong with lauren daigle , she ha s an anointing on her
0	my mother and i absolutely love josh groban and this song . but we were very disappointed when it only played the first verse and the chorus like five more time . very disappointing rendition
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him . if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song for you !
1	cripple creek by harvey reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance . keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing .
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash ha everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand ?
1	nice mix of song .
0	i had no idea what they sounded like , but once i downloaded this song , i thought , what a waste of time ! do not bother unless you are a fan . i am certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon !
1	i love this album . favorite include anthem , run , outlaw , scared , chasing twister , and my whole life long . after it all make me weep with joy . if you have never seen them live , do not miss the chance . anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand take , few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live .
1	i do notknow why , but i love this song .
0	the cd stalled halfway through the first song . not satisfied !
0	this band is not original . they sound like everybody else . they are nothing new . i liked this band when they were called new found glory . brainwashed people . go listen to some real music , like refused or thursday .
1	10 year is one of my favorite band . you can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work . while i still prefer autumn effect , this album is solid , but that is not surprising at all . i really do not think 10 year is capable of producing crap . their music and the vocal are just too good . : )
0	do not care if it your birthday or not . the song is awful . she need to be banned from radio completely . hide your wallet so you can make her go away .
0	this is a waste of money . only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song . i thought it wa the actual cd decade because from the mp3 version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album . doe anyone know how to give le than one star ? james egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd .
0	i wa very excited to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i , m the biggest fun . once the cd arrived i put it on and i wa extremely disappointed . very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth . i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin .
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon . i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean . can not get in to this pop deluxe stuff . some of the rave review puzzle me . this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it . not trying to say jewel should stay confined but , just because record sale are lagging a bit , doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above ? i believe some call that particular horizon selling out . did jewel sell out here ? i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti-estblishment and human point of view jewel seemed to be telling u she felt in her heart . i know everyones got bill to pay , but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy fat record company . we have one britney spear . we do not need anything resembling anther one . i hope jewel find a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album . i would hate to think jewel feel she need to serve her ego .
1	the 80 relived
0	thought it would be a lighter selection of music , but way to somber for me .
0	i am not a fan of the new stuff . : (
1	catchy tune written by an old pro with many good song under his belt . i think it reflects on a career in a very messed up industry .
1	love it ! jill at her best .
0	this song becomes more and more depressing a time go along so i deleted it .
0	it doe not work , i bought it 2 or 3 time this wa a digital purchase
1	this should be an international anthem for the million who resist the 9 to 5. or the answer to the life long question . where do i fit in ? leave it to los lobos to put this worrisome question to a foot tapping celebration ala zydeco blue . all i can say is bon temp roule !
1	very good song !
0	i know i should have read the information closer so my fault but - there is only one song on this cd - one song . i wa hoping to hear more from this talented artist . i wa so disappointed .
1	all time great song by a great country singer . great to play at 50th wedding anniversary .
0	to much vocal music and noise .
1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruise and this song doe it for me , it brings back all the memory
0	nope no sale here . but i know my daughter like this group .
0	not the same kimbra !
0	sounded like a mexican band ; not country ; not my style . every song sounded the same ; no variety . if you are looking for country , this is not for you .
0	so bad and not in a good way .
0	there wa only one song . i wa ripped off . i felt cheated . amazon please let customer know how many song are on a cd !
1	love it . and just got exactly what i wanted and no more . save bzillians this way ! greatest invention ever in the music industy . thanks !
1	yes it is a great song !
0	i got it for free . at 1st i did not really like it . i like black veil bride and the fray . it is just not my kind of music . now i like this song though . i had to hear it a couple of time before it hit home .
1	good song , love her voice , love the beat put me in a good mood , i downloaded immediately after i heard the song on the radio .
1	i decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare . he is an interesting person with a unique , soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint . this ha been one of the best album that i have ever purchased to date . every song is different but exceptional too , especially hand are clever . hummingbird us a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus , whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activity . there is something no this album/cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at $ 5.99 ( which is a steal ) , you will not be disappointed . i promise .
1	great album .
1	another great song by matthew west ! this song can reach so many people , because everyone ha felt regret and despair .
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want .

1	it is light hearted and happy . it fit in nicely a background for a slideshow i did .
0	did not have the intro music .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	help to soothe and focus me
1	this is one of my all time favorite song . even if you are not a country music fan i would recommend this song . well worth the price of the mp3 .
1	getting a new album from robin feel like a gift from god . every song on here is wonderful- one hauntingly beautiful song after another . i already had do not cry alone and bought a cd from germany to get mother of love , but had never before heard any of the others . what a treat for every robin gibb and bee gee fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous song ! i can not stop listening to this album , especially anniversary and sanctuary !
1	a wonderful story about a man trying to help a heartbroken girl he meet in a bar and try to start a conversation with
1	yes ! yes ! yes !
1	the whole album ( cd , mp3 , etc . ) is awesome . spend some jack , get a real bargain , enjoy the sound . ken ooltewah , tennessee
0	do not download just this song , you only get the tail end when they are singing the do do du dupe part .
0	this is one of my all time favorite song ~ i got a new phone and wanted this a my ring tone like i had on my android . i down loaded the song and attempted to listen to it and got nothing but static . it wa a waste of my time and money !
1	inspiring song , love it !
1	carol of the bell is my favorite christmas song but with so many artist doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood . i think this version doe a very good job in that .
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year . that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album . i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened . now this . eric adam doe not sing lyric , it sound like he is saying them . he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal . hamzigs drumming is fine . it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song . i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doe not bother me on this album . it is simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe . dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling ? one of the few strong point of this album . it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him . ok time to hurt someone feeling . demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note . it is pretty bad and annoying . every song it sound the same . i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation . is this his attempt at dub step ? it certainly is not the true metal sound . the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience . one thing edm ha that this album doe not is heavy bass . seriously . if you are going to attempt doom metal ( black list ) . you need that deep bass . sorry . put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve . not so many song about viking ( which should be left to amon amarth ) and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric ( i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well . please ) . soth is an awesome album and this is not . at time they remind me of dr. sue rhyme ( which of course is what rap music is like ) . the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley . maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album ? let u take a look at each song : the lord of steel : start off like a dr. sue rhyme but ha musical moment . lazy lyric writing . poor opening song to an album . manowarriors : again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before . another disappointment . i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world . nope . born in a grave : finally some lyric and music that are different , not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it . at this point i ask , why is not eric singing ? righteous glory : first mention of odin on the album . it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one . he can sing so let him . i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album ? touch the sky : the bass is ridiculous on this song . it is like an incessant hum of tone and that is a shame because this is one of the better song on the album . like i mentioned , demaios bass playing demand an explanation . black list : attempt at doom metal that fall flat . humming bass that sound like edm . drumming could have been heavier a well . lyric are not good and vocal sound pro-tooled . this song could have been very good . expendable : a pathetic , sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money . this is the type of song that requires a 80 movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites . an incredible loss of power in his voice . did something happen to his voice that i do not know about ? el gringo : this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial . head for the border . annihilation : dr. sue rhyme . 1980s atari activision video game sounding bass . pro-tooled vocal . disgraceful . hail kill and die : now that they have hailed and killed for year it is time to die . duly noted . channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph . the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place . really douche chill inducing . the kingdom of steel : a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job . even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general . i hate i did not download it for free before purchasing it . this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre . i am sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album . anytime a band creates it is own studio the music suffers . much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died , this band is not the same since ross the bos . i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he could not take it anymore . technology ha ruined this band . they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing . that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time . i really want to love this band again . he need put aside the ftw i will do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing , blah blah blah . but you can not argue with crazy . some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced . maybe in 20 year he will remake this album too ?
1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market . blur , frank black , cranberry , the posy , jellyfish and others-what is not to like ? the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance ( guitar mostly ) of a quality so good you will be amazed . too bad that , in the end , suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist .
1	i bought four of these . two for myself , just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates . i have a vast sinatra collection . this is one of the top 5 disc . the others being only the lonely , swinging lover , september of my year and the live at the sand .being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot . being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed . it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find . having all these song in one collection is long long overdue .
1	good oldie classic rock song from the 80
1	i bought this album because i like the god bless the child track . i have been a fan of joe augustine for several year . will buy more .
0	i am very disappointed i thought this wa posted be a regular size cd i had no idea this wa a mini cd and i do not have a mini cd player at all so i could not even use this i am very disappointed on my purchase them to keep u posted on line i had the right to if i give it a one star rating i thought this wa post be a regular size cd i waste my money nobody should not buy this because you are gon na be disappointed when you receive it
1	if you like chicago & like christmas music , this is the cd for you .
1	love this version of tu amor mi amor by formula five . use to listen when growing . my mom love the song , good time .
0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here . i remember seeing an interview of the newest ( at the time ) leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos . sure we are entitled to forgiveness , but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory . after rjd ha passed no le . onto the music . the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire . he reminds of a better contestant on american idol . vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound , just doe not have any punch . everything else is just by the number . for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just do not even begin to break new ground , do nothing special with it , and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in . this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman , a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band . what a joke .
1	got ta love it !
0	pretentious , bombastic and utterly devoid of charm , this is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge . this is truly one of the worst album i have ever heard .
0	not at all what i expected . kind of insipid .
0	not that great . will
1	beautiful , male you cry
1	i needed to refresh myself on the lyric . i sang this song at a best friend wedding in the 1970s . then at his son , and now for the daughter . crazy thing is , when i wa younger , john denver wa a good friend . i miss him still .
1	ballet teacher and their student will love this song . basic dance vocabulary and movement are suggested along with tutu and tiara . a remarkable resource for ballet teacher .
0	god imagine dragon are a one hit wonder that have not gone away .
0	it is either badly done or just a really bad idea . elvis voice sound rough . i do not recall thinking that when i heard his original recording . it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match . it take away from his greatness rather than enhancing it . i will not be buying any more of the song from this album . i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard do not be cruel and hound dog played on my radio over 50 year ago . re-release more mix of his original if you must , priscilla , but please do not do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duet either . it is just disrespectful of his memory .
0	it is a sound track for the movie not the movie should be listed a the song from the movie zero dark thirty . but if they did that no one would buy it . frank bole
0	yikes , who knew the celt were such big fan of synthesizer ! this christmas enjoy all the soul-less expression of elevator music without the elevator . oh , and remember , it is free so you have to like it .
0	i paid for the song because i wanted the mp3 . after i paid for it , it will only let me listen to it through amazon . that doe me no good . i want the mp3 that i paid for .
1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time . this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz , post-bop and avant-garde . by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60 and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world . barry altschul is superb a well and yes , anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway . although being an item for accustomed ear , this is not to be missed by any real music lover .
0	came in distorted could not even hear it
1	i love the new cd .
0	did not sound a good a it did in bourne identity !
1	nice change for adam .
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the 3rd felt release ! i have only listened to it about 3 time , but my first impression were of disappointment . one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end ; this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed . i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me , but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining . there is a ton of talent in this trio , but it just doe not mesh in this album .
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time . : )
1	this is a great song that effectively satirizes maudlin garbage like the christmas shoe . if your fed up with a steady stream of artificial christmas cheer , and need something different , this song might be good for you .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
1	love it
1	for my mp3 player
1	i first heard this song while watching the movie , tha naked gun starring leslie nielson . i like it !
1	group 1 crew is an amazing band , and this album doe not disappoint ! i bought it for my sister and she love it . came in excellent packaging and we are enjoying it very much .
0	it is advertised a the explicit version , it is not
0	defective disc
1	great music ! loved it ! thanks a lot !
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline , like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice . i wa curious so i checked her out , i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift . i think that a 12 song compilation would be enough , and trust me . it wa enough . the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated , patsy is also quite ugly and can not carry a tune . after you are done burning this album , also burn anything by alison krauss , emmylou harris , loretta lynn and old dolly parton . instead listen to real female country artist like shania twain , taylor swift , carie underwood , dixie chick , gretchen wilson , reba mcentire and sugarland .
1	all about our god !
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard . she is also one of the most under-rated songwriter in the country . the story wa a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90 that included jennifer kimball . the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were/are inspired , and at time , their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear . my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine ( from story - angel in the house ) and eye in the sky ( from jonatha brooke - back in the circus ) . so much mine ( my absolute favorite ) is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician . the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry . the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project , release back in 1982. i am also a big fan of that band . all of jonathas album , both solo and from the story , are highly recommended . her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing , along with her interpretation of other artist song , is inspiring and ( at time ) haunting . her song stay ( and play ) in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work ( a a whole ) , i just can not imagine why she is not more popular . some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it ; latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance , while some of her song make you want to cry . she is that good . i do not know what else to say/write , other than buy her music !
0	6 star for the song , zero star for amazon help ( or lack of : ) in locating it on my computer . what can i say ? i like this tune a lot . buying it here wasnt that smart because i still have not found it on my computer and amazon help could not help me find it . shrug ? i ended up getting it from another website so it doenst really matter i guess .
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual . not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying , she actually sound like she is trying . id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day . i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture . please , do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist . i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do . i am forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is very generous a i do not even think it is worthy of review . i only do this to warn my fellow music lover .
1	even if you do not dance , you can not help but move to this music .
0	every song sound the same .
0	i pre ordered this record , so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived . i wa all but kissed the delivery man when it came ! i ran straight up to my record machine and played it , probably around 3 time before giving poor dierks a break . i listened to the record about 5 time after that before the unthinkable happened . it is different for girl began to skip ! i wa in shamble ! on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite record it wa skipping ! now i am not some record abuser and throw my record around no no no ! i have a special place where all my record are held and placed ever so neatly back into the slip and folder . and my needle is changed quite regularly , so nothing on my part could it have gone wrong . so when it began to skip you could imagine my horror , i have 20 year old record that are still playing me some good ole country without any skipping or anything ! i honestly can say the quality of this record is so horrible it completely ruined my experience with this record and let me tell you i am a hugeeeee fan of dierks , it wa a tragedy . you will never hear me say this ever again in my life but for this record it is better to litsen to it on your phone .
0	my favrit josh groban ever . i play it every few day . wish he would do more showtunes and le opera
1	it is thrice
0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything . it is a dreadful recording and the vocal on 2nd chapter are down right ear piercing , not in a good way . i remember being so much better , then again we all thought early christian rock/folk music wa delightful .
1	this downloaded to amazon cloud player and i had to install the app . i do not want the app . i wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my ipad . if i am listening to music on my ipad i will not be able to listen to this song without switching to the amazon app . that would b a pain . i thought this wa going to download to my ipad with all my other music . i have not looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over . i honestly do not think u can . this is why i gave it a 4. the song is great !
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day , wa nice just to purchase the song i wanted .
1	the first cut is the deepest is a 1967 song written by cat stevens , originally released by p. p. arnold in may 1967. stevens own version originally appeared on his album new master in december 1967. this one is ok , but cat version is the best .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
1	another classic !
1	this is a great collection of new wave jazz from him . one of the greatest . it is a classic . it is raw and contemporary . his piano skill are amazing get this one you will not be disappointed
1	wont go wrong , and enjoyed every second of eric claptons music . other downloaded mp3 music lacked clarity . you will not regret getting/purchasing these music .
1	love !
0	purchased accidentally !
0	while i love the cd , it would not play on our cd player for some reason . i tried it on my son player and it worked . the reason i wanted it wa so we could go to sleep listening to it . maybe it wa a problem with how it wa pressed ? i do not know . disappointed ! : (
0	her music is horrible and she support , endorses , and sleep with lilo brancato , a cop killer . if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective , daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society .
1	love ryan adam . and now i love taylor swift . i bought both cd !
0	all the song started sounding the same le than half way through . sad , because we really liked him on the show .
1	this is a wonderful soundtrack for a beautiful and thoughtful show . highly recommended that you see the show . currently playing in lahaina , maui , hawaii .
0	well , keysha cole is a well loved and respected artist , however , if you like her cd then you will love the real woman to woman which is a book dedicated to woman from all walk of life . this is not a book to shove religion down anyones throat , it is a book of encouragement and strategy for the everyday woman to conquer everyday problems/issues woman face . here is the link & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/woman-to-woman-spiritual-strategies-for-the-everyday-woman/dp/1484096304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > woman to woman spiritual strategy for the everyday woman < /a >
0	sample track sounded great , but when you listen to the entire cd it is one monotonous song after another . had high hope for this , but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune . probably will give it away if i can find someone who want it .
1	excellent to listen and relax or utilize for meditation into the salvation of christ for u all . help you with your time speaking to god one on one . perfect for catholic or any other follower of jesus .
0	bought this from amazon .the song are not in original order that wa on album , buy the original .if you can much better
0	lousy quality recording , you really have to be a die hard zappa fan to like it . i would also say it is best to listen to after 6 or 7 beer .
0	i for some reason do not like this song at all , i find it very annoying . how do i delete this song off my play list . lol
0	wack
0	i hate that anyone think this is burl ives . listen to the other song on this album . listen to the classic from the original animated how the grinch stole christmas . the singer name wa thurl ravenscroft .
1	it is great , i love the whole cd
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
1	i did not grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly african american church that i grew up in but listening to it now make me wish i heard stuff like this earlier . beautiful lyric and it is all lifting up the name of jesus christ .
1	for most of u who are familiar with bob baldwin body of work , the latest release - all in a day work , is simply brilliant . the opening song - a new york minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic baldwin . if you have bobbaldwin.com , try playing funkin for jamaica and then can you feel it , from the latest release . both are vocalized by tonni smith . for anyone in doubt , please - you are invited to go back and give brazil chill another listen . you will be glad you did , that is all i have to say . brazil chill is just a brilliant a the others . i am building up my collection of baldwin cd until have a many a i can get . if you have never seen bob baldwin perform - this is the icing on the cake . i can attest to that ! he is a true professional , a skilled artist and band leader and fantastic performer !
1	you will not be sorry , the song is enchanting- carefully moving from beginning to end , and taking u on a smooth ride through a sweet melody .
0	i thought karaoke lyric came with the music . i would buy more if i knew the lyric came with it a in other karoake music
1	i have been looking for some inspiration today , and i found it online at amazon .
0	this is my favorite cd however , the vinyl arrived scratched and i have yet to be able to actually play it without it skipping through most the song . i wa extremely disappointed .
1	not a good a the first one , but sequel rarely are . it is good none the le .
1	love this cd . a great mix of fun and serious ballad .
0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan . but this cd just suck . the music is great a usual , . but the lyric will lose you . there are two song on this cd that are ok , . but just ok. they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again . the rest of the lyric are just hogwash . they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all . erg : ay caramba , one note samba , la la la la bamba .. or jolly springtime , oh the jolly springtime , in the merry month of may , oh the heavenly hour , oh the come again day . or the bird is on the wing , the bell is about to ring , the big girl she is about to sing , today , today , today . the opening song today , today , today is a horribly conceived song , . infantile rhyming pattern , melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing . perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore . i do not know , . but i had to listen to this cd 4 time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about .
1	just a great love song
0	i bought this thinking since it her first christmas cd . i wa very disappointed . her range of voice ha changed a lot . she sound nasally and scream a lot in some of the selection . terrible !
1	nate dogg took p-funk and funk to a whole new level with his smooth blue jazz vocal yes sir no musician man can sing like nate dogg or even come close or near or even simaler
0	not sure the guy is signing , but it is not brett young , that is for damn sure ! ekkk
1	very good song
1	al stewart did some good work , only a few song had airplay . peter white wa the guitarist . a must for any 70s-80s playlist .
0	dear sir or madam , i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd . however , it must be good to use the right half of our brain , which is usually not used .
1	just what i needed to get into the spirit of the holiday . absolutely love it . so nice and mellow . highly recommended .
0	i hate the song sweet home alabama . kid rock combined this song with that now i can not get it out of my head . not that sweet home alabama is a bad song but i have heard way too many time . i grew up in mississippi and i wa worn out on the song by time i wa five .
1	i have this on an lp record and finally found it here . the entire collection is great fun with the monster singing their own song .
1	great
1	this cd is so relaxing when i am drifting off to sleep . rain is my favorite nature sound , so you can imagine how often i use this cd . the sound quality is exceptional . i could not be happier !
1	excelent damn donna u did it again u came through with a very empowering and inspirational song without being cheesy or to religious something i needed at this point in my life thank you i love you a life long fan
0	love waylon , but this wa a little bit of a dissappointment .
1	liked it when i wa a kid . cool .her version of michael jackson . almost exact . now i am blown by it . she ha such a way about her . no wonder prince and quincy jones and whitney houston and all the rest admire her talent .
1	nice
0	because the song cut where the explicit word would go . i wish i could get a refund , i ended up buying the explicit version instead
0	i am not a big a fan of king los a i am of los . when he wa doing mixtapes before becoming king , he wa the truth . this album is a let down .
0	not my type of music .
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band , that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war . this song and it lyric are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience , and a shame to the troop especially those who have served in combat . per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self control , and were mostly just complacent killer .
0	prime music is worthless . i am not renewing next year since i can not download prime song for free to my computer . i paid for this , tutorial say you can download song to your pc , but your s * app will not let me . and on top of this , i hate this song .
1	love this song !
0	no , this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since . this or that record . ( usually wheel on a gravel road , which everyone seems to worship ) and i wa really so disappointed because she a ) mumble b ) slur or c ) is not a good a she wa on car wheel . true , i have always liked lucinda . in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor , not always brilliant , but always heartfelt and sincere , providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country , blue and rock . her life ha not always been easy , which is reflected in her voice . in this , her latest release , i feel that everything go wrong . it is a double cd , only 7 track on each record , most of them way too long , a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it . sure , she mumble , but that is not really the main problem . she ha always mumbled , all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and strong . it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word . what make this album such a pain to listen to , is the music itself . the complete lack of new tune . to be honest i feel i have heard it all before . in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song - door of heaven , i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember , and the final track faith and grace is just a 13 minute jam session gone horribly wrong . there is even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory , where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad . some review praise her sound , which is stripped down and pretty basic . to me it sound flat , uninterested and stale , a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music . it is the sound of old beer , tired muscle and autumn rain . it is the sound of indifference . could have been mark knopfler . could have been leonard cohen . could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job . ha lucinda finally lost it ? have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll ? this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway 20 , and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong , something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it ? i liked her previous album , where she had more than enough song to make it a double . i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel . ( although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so ) . and in a world where good and original songwriter are few and far between , i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her . this one , however , wa just a big yawn to me .
0	what i simply and always say , is that when a artist ha to come out with a song , they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice . for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r & b voice and sound in her music , it actually ha not actually drove the point home . her song without me , with kelly roland and missy elliot , the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song . i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia , while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound , or something that ciara would make . i definitely wa not that impressed with the song , and it definitely is fantasia low point . song : d+
0	very poor album . there is a lacking of instrument , basic drum . very unsophisticated .
0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out 30 year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mar hotel and have to say that while i am a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp . it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp . my old mobile fidelity japan pressed 30 year old copy sound much more natural and is superior in almost every way . in fact i panicked and bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful seller a few day later . earlier last year mofi wa supposed to re-release this album on lp but decided not to at the last minute and friday music picked up the licensing right instead . this reissue is not all bad though , a i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich throughout the recording and the lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at 180 gram . it wa pressed at rti in california and very good quality control standard were obviously taken by the staff that produced this recording .
1	very good
1	i absolutely love this song which manages to be both depressing in a strangely end of the world kind of way and keep you interested
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
1	i love this song !
1	well done . well done .
0	poor sound track . these is a very loud drum in the background that distracts from the very good violin music . if the mixing wa better this would have been a fantastic track . unfortunately i did not hear the drum in the very short sample you hear when buying on amazon .
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different picture of the eight doctor . they should have name it dr. who and daleks calendar . almost all the picture are from the peter crushing movie or comic book-like picture . there is only one of tom baker and one of john petwee . this calendar should be only for major dr. who and dalek fan .
0	i just came here to read the description , trying to figure out why this showed up on a prime search for christian music . three is nothing christian about it . if anything it is new age .
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic , garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice . the title track , some are lake , is the strongest with it narrative of lost young love . the band next album , cloak and cipher is even better .
0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time , and one of my favorite artist a well . so , i wa so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song . but , i wa horribly disappointed when i heard this song . i really expected better from her than this ! in the past , i would have bought a shania cd without bothering to preview it first because i knew that it would be really good , if not excellent . when shania finally release her next cd , i will definitely preview it first , and if it is a bad a today is your day , i may not even bother buying it .
0	this is the worst description on the south i have ever heard my recommendation to any true southern is do not by this disgusting garbage i can not package it up fast enough to get it out of my house .
0	i love the album , but skip this loud , over-the-top , obnoxiously sung song every time . it is definitely something bad . bad for my ear .
1	excellent new music
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song . i gave the cd two star because it wa made by springsteen .
1	the majestic song dead or alive open this 1981 album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides , jim goodwin , peter muny & robert medici . alone worth the price of the album , this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet line of john gatchell . a live version with a significantly different feel appears on & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/comes-alive/dp/b001ijz188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > come alive < /a > . fighter pilot is another frenzied track where the bomberettes provide frisky background vocal whilst cales voice & viola rule on the multi-layered wilson joliet . eerie & gothic , street of laredo is a slow brooding piece with strange percussive sound effect that would not seem out-of-place in the work of edgar varese . equally downtempo , strange time in casablanca ha surrealistic lyric and a psychedelic texture . the highly experimental title track is a strange atonal affair dominated by the french chant of honi soit qui mal y pense , stab of high-pitched backing vocal and the weird wailing of dissonant synths & guitar . normality return with the mournful & melodious riverbank that reach a crescendo before fading out on enchanting instrumentation ; it recall the gentler side of & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/wrong-way-up/dp/b000002lnb/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > wrong way up < /a > , cales 1990 collaboration with brian eno . russian roulette rock hard in the & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/slow-dazzle/dp/b0013n47n4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > slow dazzle < /a > & nbsp ; manner and the album concludes with magic & lie , a striking blend of classical and rock that expires on the last gasp of shuddering drum pattern . honi soit is an uneven album and not amongst cales most accessible .
0	did not like the way it wa sung . fortunately it wa free because i certainly would not choose to buy it .
1	this is perfect rendition . i found this song because it wa written about in a book i wa reading and i wanted it . i had also heard it on the radio and wa looking for the perfect rendition and this is it .
0	not what i wa expecting , quite the opposite of what i wa hoping from this collection - looking for upbeat and postive
0	this soundtrack left off the only song i enjoyed from the movie . i guess i should have read the song list
1	great album with a list of quality song .
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the 70 and 80 . while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big band incarnation , woody brought a pretty decent band along a well , even though he wa entering the last decade of his life . amazing guy , amazing version of la fiesta . starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time ( were they all rolands ? ) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody , there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle : shrieking trumpet , a nifty tiberi solo , and awesome dynamic . a good a version a you will find anywhere .
0	not a good listening song for the holiday . voice is too rough .
1	listen to it so much , had to order another one ! want to make sure it doe not wear out !
0	stevie is always good .
0	not the same sound a the original version . sound like a different singer ! yuck .
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i did not do my research . i give this album a 2 because it ha a couple new track , but there are only 7 and most are from his free mixtape . you can get his mixtape so far gone for free , online which ha 17 track and is a lot better . it ha good track flow , great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape . i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity .
0	this is a bootleg release from dubious source . i have no idea why amazon even allows this to be listed , but do yourself a favor and save your money . there is no legitimate issue of this 2-fer . if you see this release , it is a bootleg .
1	awesome and funny
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening - and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book , little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience . not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale . but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection , i get a bit of the heebie-jeebies .
1	i wanted more of their debut album and got it . oh , of course it is not just rehash , but it is more of -and improvement on- their excellent sound , voice , beat , lyric . loved it upon first listen .
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary : buy of simply find it on you tube
0	can not stand the voice , or the inst1rumentals in the back . i mean , whats the refund policy ? gad !
0	it sound like she wa making it up a she went along .
1	i like it . just what we expected .
0	if you are looking for something to help you sleep , this is not it . the 30 second preview here sound peaceful ( and almost hypnotic to me ) but the full version ha some strange element . a the other reviewer said , it doe have a lot of static . it sound like . popping noise , or something to that effect . very strange .
1	excellent work of art . she is on target with every song . seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative , bad girl image . some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question , this is a top quality production .
1	i love this cd . every single song . it is one of my all time favorite . i feel like a couple of the song are straight out of my life . highly recommend !
0	love greg , hate this song . own 40 to 50 this one should never been recorded . should return it , but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button . lousum
1	older style music , which i like better .
0	while i am a berlin fan , i wanted to go back while listening to these song in the car . i should have read closely - these are not the original . while the are good , they are not the same . time to replace/repurchase with the original .
1	i like the music
1	posiblemente la cancin m famosa de don omar , el cantante bein conocido . hay que comprarlo ; esta versin e impresionante . el mejor de la versiones hoy .
1	awesome cd
0	horrible annoying sound . i disliked this tremendously . i kept hoping the sound would change but wa just the same 10 second sound over and over .
0	im a big cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to cornell , soundgarden , audioslave , and totg fan everywhere . this should be a justin timbercrap song .
1	great price ! product a stated ! no problem !
1	great metal song
1	strangely oriental but totally captivating with those five note in the opening . absolutely love this one . keep it up tom rhett !
0	unsuccessful purchase .
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut ! this is a bluesy , brassy ala david rose stripper sounding , slow paced arrangement . some of you will like it . i am biased , however . the original use string for the main line ( this us brass ) and brass for the aside or counterpoint . it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent . this aint that cut ! for those who relish soundtrack music this , to me , is like the hugo montenegro version ( arrangement ) of the man from uncle theme . i do not even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme . i like jerry goldsmith original version . everything else is pale . the i spy album are available but at $ 22 that is out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it , it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set , which is a lovely accordion and string based song . this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling .
0	i liked this song until i watched the video . come on . then robin thicke got twerked on by miley . ugh . while his wife played it cool for a while , eventually she left him . and finally he say he ha addiction issue . am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where the singer/actors personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song/movie ? ( see : anything by amy winehouse ; all thing brad pitt , gwyneth paltrow or rihanna )
0	a rehash of very old willie . 50 poorly recorded cut of the early year . total disappointment . look for better collection .
1	first cd i have bought in a long time . sturgill simpson should have won a grammy for this album in my opinion , and i am not even that much into country music . this guy is in a genre of his own , and it kick a $ . can not wait to see what he come up with on his next album .
0	did not purchase this book either or whatever it is - did not purchase this one . can not rate it . sorry .
0	this is an original artist remake . if you want the original version of this song click here > & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/one-more-try/dp/b002sz2z80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > one more try < /a >
1	i like this version of the song . it is very smooth and sweet . the harmony is gentle and it lyric are thoughtful .
1	here is a frank sinatra single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago . ol blue eye recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his heyday at capitol record . released in january of 1957 the tune spent 19 week on the chart and peaked at # 15. the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo . this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it before . this is the original hit recording .
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) . i am not sure how legit this package is . his voice and guitar playing are passable . he kind of sound like a higher-register steve earle . his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original . by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge , he obliterates the intended goofy fun . the same go for dirty world . the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor . that is completely missing . he doe not miss altogether . handle with care make it a a slower-tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar . hey , if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune , i would think he rocked , but a whole record of this one guy is murder , and his anonymity ( not even a wilbury codename ) , make it a bogus enterprise . i would label this ` for completists only , but i am a wilburys completist , and this is $ 11.99 i wish i could get back .
0	what a horrible song to write about the awful deed you did . innocent child were involved ! the lyric are atrocious . i know that because i read them online . you can never understand a word this woman say .
1	leon cut up , adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune . the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album . also , you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly , stylized singing style on many of his recording ( not that there is anything wrong with that ! ) it is just a refreshing change for his fan .
1	i still do not know what this song is about , but there is certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the song . the tune is catchy and the lyric are powerful . if you do not believe me , watch the video .
0	saw them perform on a talk show and thought i might like them . oh well .
0	not that good , it is a rip off .
0	paid for it but never downloaded
1	top gun
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind & fire . this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone - young and old - get up a move .
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song , not bing crosby . it is still a good verison , it is just not bing crosby .
0	i have been a jewel fan for a long long time . i saw jewel before she became famous for piece of you and instantly fell in love . i loved her style , her voice , her word - everything . while piece of you will always be my favorite album , i still found solice in all the others - until now ! what wa she thinking . i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar , speaking to the crowd with her song . her concert were intimate . when spirit came out , she added a band to her act , and while i wasnt thrilled , i could deal with it because at least she wa still writing those deep lyric that made me shiver at time . then about 8 mo . ago i went to see jewel play and i wa so happy to see that she had ditched the band and wa back to playing with just her and her guitar ! so now , 8 mo . later , i fear that girl is gone completely ! i never thought jewel would sell out and write such bland , on the surface lyric and pimp herself to an audience that love the poppy meaningless song of britney spear ! at first when i saw the video for intuition , i could not believe it wa jewel ! then i thought well this song seems to be putting down those who sell out . so i thought that maybe this song wa the only one of it kind on the album , but it wasnt . with the song intuition - jewel is a hyprocrit because she ha sold herself to just cash in .
1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest . this is a great song for lover .
1	superb !
1	this is one of those perfect single it is so simple but , so close to flawless dave gahan vocal even the 1980s synth keyboard sound all work to create a flawless single that still to this day stand the test of time ! a must all around 10/10
0	there wa not enough info to convert file for play on win medium player . could not find file on my computer
1	i like this album it is great . i am 10 year old and i love this album . all of the beat are really great and the lyric are really great and 50 cent is a really good rappper and i just love this cd cause it is so good . this is what rap music is all about , really good beat and really good lyric and really good rapping . 50 cent is the best rapper ever , i listen to this cd every day after school while i am eating my snack pack and watching sister sister on the wb . it is good my mom bought it for me for my birthday along with justin timberlakes new cd . that is great too i love both cd but 50 cent is especially good .
1	love every aspect of this ! great film ! great soundtrack ! top notch stuff . if you have not seen or heard this , your missing out !
0	this wa a gift for a friend , i never listened to it , but she loved the music .
1	if you want a variety of beethoven music , this is an excellent selection . beautiful , beautiful music . relaxing , uplifting , moving . it just doe not get any better !
1	another hit .
1	love it . hate it . it is going to live on a one of the greatest album of all time . forever remembered a the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music wa , ( some of u knew . it wa called the underground scene ) i mean let face it , if anyone remembers 1991 ( and i do not mean being 8 ) you know that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away . mainstream rock wasnt supposed to be that good . not at that time anyways . it changed the mainstream . for the better ? i dunno , . basically hmmm , i wonder what they will like next remember the spin doctor ? bush ? yea . a far a the underground go . i have never read any underground legend say anything bad about nirvana . biafra , rollins , joey ramone , iggy . heck iggy used to go to nirvana show and go insane . if anything ive heard all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspiration to nirvana music . yea , even jello . bottom line is this : they put out 3 lp , 1 b-side lp , a acoustic album that blew everyone away a 2nd time . and basically had everyone talking . act like korn , system of a down , tool , manson , blink , where are they gon na be in 10 year . more importantly how are they gon na be remembered ? i have no idea , but i know how nirvana is going to be remembered for the next billion . this album is the reason why . nevermind .
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album , 0304 , take notice that all artist : writer , actor , musician , painter , etc. , etc , have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate . artist like jewel have to project different image twenty-four seven , whether it is their look and/or work . moreover , change can sometimes be difficult to accept , but that is life . nothing stay the same , everything change . however , that is how the entertainment business operates too . artist are product , pawn , of an industry that control their every move . just enjoy the music and have fun !
0	i heard a lot of good thing about this album so i bought it only to become disappointed . many of the song seem forced and repetitive if other hit they have had . i have it an honest listen several time before actually returning it-for me , it wa that bad . about the only good thing i can say is that blink 182 ha an awesome drummer .
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song . dated late eighty early ninety production ha not dated too well . this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and cole were at da top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio .
0	wow , another album from brmc where they can not decide what kind of music they want to make : rocker or slow , drawn out ( and imo dull ) folk song . i really liked war machine & aya . those i bought and enjoyed . i will be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again : )
0	stupid .
1	it sound great and the price wa right
0	i wa really hoping for that sound they make . loved other album of theirs . but this one is different . it good . but i do not care for it . it wa a great buy .
0	poor quality mixing . poor quality sound . save your $ ! look elsewhere .
1	another get out of your seat raise your hand and praise god song . this song touch the heart and the spirit
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch . i would seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he would written the song for him . it wa kind , and touching , and the song itself wa great . look for another year at massey hall , i am !
1	air return with love 2 - their best work , in my opinion , since 1998s moon safari . the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound ( do the joy ) and synth-driven scope ( be a bee ) . alternatively , the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop-tune to date with sing sang sung . with this type of contrast ( notable from quite an early stage on the album ) one ha to expect some surprise along the way . do the joy - an odd track to start the album with . nonetheless , a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel . the song sound like something from 10,000 hz legend , with it is multi-layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect . not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least . 7/10 love - once again , not your typical second song . it hold a sense of simplicity though , and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice , soft-like piece with a great chord progression and melody ( the glockenspiel add an awesome feel ) . sound like something you would hear at the end of moon safari - especially the later half of the piece . it wasnt my favourite at first , but after a few listens it grew on me . 7/10 so light is her football - the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic . the music sound pocket symphony era , with the song being driven by piano and hovering string . i heard ( or read ) somewhere that this will be the second single off the album . an odd decision i believe , but who know - maybe it need more listens . the song seems a little bland at some point , but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view . 6/10 be a bee - definitely not a song you would think air would produce . with it is western-like feel , the song sound like something off a surfing documentary . it is fun but also lack differentiation ( on all front ) . it could have done with some structuring overhauling . not the greatest song on the album but hey - that is something you will probably be use to at this stage , right ? 6/10 missing the light of the day - an interesting tune with some rather unique sound . if you have ever seen air live you would know what i am talking about . they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set , and this song is a pretty good indicator of that . if you have heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo-alternatuve twist . nothing overly exciting , but a worthwhile listen . 7/10 tropical disease - the album longest tune and one of the best , in my opinion . contrary to what i have mention so far with regard to lyrical absence , i have always been one to fancy air instrumental track . i believe it take a higher-level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience , depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical-presence . the song sound like two turned into one . the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee . a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau , reminiscent of something off talkie walkie . 8/10 heaven light - definitely one of the album standout track . itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la . probably the album most chill-out number , with it is swirling progression ( especially towards the middle half ) and heavenly vocal scene . my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune . 10/10 night hunter - another instrumental track with a great beat to it . cross the electronica soundscapes of 10,000 hz legend and add the piano-driven feel of ( the majority of ) pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down-tempo-like rhythm . a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air . 9/10 sing sang sung - well what can we say about this ! easily air most accessible pop-song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist . with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album , this number is easily one of the best on the entire album . simple yet so effective in it delivery . there is just enough contrast between chorus , verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel . if you are going to get someone into this album , nay , air themselves , this might be a good starting point ! 10/10 eat my beat - one of the shortest on the album . the song is a good break from the ambient/instrumental-driven latter half of the album . with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece , it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest . 8/10 you can tell it to everybody - an awesome chill-out track to begin the closing stage of the album . once again , i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one . ` new star in the sky ( chanson pour solal ) would have this a it is little sister . acoustic and laid-back in it is approach , this tune is a near perfect night song . with it is distorted harmonica interlude , it is bound to sooth whatever sorrow you are experiencing and take you to a calmer place . 9/10 african velvet - whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer , african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album . with it is hand-picked guitar segment , and it is front-line horn melody , it is a perfect way to close of this special album . with a smooth bass line , hinting the like of la femme dargent , velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note . a great way to close off love 2 . 8/10 i gave this effort from air four star in the end . but i am not ruing out a higher score . it is definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really soak in . not a accessible a their earlier album , but for anyone who is been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient-masters , your wait is over . if i could relate it to any album previously released , i would say 10,000 hz legend . on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill-out tune , but on the other ` love 2 ha the making of attracting a whole new market/denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe . give it a go and do not give up after a few listens . itll grow on you . trust me !
0	this album wa a huge letdown . it is way too melodic and popish / commercial light rock . being a huge fan of all that remains , owning all of their other album & having gone to their show , this album wa a major disappointment . melodic can be cool if it is still heavy like on their older album but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me . i do not like the direction they have gone in . i liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it wa dissatisfactory . i do not recommend this album to hardcore and metalcore fan .
1	dynamic
0	ruined a perfectly good song
0	this album is 1 star because most of the song are unlistenable . i do not enjoy listening to this album . i do not recommend this album . addy .
1	fun , upbeat song to put you in a good mood and make you want to dance .
1	i wa suprised that this song wa good . i wasnt expecting much from an american idol person , but this song proved me wrong . hopefully the rest of his music is a good a this song
0	what the others say is true . i bought this cd back in the early ninety . i soon discovered it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp . no stereo and one song play faster than it should . i have the original mercury stereo lp ( all track were stereo except one ) . just an fyi , the stereo lp version of please do not talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version . you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube . search for diane ray stereo .
1	i wa at these show . to have a physical piece of history that i wa apart of is priceless . y & t never fails to put on a phenomenal show . they sound a good today a when i saw them in 85 .
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord ! this cd is astoundingly well-crafted , every note seems perfectly placed , the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music . generally , this is soft , warm , lulling music , but it doe not put you to sleep . toxic girl is catchy , jangly , and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced . sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it . there is a real soothing quality here , though , that can not be denied . fan of low and air should be quite pleased .
0	this remake of dylan music is almost unrecognizable and disturbing to the ear . it wa sad . a i like ben sidrans style but this is a joke and i wa super sad i ordered it . mr sidran is from my home town and i wanted to support him , the local review were favorable . but it is awlful and i will put it in to my resale or charity box for the next drop off trip. < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/dylan-different/dp/b002upq1q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > dylan different < /a >
0	the cd did not play . i purchased volume 1 and volume 2 but volume 2 doe not play and the paper and receipt were not saved . highly disappointed .
0	where is the woodwind obbligato ? the break strain ? and what is with the stinger ? ! this is not the real go u !
1	i heard this song on the radio and loved it . it really make you think if jesus wa never born we would not have christmas . jesus is the reason for the season and this song reminds u all of that .
1	another great celtic thunder cd
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill , over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part , not a high point in an illustrious career .
0	it pain me to see so many 1 star review coming from dylan own fan base . i have been a fan for over 40 year , and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered . bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now , but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time . this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated , but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place , and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate . the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa , which should have been released a a limited edition x-mas single for this charitable cause . his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice . he change all the arrangement of his song during live show , because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded . there come a time in everyones life , when it is time to get off the stage , whether you are a doctor , heavy equipment operator , or in this case an musician . i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that , and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career , without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter .
1	i can listen to this one over and over again .
0	never received it ! had previous review for other song but only noticed 17 at that time . now i see all these . just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comment apply : - ( - had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh ! close to $ 100 worth of music never received !
1	found it very easy to purchase directly from my kindle , love it . look forward to purchasing more song in the future
0	well in short , not good at all , not my chemical romance style , if they felt like getting back to the basic at least go back to decent music like three cheer .
0	poor sound quality .
0	too pop , baby sounding .
1	this is a great song to start off your friday . i listen to it on the way to the office every friday morning . set the day to be a positive experience no matter how your day end . great song .
1	this song sound great on my kindle and roku ! i am so glad that i purchased it ! it wa definitely a great find !
0	why do you make me so happy and also want to to die on the same album ?
1	granddaughter love t
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect . it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good . a 101 string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus . preview it and judge for yourself .
0	original pressing of capitol the george , john , paul & ringo songbook ( 1971 , st-839 ) are on their tuscan red label . when stu phillips is not throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 track that comprise this set , he slows their tempo down to a dirge pace . the very last selection , bangladesh wa so unrecognizable i had to consult the playlist to find out what i wa listening to . or maybe that repetitive tabla shouldve tipped me off ? admiral halsey sound like a lullabye . it do not come easy is listless despite a fuzz guitar lick near the close . in stus hand , paul mccartney often disparaged long & winding road is more saccharine than a 200 packet box of sweet n low . hey jude and let it be are not much better . john lennon wa spared the phillips touch , probably because there wa no way to de-gonad the track from his & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/plastic-ono-band/dp/b000mvfgd8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > plastic ono band < /a > & nbsp ; lp . remember : the sound you make is muzak to my ear from how do you sleep on the & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/imagine/dp/b000mhv2v2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > imagine < /a > & nbsp ; album ? perhaps john wasnt addressing his former partner but the presumptive stu phillips . this collection of hypnotic elevator music is strictly for beatles completists and nurse ratched ( of & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/one-flew-over-the-cuckoo-s-nest/dp/0790732181/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > one flew over the cuckoo nest < /a > & nbsp ; fame ) . program- side one [ 2:48 ] here come the sun [ 4:30 ] hey jude [ 3:07 ] another day [ 2:20 ] let it be [ 3:18 ] the long and winding road side two [ 3:29 ] my sweet lord [ 4:59 ] uncle albert/admiral halsey [ 2:45 ] something [ 2:58 ] it do not come easy [ 4:01 ] bangla-desh total time : 34:15
1	great cd at bargain price .
1	i am sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i bought it for , but alan jackson just doe an exceptional job with it .
1	nice sound but you need a very quiet environment to listening yo yo ma
0	ken vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year old who run around screaming , kenny , are full of it . this album is anything but what i expected from the band . if you want a real starting line sound drop by my house sometime and i will show you some tape i have of them playing local show around here . you know , before they sucked . ok , so they do not suck , but they were far better before they released this cd . stay underground with song like gregs last day and the original leaving . good starting line , unlike this album
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep . i have yet to find that version for sale . this is not a good substitute in my opinion .
0	it is just a preference . it is not my cup of tea that is all . too heavy going for young child i think .
1	brandi is one of my all time favorite artist and this album doe not disappoint . i definitely recommend it to anyone who love great music .
1	this is a classic . anyone into hard punk should give this album a try . especially , good riddance is an amazing song . great precision and no mercy .
1	i have also been waiting for this cd for about 3 year now , and now that it is finally out . the anticipation is deffinatly worth it . i love this cd , it is just a amazing a i had expected . it is awsome . it is good no matter what type of music you usually listen to . it is a combinaiton or hip hop , and metal . it is an awsome combination . it is funny , adn serious . so nomatter wht your mood is you will enjoy it . i think that this cd ha just made my month . i got it the day it came out , and wouldnt have it any other way . go pick it up ! now !
0	i am a big van halen fan . but . this live album is a lttle too late . dave , dave , dave . wassup ? he had it together for the initial reunion tour , but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career . he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric , but rather talking , and mumbling his way through them . although not 100 % . he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them . his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama , show he can do better . but let spread some of the blame around . it is been a long time since i heard any live album recorded/mixed this badly . i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it . it is just atrocious ! everything is just muddled together , and blurry sounding . i am aware live is live , but what ? no mixing board at that venue ? no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio ? i am really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording . a bad a the finally result , i think it may have been way better with decent recording/mixing . after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit , i think this wa just slapped together with little effort , just to get something out there . sloppy effort by all involved . i am still looking for good quality sound/video recording of the initial reunion tour . this one aint gon na cut it . sorry .
1	manakin moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band waxing poetics , who were a regional favorite in the norfolk , virginia , area . it is a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind . highly recommended . wannabe singer , just try to learn the lyric on this one !
1	they got better with age !
0	sum 41 ha always been a band i looked down upon , their cd chuck really anti-impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would like it , and this album is very similar in that aspect . the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually . at least close to punk . but besides that nothing really appeal to me , rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk . i do not suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back .
1	awesome song
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song . first , there is the music : the song is fairly simply , yet build in a mid-80s era bob dylan style . nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song . the production is clean , with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal , exactly where is should be . the primary focus of the song is in the lyric . wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road , and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it . while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind , such a what is your name , what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair . i think that at the beginning of the song , it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song , but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him , and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone . really an accurate view of what the road can do to you , bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully , but from an entirely different perspective . worth the download , but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it .
1	wishbone ash ha always been a favorite of mine and these recording are exceptional in quality
1	i love folk acoustic guitar music and have listend to many artist . came across this song by robin bullock quite by accident on youtube . wa completely blown away . listened to it about 10 time before i could walk away from my computer . wish robin lived in the u so that i could have more chance of seeing him in concert .
1	great song !
0	maroon 5 ha joined the like of all the other modern day group . what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike . this may be fine for today youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value , but for u old classic rock people , i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice .
0	do not buy this . not the actual song and is only a partial 30 sec long .
0	this review is about the quality of the vinyl , not the quality of the music . my copy of this album skipped several time , most notably on the song deck dark . always in the exact same spot . a this is unacceptable , i had to send it back .
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is just the same 5 minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is too intense for a sleep aid .
0	god , what a letdown this wa . people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month , until they saw the tracklisting - the original record , b-sides that every already ha , the smart studio tape that everyone already ha ( and is not that good ) and a live cd that everyone already ha . then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage , meaning , a someone else ha already explained , compressed to hell so everything is the same volume ( loud ) and it hurt your ear , getting rid of many aural detail in the process . no doubt , the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing . i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver , a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer . however , they are kind of all over the place , which i suppose one should expect for rough mix - some drum are too loud ( lithium ) , some too buried in the mix ( breed , territorial pissing ) , etc . i wanted to love them , but overall i do not . i do prefer the vocal on there , a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic , and the bass sound like a bass . people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum . it is nothing i notice though . also , if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off , google sound city sappy . in the end , the boombox tape is definitely the gem here . much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere . really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would , in retrospect , be the calm before the storm . it is that much-fabled last innocence period . now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money - four cd , a dvd and a hardcover book for $ 109- $ 130+ , depending where you got ( get ) it . with the light out is currently around $ 40 here and you get three cd , a dvd and a softcover book . both have substantial packaging . with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it , like most of it . all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand , ha been released commercially . disc four replicates the dvd , which again , ha been available a a high-quality audio bootleg since time immemorial . plus , all the live b-sides are from this show , so those song appear three time on the set - what ? anyway , you can buy the deluxe for $ 20 and the dvd for $ 16 or so . what do you miss out on ? not much . not much . seriously , why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth ?
0	no heart , no feeling just strumming on his oud . i do not know what he wa improvising but it felt more like koord than hijaz
1	much better than i had hoped for ; the basic reason i purchased two additional cd of joes . can not go wrong here !
0	i could not get more than half way through really boring book . not only wa it boring but it jumped around in time between chapter . drove me crazy . begin 30 year ago then jump to present then back to 1822 to present back to 1822 back to present . the only thing keeping me going to the half way point wa waiting for something to happen . it never did so i gave up .
0	by far the worst s * i have heard in a long time . poser wan na be should just give it up . fail .
1	i love this tune , it my fav dance tune off all time , this tune should always be remebered and should be loved forever
1	ramsey lewis ha been a favorite of mine for a long time . if you like jazz buy this track and sit back and enjoy
1	thank you belinda for recording this song ! it is fun upbeat and showcase belindas vocal talent . just downloaded yesterday and have listened to the song about 20 time . make you feel good and it is so wonderful to have belinda put out another great pop hit ! a+
1	i love this song . anything featuring david byrne is going to be brilliant , never heard of this band/group before .
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood . the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song . it got so low at time i could not really make out the note . but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song . all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little , the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell . all well done . really enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and the old beatles song if i fell in love with you . very listenable and very relaxing .
1	the unique voice of bonnie tyler combined with the emotional presentation of the song lyric combine to make this a timeless and classic favorite .
0	this album is trash , this band completely copy and try to be gun n rose of the 1985-1989 era with the leather , boot and aviator . the lead singer of faster pussy in one video try to be axl in jungle with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelet and leather pant . dont buy this imposter junk , go get appetite for destruction by gnr and rock out . no one can ever be axl . the song try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [ being bad ] . also the lyric try to be like brett michael of poison and [ are awful ] . rock on
0	although a nice album musically , these mp3 track i downloaded were of poor quality , probably recorded from an old vinyl record . all track had click and pop , while some had actual hiss and skip ! i know there are better quality album out there because i have one of them .
1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest , most beautiful cd i have in my collection . buy it without hesitation . indescribably beautiful , intelligent , warm and well produced .
1	i play this to help rock my baby to sleep and she must find it so calming because it work every time : )
1	great cd by one of the top band around today .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
1	being a band nerd , i like listening to band music . this compilation is first rate , and i hope that student will ask their director to program on or more of these selection for an upcoming concert or festival . i hope director will take the time to listen and say to themselves yeah , my band can play this ! i first heard of stephen melillos music a a college student . i wa selected to play in the kkpsi/tbs national intercollegiate band in 1993 , and we performed his a walk in jurassic park . what awesome music ! i thought to myself , and it wa fun to play , too . i have performed some his music with my own band , and the player really enjoy the craft which mr. melillo put into his composition .
1	is a gift
1	great product delivered very fast
1	personally , i liked the original version of the song from the movie , but i love this version best !
1	love it !
1	this is my pick if you need a song to get you started on a long road trip to fight vampire , demon and werewolf .
0	i bought this song on itunes trying to respecect the copyright law however the import processing is confusing and i still have no idea how to put this on my computer . i thiink the system should be more user friendly because if i can not figure it out normal folk that use this service everyday ( like my parent ) who are le computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer .
1	great song
0	i do not see what everyone see in this dude . this album suck his beat are only appealing because of sampling . lyric are straight garbage a usual people wake up look behind poppy beat and mainstream appeal ! u wan na hear some real hiphop look for dude like elzhi and reks .
1	i remember when the four top were popular and i still love them today . soon my oldie favorite list will be at 150 !
0	i love the classic moonglows recording . so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl . oops - i downloaded i wa wrong and it wa completely not the original doo wop version of the song . this version ha a strong background track , it is highly produced , it is just off . this is just my taste , but the new version of the tune wa awful and not what i wa looking for at all . anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these .
1	. then you will love this . if you enjoy autotunes and song about being an independant woman who married for status , then what are you doing here ?
0	this song wither did not load on the player correctly or is only weekday the sample is . either way , i am not pleased with it at alp
1	this is ep loosely based on love in different form . my favorite track on it is and then therell be a light . also feature crash , body , self-knowledge , dependence and corp d amour .
0	do not expect too much . however , she wa somewhat better than others i have heard . wa okay , but disappointing . so-so client
1	enjoyed this album very much .
1	great soulful delivery on every song included in this project .
1	awesome reminder of the love of god !
0	this album is horrible . the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job , but david lee roth should be put out to pasture . i can not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance . problem : 1. david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa 1978. a such , he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly . 2. he only sings half of the lyric , the rest are spoken . 3. he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric . 4. he change up the tempo of the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly ( i.e . not singing ) . 5. he say a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward . 6. he us completely different lyric when a song break down quiet- think hot for teacher , panama , mean streats , etc . 7. while they made him sound good in the studio , david voice live is not good at all , he can barely sing . 8. if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album wa released , you will know what i am talking about . that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that i have ever heard . 9. he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse : i will sing it for you right this time . in other word , dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and i will wait which are the main reason i bought the album . horrible , horrible , and horrible . what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punks- at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime . do not buy this album unless you love disappointment .
1	i love this song , and amazon make it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dy or something in the middle of the download , all for free . see itunes , if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load , or your power go out , or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again , trust me , i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once . where a amazon is awesome cause it is all on your account , so you just log in and it is there , and it show that you payed the $ 1 for it so it is yours . even if you get a new phone , or ipod , or loose internet connection or whatever . your logged it , it is your account you payed for it , it all leagle , and it is yours , for like ever . : d in my own personal opinion i highly highly highly recomend you download song , and buy song from amazon.com verse buying it on itunes . c :
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
0	i would not buy this album . there is a track missing and the new dubbs in the speaking part are terrible !
0	i got this because it supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility . many of the example or story drag on waaaaaay to long .
1	i love this song because it is really catchy and fun and ha cute lyric . david archuleta win again . : )
1	i bought this uk edition of their debut album because it had extra track including boyfriend featuring snoop dogg ! i liked it !
1	love it
0	if it were not so badly warped it would be fantastic . maybe if you are lucky and get another batch . . .
1	wa a gift for a friend a and he love it
1	i thought this wa annoying at first-and it is . but it is much le annoying than most kid cd . it stand up to repeated play .
0	still trying to find out how i ordered this mp3 song i hat the way amazon music tried to take over my computer and start up this program every time i booted up . had to uninstall it from my computer . bad experience and product .
1	a advertised .
1	i really like the song , but it wa the toyota commercial she wa in , with the song , that had me . this is the first kelly clarkson song i have bought . look forward to trying more of her style of music . she doe sing the national anthem very well too . thanks !
0	i do not know if it is amazon fault , but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp3 is bad . too much treble , muddy in the midrange , and the bass is lacking , or maybe it is just overshadowed by the treble . listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ears- literally , not figuratively- hurt . i am so thankful for program like audacity ( sound manipulation program ) so i can balance it out myself , but i should not have to .
1	beautifull rendition of this song . soul and feeling from this talented young lady . a bit slower than the original which showcase jena beautiful voice .
1	great
0	i purchased this by accident . i do not like her music which is too explicit . i can not say i hate it , because that would put me on the fence with love/hate .
1	song i grew up with
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the price it is offered . i have no regret about this purchase .
0	a lot of people have praised this disc - but i am not one of them . this recording is many thing , but the soundtrack it is not ! despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also written by him . this disc ha the song that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score ! despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film background music . and the score is a significant element in any film . without the score , all this disc doe is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake . if , like me , you enjoy film score , then this disc is one you should skip .
0	worse song ever , with all of her success and talent and this is what she creates ? get a life .
0	i wa watching a bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought i wa watching snl . i had to listen to it later because it seemed so bad . it is horrible . next song will be blue solo cup . then motor oil . then oral-b toothbrush . this is the promotional song for the album . how bad are the other song ?
1	i love don meons music , but there are a few song that will not play . my favorite are i will say yes and the greatness of you
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike ( and try to avoid ) about hollywood production . terrible .
1	i love the arrangement on this collection . many of my favorite easter song with stirring instrumentation . a good collection to have .
1	awsome song
1	good
0	it skipped many time . i wa given a full refund .
0	alright , this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review . it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a 5 year old most likely did . the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not know ! that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first 3 time . the final you do not know ! end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer . do not throw away your money , and if it is on the radio change the station !
0	could not add it to a class slideshow presentation . only streamed . boo
0	terrible sound quality ! i bought the vinyl and i barely even recognized the song because it wa so warped . dont buy the vinyl version . even worse , i missed the return date . i am stuck with it .
0	there is only one song on this cd worth listening to . i recoment getting the mp3 version of tarzan boy and ignore the rest of the song .
0	i never ordered or received this . why is this listed under my purchase , is it just one song or the whole album ?
0	will not play on my android . ripoff ? !
0	not so great .
1	good music throughout . always favor original song . mix up tempos/styles- appeal to all age . she is a really good singer . glad to see her doing so well and overcoming a rough time with positive forward sailing .
0	not what i expected
0	this is not the song i wanted , and i do not know how to download it . i miss the old day , when you bought a song and then you actually owned it . how can i embed this in a powerpoint ? how could i use it in a photo slideshow ? grrr . im hopelessly left behind by technology and im only 33
0	not close to his best , just pedestrian , a money making pot boiler .
0	wow . i wa hoping for more like his first 2 album and wa severely disappointed . nirvana . really ? not great listening .
1	i listen to the mp3s for enjoyment but also for training purpose on the guitar . so it go without saying that quality is paramount .
1	i really wish they would do more cover . this turned into an amazing project for their fan . thank you shinedown !
0	wow i wish they stop playing this garbage on the radio by now ! even for a 8 minute song ? this guy is just desperate to keep his career going . he need to look himself in a mirror cause the music flatout suck .
1	great sound
1	perfect
0	i had pre-oredered this album on itunes , and could not wait to get it . i first fell in love with bright eye when i heard their album i am wide awake , it is morning . the gentle , yet strong instrument and focus on vocal had a large calming effect on me , which is why i grew to love bright eye . however , this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered . most of the song rely heavily on electric instrument and a distorted sound that come off a angry instead of thought provoking . i would not recommend this to anyone .
0	i have always thought that the best of bon jovi wa richie sambora a he show u in his two previous job . but on this album i see the worst of the song of bon jovis last album . on the other hand , the sound of this cd is very noisy , like the style of some album of the 70 . in short , and for not doing more blood , this cd can be summarized a a couple of good song from a handful of bad and noisy song .
0	pretty lame .
1	i like the rythm
0	not what i expected . not my type of music but it wa free .
0	nothing good worth mentioning but picture perfect ! .that tracc with brandy wa o.k an dumb s * t shouldve been without snoop an blacc ty .
0	i love this album , but this get 2 star . it would be great if one time i would get a record from amazon that did not skip at all . last two i have purchased have had bad skipping spot .
0	i bought this because it popped up a an ad on a youtube video of the song , but it wasnt the same version a in the video . i deleted it .
1	lin-manual miranda is an outstanding composer ! he is a remarkable man making history on the stage with history a his inspiration and a musical form that allows much information in the shortest time !
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar & electronics work . i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style . so far i have had only moderate success . hybrid fart ( that name should have been my first clue , if we are even talking about a bekker cd ) everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant ( not really the language of love , is it ? ) or perhaps not so wordy . for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake . and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german , i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker recording . i could not find his name anywhere on the cd package . granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i did not look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart . i think mr. bekker ha a bit more class than that . so if you are looking , like me , for something along the line of his sitar & electronics cd , which is a true gem , then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction . the music struck me a 21st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud . sort of like the end of day rough mix . until you or i can find a good successor to sitar & electronics , let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer . a far a i know there are 2 release by each band , all 4 record are a magnificent journey on their own . if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s & e , please , please leave me the information in a comment to my review .
0	first of all , let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day , i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the 80 stuff . in fact , chicago 16 is one of my favorite album by the band . and 17 is an album that they have every right to be very proud of . and while 18 and 19 were just cranking-out-the-formula album for them at that point , they at least had some huge hit single , which wa really all the band wa about at that point . by the time they got to 21 in 1991 , both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa ( should have ) been it for the that period of the band . they then spent the next 15 year releasing various compilation , live and christmas albums- some of which were considered part of the canon and some not- so that we could get to the point in 2006 where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx . i , like a lot of fan , were very curious to see what this new album would bring . a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound . a - even if completely coincidental - use of triple x hinted a something edgy . instead , they inexplicably tried to revive the 80 sound of the band . i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band , but even if they could have come up with another 17 , the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in 2006. there could have been another hard to say i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway . so why even attempt to go down that path ? who were they trying to reach with this album ? and , worst of all , the attempt failed . there is not much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone . the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired . one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place . it doe serve to make weak album like 13 , xiv and 21 seem not so bad in retrospect , though . what chicago need to do- what almost all of their fan would like to see- is a return to experimental and jazz-rooted sound of the earliest stuff . sure , lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the 70 , but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly-written tune in an interesting manner . ( and let u be honest . even a lot of the material on their early record were not great song . but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting . ) itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album . or maybe they do not want to . which is fine , but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album .
1	great
0	the cd control system get 5 star hand down . the problem is that there are only 16 track although the cd ha 17. track # 2 is missing when you download it .
0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter , mostly a good cover band with a livewire , athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock . probably a great bar band when they started out . i saw them twice in their early day , when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best . loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band . unfortunately , whatever vocal talent he ever possessed , ha long since evaporated . david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalist of the 70 were bad , nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a they get older - he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within 10 foot of a microphone . worse still , he clearly know it , and rather than try harder , he doe not even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct . lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir . inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public !
0	nickelback essentially sum up everything that is wrong with the music industry today . what else can i say ? this stuff is so bad it make me go cross-eyed .
1	i have chosen this song to be played at my funeral upon my passing . i love the old fashioned hymn and patriotic music .
1	have always loved this song- more the music than the word . it seems to be the only one by gotye that i like though .
1	the song is catchy and fun . amy winehouse wa a very talented singer and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song .
1	brilliant a always !
0	honestly this album is really disappointing . i will say to you just go back to alaska and explore your root again ! take care !
0	i love these song but the quality of the album wa awful . every song clip horribly , especially demon . please release a better version .
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp , it is the live version from the chuck berry film , hail ! hail ! rock n roll . it is misleading to label it re-mastered when it is a different version from the original .
1	bought this one when it wa new . a great double album of a neglected band . just listen to budd johnson for a start . the great drummer alvin burroughs , shorty baker and the young mr. b , are also on hand . grab it quickly .
0	sound like it wa recorded during tuesday night music club ( i know it wasnt ) and that is not my favorite era of hers . sound sorta been-there-done-that . hope the rest of the detour cd is better .
1	love
0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here . nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion . his guitar solo are good , however his voice sound weak ( due to age i guess ) and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band . i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash . he lack the inspiration playing with his band . he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby/nash to step up his vocal . i wa disappointed with this cd/dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while ( maybe ) .
0	it is good
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now . i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current . i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well . closer without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track . illumination is without question the worst . there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr. groban . his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day . his voice is unlike any other . he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer . yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst . in some way , i wish it wa never been released . for it tarnish his previous accomplishment . i do not blame mr. groban for this , even though he chose his producer , but i do blame his advisor and most of all , the producer . rick rubin is no david foster . even though i am not a personal fan of david foster - his arrogance is not very becoming . his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable . and with this said , maybe he deserves to be arrogant . mr. groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song . the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer . redirection is needed for the next album . heck , if it wa me , i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best . many of the standard which mr. groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album . yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage . this is where the experienced writer in the rock , pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other . in the end , this is just my opinion , among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour . let u hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue . i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album . my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song . without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album . this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination . i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr. groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy .
1	love this song !
1	traditional country !
0	could not stomach much of this . slow , lifeless , abomination of the real symphony . depressing .
0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep . you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace . when her voice leaf you assumably asleep for 20 minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire . the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect a the fire in the fireplace . fortunately it wa only a 99 cent wasted expenditure . there are some good sleep aid recording available but this is not one of them .
0	i think that i must have got a bad copy because this sacd sound awful ! it sound like a cd from 1985
0	j. walsh said what i thought about this album . huey lewis and the news were a great pop-rock , new wave sounding band , they did more blue in the past , now they are trying their take on soul . this is not the huey lewis and the news we all love . huey please try to do another rock album before retiring , i think you can still do it .
1	while clearly a tremendous technical achievement , this 2cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression - both explosive and contemplative . i love it !
0	i am very disappointed ! the wording on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original 80 artist . it is not ! it is a mix sung by a wedding singer/cruise line type of band . is it even legal for a cd to be published with remake of original artist song without the permission of the original artist ? hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song . very misleading and disappointing !
1	satisfied
0	the song is listed a keep on smiling but it not what you get when you download it . thats suck ! there is nothing i can do .
0	well , having listened to this c.d. , i am sorry to say this album is pure crap ! yes , i am a die hard beatles fan , but i can not figure why anybody would like this recording . the instrument sound cheap , the drummer is woeful and the sound in part sound thin . i admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer , but part of this are unlistenable . i heard my mate copy and would not even bother to buy it myself . very poor album .
1	chris tomlin never disappoints , his worshipful heart is evident in this album . his music touch every generation , my grandchild , my child and i , all find something to like in burning light .
0	the mp # version ha a nasty skip in voldomiro - the first track !
0	while , at 99 cent , the collection is quite cheap and feature some fine performance , buyer should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly : it is drastically ( and clumsily cut ) . we get the soprano recitative there were shepherd abiding in the field , but not the marvelous aria that follows . and his yoke is easy , his burden is light , along with he shall feed his flock is also missing . i would have gladly given up a few of the other 111 amazing track in order to get a messiah that wasnt edited in such a clumsy fashion . this seems like a performance worth getting to know , but those who purchase this collection will be missing quite a bit . ( a helpful commentator on this review pointed out the the entire bach collegium japan messiah is available in & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/111-amazing-classical-handel/dp/b00g7kbsb2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > 111 amazing classical : handel < /a >
1	it is a great cd ! i enjoy every song . you need to be aware , though , that there are 3 song that would not be considered christmas song . they are amazing musician . good quality sound .
1	great 80 song !
1	beautiful lyric easy listening
1	this cd ha made it possible for me to breathe easily for the first time it year . kudos to mr fredricksen for bringing buteykos method to light !
0	the cd wa just okay . i am from chicago and i love house music but this wa kinda lame . a lot of the song sound alike but the bass is booming ! i am a dancer and i can only use about 3 of the 12 track . i am glad it did not cost a lot .
1	excellent ! excellent ! excellent ! this is heaven . though l do not speak the lang the voice move me spiritually . i have been replaying the song since l bought it . doe he have other hymns/gospel in the same lang ? not english please . thank you for the heavenly song !
0	i listened to the preview and i find it kind of annoying that this is even listed with all of these musical piece .
1	it is not the original version , but he get close to it . i had heard this song back in 1993 and wa very moved by the lyric . i inquired at several record store and could never find out who song it . i finally wa able to google it ( 2010 ) and found the exact song by eddy grant . the song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color . great song and powerful message , a must listen for the cultural sensitive person .
1	great song
1	okay , i bought this for one one song . jesus savior , it s a great song and i love the message behind it . my family just sigh when i pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it . they know no matter the season that song will be played . haha
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band ( the only original holdover at this point ) , i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos . that said , like the predecessor set ( 1969s never going back to georgia ) , anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970s gulf coast bound on their turntable . working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld , these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album . added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne . a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp , leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial . regardless of their history , i have always been a big blue magoos fan , but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength . like that other band , this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence . with three percussionist in the mix , track like slow down sundown , can not get enough of you , and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin-flavored percussion and soul-jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sounds-the-same disease . the combination of latin percussion and pseudo-jazzy move ( flatulent horn and aimless vibe ) , may have sounded good on paper , but i dare anyone to try sitting through the 12 minute can not get enough of you . simply horrible . adding to their problem , neither ka ( shown a kaz on the writing credit ) , nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice . they may have sounded okay in a live setting , but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight . - propelled by alfred elli on sax , the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number . in the positive column , this wa the album shortest and most focused performance . in the negative column , the song wa a mess . sporting a forgettable melody , crappy vocal , and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion , elli endless sax solo just made thing worse . rating : * star - slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance . the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove , but the harsh , strained lead vocal , the jazzy touch ( discordance sax solo ( apparently meant to sound like jungle animal ) , vibe and heavy percussion ) ultimately killed it . okay , the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile . rating : * star - and then there wa the 12 plus minute epic can not get enough of you . the song actually started out sounding pretty good - nice , funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar . and then thing turned horribly wrong . hideous group vocal ( i think kaz had the lead on this one ) , a meandering melody , and endless and pointless solo . imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and you will know what this one sounded like . rating : * star - penned by newcomer elli , the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe ( think about mid-1990s elevator music and you will get a feel for this one ) . technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo , but it wa also sort of soulless . rating : * star - tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland , vocally painful , and instantly forgettable ballad . rating : * star - the lone group composition , the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz-rock fusion . their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff , but to my ear it is basically noise . rating : * star the album wa also tapped for a single ( their last 45 ) : - 1970s gulf coast bound b/w sea breeze express ( abc catalog 11238 ) sporting one of the year ugliest cover ( blame designer ron lieberman ) certainly did not help sale . all told , a sad footnote to their recording legacy . gulf coast bound track listing : ( side 1 ) 1 . ) gulf coast bound ( eric kaz - emil thielhelm ) - 3:51 2 . ) slow down sundown ( eric kaz - j. andreolli - emil thielhelm ) - 6:09 3 . ) can not get enough of you ( eric kaz ) - 12:21 ( side 2 ) 1 . ) magoos blue ( instrumental ) ( alfred elli ) - 7:54 2 . ) tonight the sky about to cry ( eric kaz - j. andreolli ) - 5:14 3 . ) sea breeze express ( instrumental ) ( eric kaz - j. andreolli - emil thielhelm - alfred elli - richie dickon - jim payne - john liello - j. lopresti - 4:13 for anyone interested , the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at : [ . ]
1	easy to learn and good song for a praise team , and a child choir get you blessing ! it great !
0	no good
0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place . if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i wa you will be very disappointed . at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing . other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad . i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album . i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor . girl , you have the talent so please get back to your root . gary w. hill
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient . all the solo are pointless finger exercise . there are about 800 or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature . try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar .
1	i recommend this product to anyone who enjoys barbra streisand and the movie , the way we were . i chose this because i love her voice and i like the song .
1	love this corney song i play for anyones birthday
1	i am very happy with this cd .
1	i fell in love with ann wilson the first time i heard dreamboat annie . 36 year later , ann wilson sound even better . wether you are a heart fan , or have never heard the group before , this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll .
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
0	everything about this album is just bad . from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting . it is terrible . ok , let u start it with the obvious . how do they forget the ya-yas version of midnight rambler again ! ? hell , even the album version would be acceptable . that song is undeniably a stone classic , in every single sense of the word . it wa bad enough to miss it on 40 lick , but it omission here is indefensible . that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it . you could make a full cd of song that do not deserve to be here . more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting . then some classic that do not really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem . are not fade away , have you seen your mother , fool to cry , respectable , and the last time really better song than can not you hear me knocking , moonlight mile , let it bleed , and all down the line ? and come on . street of love , harlem shuffle , highwire , love is strong , anybody seen my baby , do not stop ? over album cut like sway , bitch , and monkey man ? i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career , but they should really focus on the golden year , rather than equal time allowed for these awful 90 cut . hell , i mean even we love you , little red rooster , and heart of stone are bad choice . look , i know i have a bias . i love these boy . disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into , they are inarguably the single greatest rock ` n roll band of all time . but even a a major major fan , i would not recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone . i cut my teeth on this band with 40 lick . it wa a good intro to the band . or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band . it is basically the same story here , although they were smart enough to add she wa hot ( even though the shine a light version is much better ) and the killer , kick-ass , powerhouse rock off . other than that , there is no difference between them . 5 star for the music , obviously . i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to ` em . insanely , absurdly , unbelievably great stuff . but do not get this album . it is not worth the price . find a friend who love the stone ( if you are smart , you will have a few ) and ask them to make you a mix . or get 40 lick , used , for a couple buck . just stay away from this nonsense . no midnight rambler ! ? the title grrr ! ! ? . a gorilla ! ? i give up . i am going to my room and putting on sticky finger .
1	have one thing to say , i love this song and listen to it every day . this song is a must have . very relaxing .
1	what can i say ? the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid , original and unique . i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl . then , i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me & you , cherri denniss hit i love you . finally , he put out his first self-titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum . there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved . but , the world just wasnt ready ! now , my fav underated artist/producer is back with his second album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first one . on this album ryan is more laid back and taking thing slow . i am in love with the infectious sunday night . i am also glad he put awesome resuce you ( which is only on the bonus cd ) . your not my girl is a funky moderate track that take you back to the olskool.zodiac is another groovy track . overall , this album it totally different than the first one . but , a a loyal fan i am gon na say get the album anyway and support this talented man ! next selection !
1	great worship song
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off . i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude . but come on people . by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space . to leave track such a take it away/ballroom dancing/tug of war/c moon/vanilla sky/helen wheels/bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable .
0	typical , i love pitbull , but you have fallen into a same old same old rutget some new blood in the machine baby !
1	i love this song . it fit the movie .
1	cabaret still shine well after decade . in her day , nobody could deliver like liza and cabaret illustrates why . you have to hear it again to understand .
0	thumb down
0	could not get it to play . tried on every player i could find .
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once . ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate , and his voice is nothing special . his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous . i would have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune . a waste of money .
0	it is terrible when fm radio play out a song that wa average to begin with . it make it even more lackluster to the discerning listener
0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album . i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work i would been seeing on her video . it just wasnt there for me . i will still play it but it will not be one of my favorite . my advice would be get a new producer .
1	great song is time of need when you need to lifted up . my soul do say yes to the creator of this universe . lord , i thank you and continue to bless brian wilson . this man can sing anything that is family oriented and church .
1	although gretchen is a self-proclaimed redneck woman , this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production . the christmas song for example , is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase . i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song . it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original . santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight . have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming . it is one of my personal favorite . the others are good too . in fact , the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about 98 % annoying and 2 % cute . overall : although i love country music from time to time , sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move . fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere , with just the right touch of signature gretchen . her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well . i give it a solid recommendation !
1	this is ideal music for easy listening . it play well a background , or for intent listening . eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well . her song are well-chosen & have depth & meaning . fortunately , she doe not try to showcase her entire range in each song , like some other talented singer such a celine dion , whitney houston & mariah carey . this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening . she outshines almost all other female vocalist . her cd are hard to find , so if you see one , buy it . you will not regret it ! i would love to see more from this artist , including original work !
1	saw him on agt , and loved his version of this song . had to buy it ! will hopefully get some other song .
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent , but the cd no longer will play , only played it twice , now no longer work ! i guess you get what you pay for applies here !
1	all of phyllis hymans song made me cry . even this one . beautifully sung . www.k-mille.net
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day . i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music . first off , her voice is absolutely amazing . some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million . most people that came up around christinas time do not even compare in vocal range . she had such a big voice for a pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album . but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own term and in her own word . stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time . she sang from the heart and great experience . she took u on a journey of finding her own voice ( in the figurative and literal sense ) , writing her own song , and working with the people she wanted to work with . teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing she is ever done career wise . i do not know what happened between them , but she ha not been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped . though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work ; it did not quite catch the essence of strippeds christina . bionic wa a huge fail , even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song . lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped . there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it 2 star but they are nowhere near memorable . it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual . but either she need to retire from music or get it together .
1	this is my favorite mark knopfler song . i can not say it is typical , but it is soooo beautiful ! randy travis also recorded it , but i prefer mks version .
1	took his course up at the conference center . amazing ! changed my life . increased my biblical understanding by 1000 % ! you simply can not go wrong with this . and dan ha been teaching this method to student of all type , culture , country , and language for generation . it work , and you will understand it . all material , not a lot of added unnecessary b.s . ( sorry ) . in other word the focus is the lesson , not dan ! if i could buy it for you , i would . if i could put it online for free , i would . but i can not . but it is le than $ 10 , so just get it .
0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe . but this just wasnt up to her usual . it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger , le universal audience . it also felt like she had forced the new song - they did not flow . and the male vocal did not mix with her voice . disappointing .
0	3 of the song on the cd are scratched : - (
1	a great album . i am now a great new fan .
1	this is a awesome cd . full of cruchy guitar , dual solo , thumping bass and pounding drum . everything tou would expect from stryper and more !
1	iv been collecting mucic for over 53 year and let me tell you that this 2 cd super rock . this is one cd i am proud to have in my collection !
0	this wa a free download for amazon cloud . the voice were not very good . i could see the supposedly funny side but wa not impressed ! i got le than what free should be !
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior . however , the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing ( about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face ) . i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track . honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters .
1	once again , micheal castaldo ha brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of prayr . micheals rich , soulful voice always touch the heart and soul of the listener , and prayr is no exception . this song , done in both italian and english , prof once again , that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language . micheals interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and i truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves . if you have not yet purchased prayr . do not wait any longer . it is destined to be a mega-hit !
1	i mean seriously , if you do not know and love this song , you either should not be listening to the door or something is wrong with you . i know it college music these day , but all the same .
0	the book think & grow rich is a must own . it is book to be read multiple time . that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone . he doe not pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph . you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second . the narrator ha a strong voice it is just emotionless . it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud . but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming . bottomline : buy the book , buy the audio book just skip this one .
1	the history of this song is very intense if you listen to the lyric . also the singing voice are very well in tune .
0	i bought album for some old favorite i remember . the playlist list the correct song title but the song that play is different . most song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite ( when irish eye are smiling , who put the overalls. , macnamaras band , etc ) were not really what played . very strange but a waste of money .
1	this song is truly inspiring . i first heard it during a worship session at a church i wa visiting . i quickly found it on amazon .
0	this album just did not do it for me . i got it when it came out , because i have all their cd and love them to death . it is too girly and poppy for me , high-pitched . the lyric are not all that clear , and do not mesh well together to mean one thing . most of all , the melody of the song are hard to listen to . you know how some song are just . difficult for the ear to enjoy ? these song are fine most of the time . but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody ( or the singing ) is difficult to listen to . there are a few really enjoyable , feeling-filled song though . control , secret , and sleepwalking get 5 star from me . the rest get about 3 star . i can not relate to them much , and i do not get much pleasure from listening to them . but i will always love tbms older stuff , and their newer hide and seek album .
1	anything that patti labelle sings can not be bad ! i loved this song when she and michael mcdonald first recorded it , on separate coast , and i still love it ! wonderful album ! maryg
1	after watching the movie secretariat this had to be a part of my playlist .
0	definitely not his best work . song either to rap or slow . nothing like his last 2 album . it ha to grow on me or a big waste of money .
1	this group , especially this album , ha ruined me . i literally can not listen to any other music for more than a couple song before playing babel from start to finish . these guy are in a league of their own . i am fairly certain i will never enjoy a group music more than i enjoy mumford & son .
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 a a member of brogian bard and independent solo artist and have never heard something that i did not like and usually loved marc gunn is talented in many different hat such a podcaster for celtic music in many different format listen to him again and again a he always make you feel ultimately good even his death song album . his take and twist on scifi and parody are among the best
1	diana krall is a real cool chick on this number .
0	ok
1	love anything that elvis sings
0	not the best song she ha done ! you got ta love the ministry to really enjoy this song . maybe there is more to come !
1	beautiful music to enjoy
1	album of the year !
1	i love this song ! i can not get it out of my head ! guaranteed you will hear this all summer long !
0	this review is only for this version of the album ( the remastered expanded edition ) . the mastering sound overly compressed , and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough . the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track . it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album . people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album . save your money and buy the original 1993 edition instead . the bonus 3 song are great , but the remastering wa entirely pointless .
1	i enjoyed the music ; however , would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download . would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd .
0	honestly . i hate this song . i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it . it is another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem . i respect them and really like some of their stuff . ace wa a bos ! . but this is just campy .
0	i received the album and it looked great except for the dint in the sleeve and when i opened it it had a dint in the record !
1	awesome brings back many memory of good time , i am a sucker for the oldie
0	seriously another generic radio rock band that fall in the theory of a deaman my darkest day popevil buckcherry just straight up generic rock that sound like bon jovi meet nickelback that will be in roatation at rock station for the next 3 month then no one will remember who this band is seriously can we be a little more originally please !
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers , back when she first released this album . i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story , evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop . sure , the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented- but , if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book , it is the detail that really count ! when it came to the music , i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book . for example , laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter . instead of using the lyric provided , however , desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song , claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush . by the same token , her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa , when he came home from running around town , and she had not known where he wa . no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series ! if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song , this album will fit the bill nicely . if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew , a she knew it , keep looking .
1	awesome
0	do not like it
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast , at least for me , with seemingly everything entertaining ( news program , comedy monologue , tv show ) around u hop , skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) . it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye . but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up ? i do not think so ! jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look-out for and enjoy on a daily basis . storytelling is not something new , in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate . and while storytelling can be from one person to another , it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story , and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story . in southern style , you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story , and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home . to me , southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer , and it is still considered an art . having lived all over the united state , i know other region have great storyteller , but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy . some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education , or a tv or radio , and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained . whatever the case , it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson . while all of ms. robertson cd are excellent , southern style , to me , is the cream of the crop , and through amazon you can now download it . i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good , and they have a tendency to interweave : from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband ( left-brain ) exploit , to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina ( fancy wrap ) in new york . in closing , let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south , with it great storyteller , but for those of you who were not , i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson .
0	i really thought this album wa going to be a game changer . boy wa i wrong . i feel like this is a boring album . i only enjoyed a few song such a medicated and the plan . rolling paper had a couple song i love and still listen to on a regular basis ( when i am gone & camera ) . this album could have been so much more . all the hype and the push back for such an average album
1	who rock harder than nickelback ? i downloaded this song because i listen to it weekly when wwe come on . so now i use it a a ringtone for my android phone .
0	volume is low when put in a mall radio .
1	such a great tune and could listen to it all day . blake clean version is just a good . make all redneck proud .
1	it is pretty good . had it playing outside the front door halloween night . good mood maker .
0	not the one i wa looking for
1	the cd got to pr in no time , it wa in great condition and it wa overall perfect since i love manson and his new album
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music ! except that it is cut at the end . tragic end for such a fine piece of music . this music is on a par with heilig , by schubert , sung by the choir of trinity college , cambridge . these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb . however , this one is ruined by being cut short at the end , before the music is finished .
0	this is a very average song and cook scream in some place instead of singing . hard to believe that chris cornell wrote it .
0	i like other song by her better , this song is okay , but she ha done a lot better on her other song .
0	oops , bought by mistake . do not waste your money
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever , however , this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty . the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90 would have have submitted to company a a demo . i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies , but with this album i fail to see that expansion , and if anything , the feel appears to be reflecting the mood , not neccessairly the word , of the so-called economic recovery of the united state . overall , if this were his first album , it would receive a higher rating , but it is not . i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session ; i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry , hollow , and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with . if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording , i suggest finding someone else .
0	some is a bit catchy , but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle . sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her . lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out . high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to .
0	i need to quantify my review up front . in my dictionary , you look up the word music , class brass , professional , and you will see chicago . anyone who know me , know that chicago is , and ha been , my favourite group since dirt , hand down . the only other band closer is the beatles . i own every 331/3 album , and every cd , twice . my key chain say chicago . my refrigerator and front door ha chicago magnet inside and out . anything with the chicago logo on it get saved . need more proof of my loyalty ? this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache . i did not say anything when this group started re-issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue , i figured they earned the right , plus they had to eat . despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath , the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist-singer peter cetera , this group really worked hard , both in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vibrant part of the music scene . it is not easy to stay current for 40 year and please everyone . when the new guy came on the scene , you did not hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera . cetera wa gone , jeff wa in and that is that . i did not ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath , and frankly , i did not want them to . even the drummer , tris imboden , wa musically right for the fit of this band , all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold . but folk , this is not right . chicago ha more talent than this . part of me want very hard to salute them for being there for 40 year , the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert . i can hear the same stuff on night and day , chicago 21 and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago . i do not know , maybe i am just getting to old , but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well . if you have to have it , then buy it . if you are hard up for money , save it for food or something worthwhile . i know my mom said that if i did not have anything nice to say then i should not say anything , but i am not getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one . usually i am stoked and can not wait to tell a friend . i may have to pull the shade and bolt the door and turn off the telephone . thank goodness i have 29 other chicago album to listen to . better luck next time fella . maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen ?
0	they chopped the song off ! the original song is 4:30. the edited song , which appears here , wa chopped off at around 3:33. huge disappointment . and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing .
1	for me , all but one song made for a very good cd . their voice are growing in depth and enrichment . it is different music from their first cd some , like my father , who loved their first cd ( because it wa all of the italian favorite = and he is italian ) did not like this second album at all . my husband and i liked it very much !
1	my boy favorite song . they sing this to the top of their lung . the youngest say we are fighting the devil when we sing this song nan ! anointed !
1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore-based quartet . this is a real band using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old-school type soul voice i have heard this year . these are all original song too . the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy , and it is consistently good listening from start to finish . i do have favourite though , including the fantastic opener , never leave you lonely , hope too high , breathe love , maybe i am not the man , evil woman ( which i am sure us the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country , though this is not acknowledged ) , they do not know , time stop ( heartfelt balladry at it best ) and the funky closer , it aint over . this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop , i will never know . i would never have heard of them if not for a uk-based black music monthly magazine . if you like soul like it wa made back in the day , you will probably love this . get a copy while you can .
0	i enjoyed it more when i wa a 16 year old hippie . audio quality wa good . i forgot the rant about god though and that wa enough for me to delete it .
1	r kelly by far ha left the r & b wanta be in the dark . r kelly ha produced hit for some of the biggest name in the musinc industry . to come out with a album that totally switch up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing . this album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really want to hear ( music ) . again , go get it !
0	only liked one song . let your hair down david make something fun and not boring . we hear the same old traditionals every year .
1	this is the rest song in the world
0	i like to download the free song and album to find artist that are different within their genre . sister hazel is not one .
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think . if you are stuck in the early 70s-or bust mentality of cooper-fandom , then this album is not for you . but zcs is strong from beggining to end , with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious . adaptable , i like girl , remarkably insincere , all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them , mainly because of the lyric . this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices 80 album , the others being flush the fashion and special force . all three , while they do not match most of his 70 album , deliver the hard rock good , while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand-up comic . it work . the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of 1984 , i am the future , which should have tipped u off to what wa to come- namely the dreadful dada album .
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect , it is better than that . it is world guitar music . it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when you are awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep . i skip those song , the others are great . i loved the price on this , and it wa definitely worth it !
0	this one is not good at all . used to be a fan of his but he is fallen . he is fallen far . it is a sad effort to be honest .
0	i received a discount on this product for my honest feedback . good item
1	another one of that amazon had a a sampler when i got it . i have enjoyed listening to this countless time . i also recommend the 2013 version .
0	wile i am sure it is just right for some folk , and i like a lot of cajun & zydeco music , this one just did not do it for me . i actually did not keep it . deleted .
0	there were only a few song i liked . not what i expected .
0	i bought this song , hoping that this version also included the verse a well a the refrain . sadly , it is only the refrain . my mom used to sing this song around the house , and i had searched for a long time for a recording ( with word ) . the listen ability on amazon only give a bit of the refrain , but i purchased it anyway with great hope . ok , it wa only 99 cent , so no harm done . but , it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse . i found the word in a museum in valdes , alaska a few year back ; found the verse again online at a lyric website , so i know a verse exists .
1	amazing voice
0	first of all , you can barely make out most of what they are saying . the production value are terrible . i could have done a better job with a 1980s 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining . in fact , i am pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version . secondly , the message is stupid . they do not really have anything worthwhile to say , and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind . everything about this band , about this album , wa a waste of time . this is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover . there is no way the music wa going to sell this album !
0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl album we have . not so . this is a 3 cd set and load of track but many of them are kind of jazz style , strange slow singing and empty feeling . there were a few pleasant traditional piece , but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there . if you want to experiment it might be worth the money , but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this .
1	i heard this on kjzz , my favorite for jazz music , and liked it well enough to get the mp3 version .
1	i absolutely love this song . back in the day when i wa a little girl , i would hear my grandparent playing the song because it would come on the radio which now make me feel old but i am only 38. i love older song and this is one of many that emmylou harris wrote that is still popular to this day .
0	i wanted to buy this song but when i tried to preview it , the song is just not the one . please check it .
0	not one memorable song.disappointing
1	the good morning song is what i bought this for , but love the cd a well . the good morning song can take a drabby day and put pep in your step , brighten your face a you sing along & dance with her . thank you mandisa for blessing u with your god given talent !
1	this cd is hilarious , i admit there are some song that are not really funny , but there always 1 or 2 bad song on an album ( in this one , the 1 bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song ) . also if you are easily offended by swearing , raciest remark ( do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny ) so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this . but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
1	exceptional album , amazing video .
0	this cd ha a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining ! very depressing ! her voice crack , scrape and she can not quite hit the note . buy bonnie raitt instead .
1	old school excellence
1	i miss those goodnight kiss
1	excellent product and service .
1	great blueys song
1	cute
0	it wa not the full dvd that i expected . very disappointed .
1	great song !
0	lost is right , this disc being the covermount ( not for resale ) disc from classic rock magazine issue 103 , march 2007. it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time , overlooked gem and curio that might be of interest to hard rock fan . ummm . well part of that plan ha been achieved . they are certainly curio . curio from the realm of apathy generation . because that is what you will probably feel when listening to these track . sure , tucky buzzard has/had some reason to exist and a few of these track might pique the interest of the occasional aficionado but much of it is so eclectic it is hard to see anybody listening to these number and thinking to themselves ` hey , i got ta get me some more tune by the aynsley dunbar retaliation . and i do not will not to dis this sampler even though that is what i am doing . it is just that people into these band probably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl . and nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted , if you get my drift . anyway , i played this once and that wa a chore .
0	i do not know what version this is but it suck . i like another version of this song i had before but ii am not gon na keep buying them to find it .
0	no thunder . at all !
1	great worship this song is everything
1	my second favorite r & b album of the year , right behind anti from riri . this wa a grower at first but it is bumpin loud around the house now . it wa hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all i kept playing wa welcome to my world ! { we in this bitch } hold on ! { another great hip hop an r & b tracc for u best of me fan } an elevator . the rest of the album is great like team you ! coolin ! & smoove jones afta glow show ! { outro } but one man woman is weak .
1	great song , heard him sing it on american idol and had to have it , i like the acoustic version just a well a the other .
1	i love this song and on top of it all it wa super easy to download and to listen on any device .
1	i listen to this cd every day . all day . i absolutely love this group . i get inspired and motivated . feel good music by a family-group that can really sing !
0	million of american listen to music on their ipod . try telling that to this record label , which willfully made this cd incompatible with itunes . i do not mind buying music digitally , but i also like to keep a physical copy of the cd for my collection . copy protection doe not give you this option . i am absolutely enraged and i feel like screaming . avoid !
1	what a great song . the fact that my daughter love it a much a i do is a bonus . the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done and modern curious george is pure greatness !
1	exellent
0	not worth the purchase .
1	i recently went on a tour of hearst castle in central california . there is a grand dining room where invited hollywood celebrity and others dined in the 1930s - 1950s . our tour guide told u that he liked tumbling tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song , tumbling tumbleweed , over and over ! -
1	thank you
1	it would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of jennis father geoff and an admired of her mother , maria . so . those question are answered . a for the cd and jenni on her own , this is a well thought out , highly listenable and original album . it ha been playing on my equipment for several year now , and wear well . enjoy .
1	i like music and i find certain song that are inspiring and energizing . i have picked certain song from different album that i use to worship the lord and uplift me through the day
1	i had most of these number on two cassette tape , which eventually wore out , so i wa delighted to find they would been combined into one cd . the quality wa excellent and it wa like having an old friend who would moved away come back to the neighborhood !
0	i am so disgusted with amazon this season . 1/3 of the christmas are offensive , explicit , and revolting , and it is not even a week into december . i saw that it wa lady gaga , so i wa wary at first , but i decided to give the preview a chance . light me up and put me on top ? really amazon , really ? christmas spirit includes carol , wintery atmosphere , giving , etc . not sexual innuendo . so disappointing , esp . after the first great song by casting crown .
1	addictive
0	purchased but did not download to my playlist
1	found this mp3 download while browsing and remembered just how fabulous the door were . love this song and am really happy with the download !
0	this recent purchase wa resold for a couple dollar ! it is virtually all noise . the vocal by mick jagger are ragged and imo there is not a single good song among . the lot .
1	love it . play it over and over
1	it is prince ! plain and simply a legend ! # rip
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent . so when they put out christmas album , they knew what would work , and what would not , and made their musical selection accordingly . you will notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement . but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously . some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious , and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice . but big name produce big fear , and so , we have this piece of musical garbage . a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa . and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name . everything else is like nail on a chalkboard . doe not dylan have enough money a it is ? but there could be a bright side . the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high-level interrogation . but it could be against the geneva convention .
1	the title explains the song . it inspires a person to keep going and that they have value . keep it on !
1	this album ha me rocking out to favorite track like carry me back and levi while also cooling down with bob dylan-esque track including aint it enough and the way of man . overall all the banjo and fiddle romp leave me yearning for a blue grass festival .
1	like most people , i only buy song i have already heard and liked , so . yeah , i think it is good .
0	something is up with the sound quality of this . i purchased it through amazon and received a digital download . the sound quality is weak , i do not know if i should try this again ? are the cd similar in sound quality ? it is a if too many db are being pushed through the system and you can tell a weakness in sound even at a low volume . it is weird !
0	this is terribly , embarrassingly boring . i know that phil spector is not dead yet , but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he is been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis . if you thought garbage wa garage , you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for an entire landfill . in either case , take my advice and head in the opposite direction . in & out of control is nothing more than disney music for the cutting set . the stuffed toy market most definitely also extends to the suicidal-fantasy demographic . cotton candy noose and jelly has-been . oh , i buried you today indeed .
1	love this and keep it on my kindle and play over and over again . have this on a cd also in my car . quite beautiful !
1	these two are amazing .
0	i really liked michael grimm voice on america got talent . the cd , however , is a disappointment because that voice is lost in the production . le instrumentation & accompaniment and more michael would have made this an enjoyable listen .
1	just about everything this man writes is better than the last .
0	i guess i do not have the right device to play them . unable to view .
0	music did not download .
1	i have listened to this album probably 5 time since this morning . i have been a long time volbeat fan . these guy bring it all to the table with this album . trust me . get it ! now !
1	some good music from the past that get only light current radio play ( i have not heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly ) . and most of these will not get much play 30 year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality song not heard much today .
1	powerful . very upbeat song
1	one of the most overlooked album in it is respective genre in the last 10 year
0	quality is ify .
0	. but this is a poorly produced cd . both the computer-enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solo , and the overuse of vibrato in the solo make this a definite disappointment .
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out . i bought it . and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song ( for a total of 18 ) on this version . i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed . i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out . the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy . the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly . this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album . sadly , this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original . instead of a strong , punctuating beat to accompany some good lyric from the original , the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original . the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler . india message just do not resonate with me on this album . she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album , while this album is very idealistic and overly positive . hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin , back to the middle , video , and nature in the future .
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation , this album is just a good or better . what ? ! if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica . if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it would not be bluegrass . when u2 decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked . that is what this is . they did not just slightly switch the sound of the instrument . they dropped the authentic , folk , real-sounding instrument ( keep in mind . i hate hipster ) , and went with what can only be described a a fake sounding electronic drum set , a synthesizer keyboard ? , and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything . it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented . doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome ? yes . doe this album have a few ok melody ? yes . if this wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene ? absolutely not . you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all you want , but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound . they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool , like u2 did from joshua tree to achtung baby . but like i said before , this is like going from joshua tree to pop . they should have learned from u2 .
1	it is prince . duh !
0	i understand this song is supposed to be all political and deep and whatnot , but her voice and the sound of this song altogether make me want to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that i never have to listen to one second of this song ever again for a long a i live . i am very diverse in my music taste but i hate this song , i really think this is the worst song ever to be released in the history of time .
0	awful . only disk 2 available .
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes , and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own . railroad earth ( 6 piece new-grass jamband ) provides great support giving all these song ( 8 out of 13 which are haynes original ) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel ( like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail ) . i enjoyed the whole of disc1 even though haynes song writing itself is only so-so , and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc 2 are not bad , although none of them seem essential . in fact , i thought the final live track weak , and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation . so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fan . overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing ( especially slide ) from haynes , an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette .
1	i can relate to this song all the way around because my father passed away in 2011 and he including my mother and i knew it wa his time to let go . i listen to this song in memory of him .
1	love this cd ! the message is great and the music make you want to dance ! this particular song ( beautiful ) is a song every person , especially young woman , should hear and heed .
0	major disappointment . always been a huge bh fan from way back . the songwriting is trite and uninspired . take no chance musically . dont get me started on the ridiculous political statement he is trying to make with the title track . utterly forgettable album .
0	this wa the clean version , i want all my music they way the artist intended , with f-bombs !
1	play it all time . love it
0	i enjoy music that clearly tell a story ; the tone is moving and very enjoyable . what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the word that are sung . hopefully artist in the future could follow example ; where music could be music again .
0	i do not understand , how serious yes fan can consider this fly from here to be a real yes album . step back to the real world , dude : this is nothing else than an album that could be better titled a drama , vol 2. . but this time , the performing band name is maybe . . hey , but . what can you really expect when there is no more jon anderson and rick ( or even his so-talented son adam ) wakeman , back in the full gang ? in addition , trevor horn ha buggles-ed the music once again . this fly from here , definitely , only ha the cover art ( another excellent work of the maestro roger dean ) of a yes album . the music , really performed by the band maybe . and zero star .
1	i really love this song and enjoy having it on my computer and kindle . i like the idea of choosing the song i want and not having to purchase the entire album .
0	the bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986 , the music wa just a awful a i remembered it . serious hair metal , here . i listened to the whole album through prime music ( thanks , amazon ) and decided that even though this is getting glowing review , stryper just is not for everyone .
0	occasional ( just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off ) popping noise and brief second where there is no sound occasionally . only found this with his recording and i have not tried them all . wish i could return this purchase a i will not be listening again . : /
0	disappointing ; very much mor type music . not what i had hoped for , sadly .
0	i can not figure out why this song wa so popular in the first place ? only thing i can tell you is stay away from this one . worst song in the 90 period .
0	the sound quality is poor . youtube ha a version by beecham and the royal philharmonic with much better quality .
0	did not order this
1	i have been a fan for many year . this is a great collection . there is only one track i do not care for and i will skip over .
0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had heard . it turn out that is the only good song on it . the rest of the cd is not anything i want to listen to . what else can i say ? steer clear .
0	sounded like pure dog poo . his career is finished for suing h3h3 , go to hell
1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out . it wa really good , but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then . i got this , because i had a $ 1 amazon mp3 credit awarded for a purchased cd . after skimming through a few other artist , i remembered this song and picked it up . the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than the original , which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track .
1	i have given a few copy of the cd and guide to family and friend because it brings one closer to the blessed mother and in touch with the lord . i listen to it driving , working out or when i feel i need to quiet myself . susan ha really done a great job with this and it is worth the purchase .
1	good price
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr . if you count the tommy james solo hit draggin the line then they are tied . bottom line is ccr wa a classic album group and t.j. & s were strictly a single group .
1	this song is very special to me a i am a proud navy wife . any song that honor the military is great . this song wa played at the funeral of a very special navy seal . it always brings tear to my eye .
1	easy and fast download
1	this is a very good album . saw him perform some of these song at sacramento , ca in 1971 .
0	only a soulless piece of trash would support a band that justifies and support rape of a helpless innocent woman . and for good measure , their music suck !
1	tyte trakk
1	i love it . thanks . the cd arrived on time and wa a described
1	barb still ha it
1	i am not a parent ( but i play one on tv ? ; ) , but i used to be a nanny . my 2-3yr old twin obsessed over hi-5 , and i have to say , some of their tune were pretty darn catchy . i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more ( you know , the one that got stuck in * my * head all day long , that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself ? hah ) to make a collection cd out of them , this being one of those song ; i admit , i really did not mind ( too much ) having to listen to them every.single.time we got in the car and went somewhere . if i am going to be forced to listen to something over and over on a daily basis , there are far worse thing it could be . if you have got young kid , give this song a whirl .
0	zorro is ok - the rest is quirky but poor .
0	strong political view that are ranted about through the medium . refuse to listen to it a second time .
1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured in film . i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my day .
1	i wish more folk knew about ernests music . this is not your typical folk artist . ernest wa makin folk/blues/rock music in the 70 before he launched his composition career in la . film score , television score , & emmy later , he got back to his root & gave u the opportunity to enjoy where he came from ( his hobby a he describes it ) . listen to this album ! it wa released nearly a year & 1/2 before katrina . besides the prescient title cut , evangaline , disturbin blue , & travelin shoe should solidify your love of this talented composer , singer , song-writer , and guitarist par excellance !
0	i am trying to award this zero star but am forced to give it one . careful - most of the review here are for the 1994 broadway revival - which give high mark . this mp3 recording is for the 2008/9 london revival . the london recording is dreadful - truly awful . carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung . give this one a miss . try any of the others you find here instead . in fact this is so badly misrepresented by amazon by using the wrong review i am going to ask for my money back . - amazon duly issued a refund within a day of my request and agreed the wrong review are linked to this album . they are working on correcting the link ! if you arrived here from the link on the broadway cast revival cd page - this is not the mp3 album you are looking for . at least on july 3rd 2010 .
0	not worth the money
0	first off . i am a big fan of hln which is why i bought this cd . this cd ha once again proved that music is a business and this wa just that . business . huey wa quoted recently that he ha employee and want to keep them employed , with benefit . interview with ew : so there is got to be a market out there . but how you get to them , i have no idea . and you know what ? i am not interested . - huey lewis on cd sale . aside from jumping on the yesterday bandwagon with the like of rod stewart , sheryl crow and others , the news a usual delivers a great polished performance worthy of one of the best backing band in the history of music . hueys voice however lack enthusiasm and sound forced to say the least . most of the positive 4 and 5 star review on here are from hlns website . huey singing about a turd in a toilet would be 5 star to them ! i strongly encourage you to skip this one and purchase another cd from hln from their heyday ( 1980 - 1999 ) . on that note , if huey want to secure his employee , why not release a dvd box set or original material ?
0	her voice is not the problem but the arrangement is boring with harsh repetive line . i would like to hear her sing this song with the help of a different backup band , arranger and composer .
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
1	an absolute classic in my eye !
1	screechy , and eerie , this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar .
0	sound quality very low ! but a great classic song !
1	one of the best compilation ; a great way to meet and learn about yes . when most people think of rock music , the general conception is that of boisterous , noisy , unruly dope . then group like yes , pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication . these tune are not only enjoyable , they also nurture one synphonic appreciation . thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock , which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece .
1	best song ever
1	this music and the lyric really are enough to encourage you along the way . but the vocal are simply amazing and make it seem so easy . not everyone can do this .
1	we lost this wonderful country singer way too young . his song calm the soul and lift your spirit . he will be missed .
0	used a directed and noticed no change in behavor , my food shopping did not change , eating did not change . but will keep using to see if there will be any change .
1	another memorial song of whitney
1	great great song .
0	yikes ! i mean . yikes ! what the ? are they kidding ? is this some kind of weird joke ? i could not wait to place my order for this long awaited live vh album , and i could not have been more excited the day it arrived . i carefully unwrapped it and studied the cool packaging ( no band pic though - very odd ) and let it rip . oh my god . what were they thinking ? this is so freaking bad i think it just turned me off music - period . the drum are sloppy , the guitar are surprisingly sloppy too , the key are lagging behind the band , the bass is solid though , but please , please , please do not even ask about the vocal . this is not the band i know and love . regretfully , i absolutely hate this release .
1	first of all we have to clear one thing up . 0304 mean 2003-2004 this is her music for those year . although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you . another thing many people have said that jewel ha sold out . i understand their point of view . if you are a die-hard jewel fan and do not like dance , pop , or very upbeat music then this cd is not for you . i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a well . so i wa very very pleased with this cd . this cd wa all about fun , experimentation , dancing , and just having a good time . so if you love any kind of dance music or pop or most of all a good time this cd is definitey for you . my overview of the track . 1. stand : one of my favorite . i love the lyric , the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome . put together really well 5/5 2. run 2 u : i love this song . it is a sort of sweet love song . the lyric remind me a bit of older jewel . but the music and the overall song is so new and fresh . 5/5 3. intuition : everyone in the world ha got to know this song . love it . the french accordian and the urban sound together fit really well . love the lyric a well 4.5/5 4. leave the light on : woohoo . jazzy . i love jewel and jazz together it go well . remember the song i will not walk away . from her album this way . this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat . 4/5 5 . 2 find u : wow . great , great lyric . i am sure they will touch anyone who ha been in a rocky relationship and is trying to save it . really heart-felt verse and angst driven chorus . 4.5/5 6. fragile heart : at first i wasnt feeling this song and wa like err ick . but after a couple listens i wa really impressed . really cute and simple song . reminiscent of i am sensitive from piece of you 4.5/5 7. doin fine : another one of my favorite . love it ! it is just about being free , having fun , and takng chance . i love the beat how jewel sound . everything . great summer anthem . 5/5 8 . 2 become 1 : i am not to fond of this . my least favorite track on the album . i just think it is like every other love song . nothing really special . and not very catchy in my eye at least . 2/5 9. haunted : the absolute best song ever ! i love this song . it is so cool jewel sings from stalker point of view . it is creepy , raw , and emotional . she sound so awesome . almost rock and roll . totally different from rest of album . i love it ! 10/5 10. sweet temptation : good song . if light and dark can be represented altogether in one song this is it . awesome beat . good stuff ! 4.5/5 11. yes u can : great dance song . i love how she sings it not cheap to buy your dream . i am not suprised santana who she wrote this for rejected it . he is not cool enough to pull it off . go jewel ! 5/5 12. u + me= love : another awesome song . reminds me a bit of run 2 u. however the lyric are so much better . like a girl anthem . just listen . great beat a well . 5/5 13. america : great message . i love controversial jewel . even if this wa a she sad a bit of a watered down version . i would pay big buck to see what the record label cut . get a little repetitive but the awesome lyric save it . 4/5 14. becoming : good song . not my favorite though . it ha good lyric however . not very catchy though . 3/5 . well . and wow ! another great piece from jewel . she sound great , she herself love this album . same old jewel writing the mst awesome lyric . just different sound . she is doing her thing and you are going to love it . it is light and dark but catchy and upbeat . however like i said before if you are a fan of jewel at all and do not like pop/dance music . then skip it . although i do miss the old jewel a bit . that is what the older album are for . i appreciate her keen sense of evolution . i can not even wait to see what she put out there next . buy this ! buy this ! buy this ! you will not regret it !
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection . even if you like sinatra you will be disappointed in dylan interpretation . if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity . if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it . very dismal , not even good for elevator music .
1	love his music
1	great song . the live version i think is better an the album version . i do not think this song got played alot .
0	every time i try to play . it crash my computer . dont buy . i bought to add to a powerpoint presentation and it will not work .
1	a ok
1	almost a good a liza . my 2nd favorite dance version of this song . or at least upbeat tempo . highly recommend ,
0	most of these are only portion of the song , such a 1 verse and the chorus . i would prefer the entire song . also , many are done with a country feel to them , not the traditional music you would hear in church . i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with , and it is not a hit . wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i-tunes wa 3 time the price .
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song . the rest is , well , all filler . and the record is only half an hour long , so there are only about another five complete song ( track one is a reminder of maiden ` s number of the beast and track three is 50 second long ) . it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well . piece of advice , tape or download the single and spend your money on something else .
1	nice song - i am not a big fan of old school country but this one not bad . a couple time in the song the lead vocal is a bit wobbly but she recovers well .
0	i cd di questi gruppi r & b sono tutti uguali - the same old story
1	i use to play this over & over again when i wa in college . i so loved this song .
1	i love her music . it contemporary gospel and this song just touched my heart the first time i heard it on the radio . worth the purchase .
1	this song still hold up nearly 30 year late . dramatic , big hook , great sounding production .
0	great version of this tune . this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason . however , it is fuzzy sounding , and doe not quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 second . i will try to get a refund . it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credit of the movie . the visuals add more than you can know .
1	this song of epic proportion broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew . it instilled in my heart such wonder that i can not even write in word how wonderfully wonderful it truly is . gangnam style not only fill your entire soul ( yes the entire soul ) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying , everythings alright . that tone form in the back of my mind every time i hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul . it keep whispering in my ear , go on , go over , you can do it . just a little longer . this song eclipse all other work of music , nay work of art in the world today ! beethoven would be proud , but he is dead . keep on gangnam , keep on !
0	i love fleetwood and stevie , but just could not get into this album .
0	no plot synopsis or any information about the production included .
1	my husband loved it !
1	a very soulful john anderson song . fantastic download . cloud is so nice for all my music . thanks amazon for providing such a great service and great selection of music .
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad . i love metallica and wa excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock . however , you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record . my old record have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old , but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level . it is like the speaker wa blown , very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music . oh well , that is what i get for paying only $ 10+ for a vinyl
1	excellent album , prompt delivery .
0	wow . i am really disappointed in this . i guess i am just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this , but the band sound muddled and uninspired . i get the impression they are going through the motion ( which they are ) and could really care le anymore what they put out . roth sound soooooo bad , it is really embarrassing . and i am still not excited about the set list . it is not that it a bad set list , but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore 4 album worth of material a if it never happened and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting . so disappointing . back in the day , vh would play 80-90 % of a new album . they were proud of what they did and dying to show it off . there are song on adkot that are just begging to be played live , but i am guessing well never hear em . shame to put this out and not have cut like big river , you and your blue or beat workn on here ( a terribly retreaded and unoriginal a adkot wa , i still enjoyed the release quiet a bit . i play it often and it ha some great song to workout to . to bad most of them will never see the light of day light . what a shame . i will pas . i own about every vh cd that is been released ( had iii , but got rid of it ) . but i will pas on this one . i will still listen to the studio cut ( heck , daves last solo wa pretty good ) , but i will pas on the live money grab thank you very much .
1	this is an absolutely wonderful cd for all ages- listening to it gave me a sense of being lighter a those stress , that you might not realize your carrying throughout the day , just fall away leaving you with a sense of peace and serenity .
1	memory of bygone day
0	while the package art is nice , i think that is about the best part of this disc . the best song are at the end of the disc , and the new vocalist is o.k. , but not a jon anderson . most of the song on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous . i have listened to this about a dozen time , thinking it would grow on me , but i just do not enjoy it .
0	most song on this album are too similar . i only enjoyed 2 song . not the best album i have bought in a while . i do like sinach , and wa quite disappointed with this one .
1	great song
1	very good quality , price & delivery , well done !
1	this is by far the best collection of rare earth there wa . i say wa co it look like at the writing of this that it is now out of print. ( sad ) . luckily i do own it . what make this the best one of all is the inclusion of every now and then we get to go on down to miami . this song wa never released a a single but should have been . every song on here is a winner , you have got the hit and the best of ( almost ) album track . but if mowtown happens to read this please . please release the entire catalog using 24 bit , these guy deserve it . since there is 2 or 3 original member gone now .
1	some awesome song here .
0	ok , so it ultra new age and designed for meditation , etc . it still doe not work for me but that may be just personal .
0	too short
0	it is a pretty song , with great vocal , but i am not sure about the lyrics/message . once i downloaded and listened to it in it is entirety i wa displeased- sound rather morbid to me . not a great choice for a christmas song . sure it ha a christmas-y sound , but if you really listen , it is not about anything to do with christmas . is it just me , or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far ? i really enjoyed this 25 day of free downloads advent-type calendar last year . i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest . it made for a great collection of christmas song , arrangement i wa not familiar with . this year is disappointing by comparison .
1	jonathan sprout performed at my school when i wa six , and my mother bought me a cassette tape of on the radio . i listened to that tape until it finally broke after year and year of rewinding and replaying , so i wa delighted to come across the digital version of this album on amazon .
1	i am not sure a i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiast , but herere my thought . in the trend of cd re-releases of classic gospel amazing grace , the complete recording offer more than one take on many tune . and that is a good thing ! the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again . and since these are live recording , the spirit move and move . i love aretha , especially here . her voice and spirit soar and we are taken with them . the reverend move u in the way only he can . and let me take a moment here to offer a hallelujah and amen ! for the 1972 southern california community choir . they are with the leader at every turn and their love for our lord come shining through . and that is what a good gospel choir is , my friend . thank you , lord . praise jesus .
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performance of this song . this guy ha a real magic to him . his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison . he will make eye contact with just one person and for just a moment . but you can tell that that person is not likely to forget that moment .
1	it is hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard . there are so many worthy candidate . big star radio city get mentioned a lot . t.rexs electric warrior come to mind . but the frontrunner from the 90 ha got to be mezzanine , a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant . destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison . each track shine in turn . whether it is the single , teardrop , with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal , or the heavy-rock inflected angel and dissolved girl , or the epic show-stopper group four , massive seems a a group with no limitation . and even rap-haters can appreciate 3-d low key , almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson . i would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music , but were not sure where to start . this one is can not -miss .
0	if you like betty boop and fancy the idea of her singing soft ballad you will love this stuff . me . not so much .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	excellent cd
0	home for christmas . sound innocent enough . but you would be well advised to stay away from this home . it is a horrible place . you will be asking santa for some ear plug if you purchase this cd . alternately , you can buy it for people on your christmas list that you do not like or just plain hate . how bad is it ? some say that the cia used it to torture hardened terrorist suspect in guantanamo . it had them babbling like baby in minute . but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland , go ahead and buy it if you must . after all , the man ha a private jet and he is got ta pay for that jet fuel somehow !
0	well i see now it doe say this is a cd . but i am so dissatisfied . i thought richard would be stretching with me . he is not at all . i went to his website to let them know how upset i am the email came back undeliverable .
0	i did not appreciate his bit about joining isi .
1	one of mary well best . no problem with download .
0	sound wa terrible . could not here actor speak because music is too loud
0	this is not the rengades . i am very disappointed . it seems that all the renegade mp3 downloads have the original title but are not the song belonging to that title .
1	an enjoyable mix of cuisine , cultural mix and personal transformation . loved it !
1	christina and blake sound wonderful together ! who would have guessed it . : )
0	the tune were mccartney , the stack on each disc seemed awkward . excluding disc 1 , there were song included that were to be honest pure junk . tune i had never heard and they were poor representative of the career . i guess it is a bit like any other mccartney disc , you are lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense .
1	great album for the linkin park fan .
0	this cd wa terrible . and not just because he is using other artist music , and seemingly getting away with breaking the law ( for now ) . being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon . it is terrible because it is not well done . the transition are terrible . most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song . where is the theme ? it is closer to a 10 second clip sample on random shuffle . i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne , souljah boy , justin beiber , or any name from a slew of non-talented performer who seemed to sell million of record , were in bad taste musically . this cd take that to a whole other level .
0	it hurt to listen to the lp version . this should be erased from existence . the real song is not available in the itunes store usa only the uk itunes store .
0	it would be nice if i could put this song on my player , but it is locked in the stupid cloud and i can not get to it . i am buying future song from itunes .
1	best song of that year . waiting for the next one
0	the song is not the type of song i like . the song lack of energy . i think it is not fun to sing too .
0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival , and loved every single song . based on that , i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it . after hearing these song , i definitely will not be purchasing this album . the girl are definitely beautiful , all right . it is easy to see why they are so well-loved because of it . but on this album , their voice have not matured enough to enjoy listening to , no matter how pretty they are . skip this album and move onto their later work , where they do not sing with little girl voice and their song selection is a little more mature .
0	i think this song is worse than perfect stranger . i am pretty disappointed in this band . i think i am gon na stick to listening to music that i already know or band that are more popular .
0	i cant believe she had the nerve to sing this song ! she doesnt have the style to do so ! i feel the same way about her other remake ! [ . ] ! thalia sure is very pretty but lack so much in talent. , not the best of voice and not the best dancer. , i went to dead or alives concert in san francisco nobody in this planet could sing you spin me round a pete burn doe !
1	this song is a sure thing for when you need a pick me up !
0	this wa purchased for someone else . i do not like it because i think it is an annoying song . not my type of music .
0	i do not know what she is saying . the only reason i assume is because i do know the song silent night . now how do i delete it ?
0	i downloded this song to listen to new music , but it is not my preference . it is a very experimental music for my preference .
1	nice to be able to download an old single song that trigger old memory instead of buying an entire album .
1	brings me back .
1	this came out in the 80 and wa a record of rerecordings of their hit . it is for completists like me . i think the new version are great ! but there is no cd for this one . i wish they would put out the rest of their early stuff . but this one will do if you want the band doing great version of their song . with mark l too .
1	excellent album
1	great .
1	a fun song from it time
1	excellent
0	i buy the song but they never let me download it into my computer
0	this is b , the purpous of digital music is to choose what song you want and not forced to buy an entire album .
0	this say it is the clean version but it is not .
1	product delivered a described . ship time wa expected .
1	love this song . it is truly magic ! my fave coldplay song in a while . looking forward to the rest of the album .
0	t.c . elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge ( the album and the movie ) . his delivery wa excellent , so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut . unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark . the first single miss thang wa good . good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle ( anyone else remember cassette single ? ) the rest of the album wa mediocre . t.c . elli had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of true confession . it is possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang , which explains the 2 song ; miss thang and cold thang . however , even with decent sample and beat , the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish . a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog ( and list the godfather of funk a producer ) ; excellent beat and nice hook - but the delivery by t.c . wa anything but funky . the title track wa an extension of t.c.s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album . not enough to save the album however .
1	mc flepp ( roman flepp ) from liricas analas rap in romansh ( sursilvan ? ) and graubnden swiss-german . i am not a romansh speaker . i will say i am a student of german so i find it really cool whenever i can make out small bit of the swiss-german : ) . i think romansh is a very lovely , musical language , very pleasing to the ear , and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue . the beat are planned really well , flepp ha a voice that ( imho ) is perfect for his music , and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility . he go through a lot of different style , from mellow to jazzy . very refreshing . guest include liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoon on musica .
1	i am in love
0	just not what i expected .
1	this song is a true testimony for me , with god i do have the victory
0	no one need evil
1	california love the greatest song of all time why everybody go to cali it is mostly the west coast , a for me florida is almost like california , i live in orlando which is mostly part of central florida . especially all part around the sunshine state .
0	not a bad bond title song . but no excuse why this is not on soundtrack cd . adele should be boycotted . barbara should be ashamed of herself causing cubby to roll over in his grave .
1	it is a good song with nice lyric . the beat is slow jam style . may help ppl understand to listen to their mate before the relationship come to an end .
0	i am truly a j-hud fan and have waited for this cd forever . it wa a truly let down for me with a few exception if it is not love , my heart , i am his only woman , invisible and naturally spotlight best song on the cd ! i am shocked that this is what clive davis had in mind for her . even though kelly clarksons my december had one hit on it and davis told her to start over and she said no . i would rather jennifer to of done it her way then his . but i still love ya jenn hopefully better next time ! for now i will be listening to her solo off of the dreamgirls soundtrack simply because love you i do is more like stuff she should be doing .
0	it would not download properly . cant hear it !
0	this version suck ! i accidentally ordered it instead of damien rice . i am pissed at wasting $ 1.29 . no cancelling i guess .
0	i am not sure what those who gave this 4 or 5 star are thinking . this is awful ! i realize there will always be sycophant of certain band who are so enamored with them they will always rate 5 star when it is painfully obvious 5 star are not in order . this is certainly one of those time . this cd is horrific , and that is being charitable . i love old van halen - they are among my all-time faves . but this ? who , in their right mind , can give this crap 3 star , much le 4 or 5 ? dlr sound terrible ! reprehensible . i will not even go into the sammy v david argument since i never really cared for the hagar year . i love sammy a a solo artist , but did not care for his work with van halen , but i prefer his mediocre work with them to roth garbage now .
0	made in aut in 1996 , serial # 33215-2 , playing time 51:45 this is album # 9 from canada self-proclaimed metal queen , and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album . emotional rain , her previous album , displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor , but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre . i like la singing , and la & 2p demonstrates her talent . but everything around that is a great disappointment . from the opening note of the first track , in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage ( maybe it wa ) , i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe : the instrumentation is basic , poorly recorded , but mostly pointless : it is music without melody or purpose , and even though some of the arrangement are at time ( but rarely ) adequate , you will not be captivated by any of it . this album wa a 1-off : her latest , slick chick , is a tribute to swing : talk about lack of constant direction ! perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous album , since they will have nothing to compare it with . but if you are somewhat familiar with album like powerline , bodyrock or metal queen , be careful this time : try to borrow a copy from someone else first , or listen to some song sample : this is no traditional lee aaron .
0	please stop playing this song a hold music ! is your goal to get me to hang up ?
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all . the illusion and wit wa better than nothing ( plain stupidity ) , and while this album may be slightly deeper , it is not an improvement . i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that . his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok. the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam-rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem ( i would hate to see him live ) . in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan . fyi - i wa not in love with their first album , so this ha nothing to with expectation . and i did not hate their last album , so i am not solely a killer basher . overall - 4/10 , i pronounce the killer dead . wait ! it seem some still think the are the best thing ever ( you know you are in love if you like flower voice ) . p.s . while the song when you were young is pretty good , it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid .
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre , but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk . it is even above that silent night one that wa re-covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone ! i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior through song .
1	it doe not disappoint . at all . not even a little bit . i am beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong . brilliant !
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack . the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time . however , a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound , the music here is strong throughout the cd ( and the movie ) . in addition to the main theme , the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite . it is pretty simple : if you are a big fan of the movie , you will highly enjoy this sound track . if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie , you will also like this soundtrack . strongly recommended .
0	still a glorious voice . but the arrangement suck . too lounge-y . only a piano when some of these require lush arrangement .
0	the item wa ( it ) broken
0	it did nothing for me , i lost not one pound .
1	what a voice , do not really have to say any more .
0	if you are a tango dancer or d.j. , looking for a collection of the most danced-to tango in either the u.s. or argentina , you will be sorely disappointed with this collection . it contains few , if any , of the the essential golden era hit . instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure , non-danced-to , listening-only tango : early gardel , piazzola , etc . that you would almost never want to play at a milonga . calling the collection 50 essential tango is misleading at best . avoid it .
1	good song .
0	listening to this cd , all the way through , wa neither easy nor enjoyable . if you like beat-driven pop with repetitious lyrical hook , you might like 0304. if you are expecting to be touched by another excellent jewel collection , prepare to have your heart broken . this cd truly disappointed everyone i know who ha heard it . it is pure pop drivel .
0	the sound quality of this cd is awful . can not imagine what it would be like if it had not been remasterd .
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
1	a good song you don t hear everyday . a great song for those who are in love for the first time !
0	a many people may know by now , sony wa recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased cd ( van zant : get right with the man ) from sony music not only installed drm software ( digital right management , to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain device ) , but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from window , and opened the system up to security issue such a virus . this cd ha the same copyright protection , called xcp . when installed , sony hijack your computer and installs custom software which : 1 ) hide itself entirely from window by installing a a rootkit 2 ) hide itself in such a manner that any file begining with $ sys $ are also hidden . for example , if you install the xcp copy protection software on your machine , and rename document.doc to $ sys $ document.doc it then becomes invivisble to you forever . 3 ) installs it own custom cd-rom driver to hijack your system . it also sneakily name these driver plug and play device manager to seem a if it is a part of window . trying to delete these driver manually will disable your cd-rom drive entirely . 4 ) offer no uninstall option until you manually contact sony a of my writing this review , sony ha apologized for this incident , and claim they will re-evaluate this copyright protection software on their cd in the future . in the meantime , a virus is currently running wild , which name itself begining with $ sys $ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanner . several class action lawsuit are also pending against sony right now . in summary , a you can tell from above , sonys action here are absolutely horrible . this is your music . you purchased it , and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it , let alone install software which compromise your system security . this is one of the cd with sonys xcp copyright protection software on it , and a a result , you should not buy it to send a message to sony that this will not be tolerated in the future .
0	wow . do not know what happened here . usually i have no problem with amazon downloads , but this one suck . not crisp . instead it is got a fuzzy , dull quality . doe terrible justice to this excellent tune .
1	old school music . the best from puerto rico . isla del encanto . bonita perla bonito san juan buenos recuerdos del pasado
0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol . i had heard this song on the radio ( probably too much ? ) and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today . i have to say i like the song , but the ending is really [ . ] . of course now given the whole chris brown thing it make me feel disgusted about him in general , but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability . and it seems to go along tooooo long . i know you can both sing . modern day air supply . blech . but might appeal to a lot of people . just not me . just my opinion : )
1	this second single from the new album rise ( releasing june 25 ) is more of a power ballad . john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song , but it is still a good song with a great message , of letting love cut through the noise of our culture . if you are familiar with skillet , think along the line of lucy ( although american noise is not a story song ) . if you are not familiar with the band , just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80 rock band .
1	well packaged and good response . great quality , thanks !
1	i thought it wa fabulous ! i am the same age a barbra and knew she wa going to be something special the first time i heard back when . this is her best yet .
0	i downloaded the amazon player and everything and it will not play . waste of my 0.89 ! i will stick with itunes from now on .
0	buyer beware , this is only a sample of the track . it is only a 20 second clip . not worth $ 1 !
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
0	music is terrible to boot .
1	great cd . this is the only cd i have found with so many great song on one disc . usually there are a couple good hit along with average or below average hit . from start to finish this cd will have you saying i have forgotten how great that song is . definitely recommend to any 70 music fan .
1	this is some good music , right here ! larue is a vocal beast . i had the pleasure of being at the live recording and i wa blown away with her vocal , the background vocal and the band . everything wa on point . the music a easy to follow and i did not feel cheated when it came to ministry . although it wa the recording for her cd , she still stayed with the ministry element and tear were flowing , hand were praised , and praise were being given to the father . in listening to the cd , it take me right back to the point in time when our hand were raised , eye closed , dancing , clapping and just praising . i love to worship and i do not want to leave this place will have you with the ugly cry ( smile ) . do not sleep on this one . and , when she minister , you can see that she ha a heart for god and god people . support her ministry . it is well worth every dime .
0	what is wrong with record company these day ? everytime you turn around there is yet another greatest hit , ultimate , essential , box set or whatever hit package that basically consist of all the same song , give or take one or two exception . this hit package is no different . amy fan , you already have all this - there is no need to buy it . what is up with amy anyway ? what audience is she trying to speak to ? her old christian audience , pop audience , adult comtemporaray audience , all of them ? she is all over the place . i think everyone is kinda over it . she ha a great career - nothing to be dissapointed with . it is just time to retire . for example - i dindt even know this wa released . never heard anything about it . it wa never promoted - probably because there is nothing to promote .
1	the best song were from the 80 and this is no exception . i heard this before the whole how i met your mother hype and it ha always been a fun song to jam along to , especially in the car .
0	not what i expected and some song so sad i cried .
0	this song wa purchased my mistake by my son . i have never really been into it . i have to learn to lock my phone . lol
1	i would ask people to purchase beyonce if they like this artist . music is an individual choice and should be treated a such .
1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska , i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy . i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were . in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention . in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a & e special concert promoting the bee gee album , this is where i came in . naturally , i stayed to watch . and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique , amazing and thrilling voice i would ever heard in my life . from that moment on i bought every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice . and what a rewarding journey that was- his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice . obviously , the huge album from the seventy did not interest me much , despite their genius danceability , because his voice is not highlighted . fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album . i have often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he had not been shaped by the bee gee . often i yearned for something more than the pop song . after all , his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre . this album come the closest to proving that . just listen to do not cry alone if you do not believe me . and while many of the track are once again pop , they are more mature , both in lyric and in vocal . and i love that he us his terrific range from one song to the next . i especially love it when he sings in the lower register ( sanctuary ) , since he doe it so rarely- but so well . naturally , if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you are going to buy this album . if you are simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of- if not the- most unique , haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history . this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice .
1	fine product
0	i think it is a shame that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echo of eternity . this is by far the worst cd i have gotten in a long time , and the first that made me write a review . the singer may be the worst i have ever heard . even my cat cd sound better . i am very bitter about the $ 15 i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music .
1	awesomeness love this song very inspiring and heart felt , i could listen to it all day it make my heart so filled with the spirit .
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed . the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl . that might be true , but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with . there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song . not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album . they all are a mediocre at best rating . nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of . usually i like when jackyl do cover version , but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh , not a song i liked before and still do not . the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one , but then again , how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song ? enough with the rev it up and go already . the same can be said for just because i am drunk . it is just a watered down version of secret of the bottle . i do not get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs ? the song sound silly with lyric rally , rally , rally , uga , chugga , ugga chugga . really ? wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that 20 year old dancing baby animation thing ? not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together . this album ha failed to rock me , roll me or jackly me off in any way . sure , the production is good , but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish . the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doe not seem right for jackyl . it sound more like them trying anything to keep current , and thats not why fan stick with them . i have not given up hope , and think jackyl can still bounce back , but they sure are not the same band they once where . they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great . nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic .
0	bad , eddy voice is shot .
1	this song is beautiful beyond word .
1	love this song
0	the orchestral piece have a lot of white noise in the background and many song cut off half way through .
1	can you wait , love this song . have been waiting on this cd to come out for a long time . worth the wait .
0	i do not know what this album is going to sound like for katy perry ! , but i know for sure i am not going to hear the rest of katy ! quit writing song about split and divorce with russell brand ! get on with life and write some better tune . roar and walking on air is definitely keeper ! if you do not improve i will not buy one more thing from you ! sorry sweetheart ! lady gaga # 1 ! so there ! slut !
1	meek mill traumatized hit too close to home a i have recently lost my mother and took over her position . polo and shell top also meant a lot to me .
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
1	an excellent series with a theme that really capture the feel of the series . definately recommend especially to lover of the series
0	boring
0	i like to pick out 3 song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program . i can not find 1 here . just when i think i like what i am hearing they find a way to blow the deal . almost every song is overplayed . talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road . recalculating ! weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd . they can surely play but need some serious direction . will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid . these guy could use his help , and get a singer . could end up being somebody .
1	love it
1	i remembered this song one day . and began researching it online . my flate ather once owned the vinyl record . he frequently played different genre of music music around the house . i grew up loving all kind of music . i have not heard this song since childhood . the vinyl record of course is lost now . this digital song wa sung by much the same/similar original artist i would listened to growing up . it brought back wonderful memory of happy childhood day .
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage . i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it . sound like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40. i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first 3 album .
1	one of my son really wanted this song and think it is 5 star for sure !
1	great
0	but this album is horrible , only one fairly decent song on the entire cd.do not buy it you are wasting your hard earn money on this .
1	still a dynamic and sexy song from an amazing artist ,
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
1	only ha a 7 song but i love them all he sound just like he did when i fell in love with him on sunday best . it is nice to hear a nice young fresh and new voice singing the word of god they could not have picked a better title for the album it wa well done and i have been waiting for it most of the song he performed on sunday best are on here tracklist 1.god in me- joshua put his youth flava and some gospel hiphop singing the mary mary hit 2.we expect you- one of the song that helped him one sunday best 3.rain on us- josh go off on this song you can feel every word he sings with so much power on this one 4.i am still standing- that signature joshua rogers sound with the scat and run : ) 5. in the middle- he say before the song start that he is about to jam and he doe just that 6.peace be still- seems like youngbuck channeled kim burrell on this record i thought it wa her at first lol 7.well done- the album finish with well done * clap hand * congrats young buck for winning sunday best and putting out ya first album can not wait to hear more and some original song
1	love dangelo and this song . this one of those song you can enjoy anywhere , sitting with your special someone thinking this is about u or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying it melody , doe not matter it just a great song . d angelos style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy make me happy . five star from me .
1	this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best song on this soundtrack are all of them . if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
0	please do not waste your money on this recording . it sound a though it were input to the computer sequencer without any regard to tempo on continuity . a very un-musical album .
1	great album ! they have such wonderful voice . i wish i could sing like that .
0	i purchased this song along with 4 other song and all but this one completed the download . i tried to cancel this song order , but could not . therefore i paid for this song that did not download . no way to try a second time without paying for the song again and taking the chance it will not download again . oh well .
0	seth ! man , who broke your heart. ? your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety , and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time . but still , neither is enough to let me sit through 17 song of depression , loneliness , pining , cry . in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note . but your failed . unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river , i can not recommend this , not even a background dinner music . bring back the happy , swingin , cool seth , please . !
1	i love everything adele sings .
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule . whatever happened to good old-fashioned church music ? i am serious . this type of music , known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet . i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano . nirvana wa not a good band . the lead yeller committed suicide , which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan . if you are like me , you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever . i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself a my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church .
0	i expected more musical growth from the band .
1	i just really like this song .
0	lost and alone
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me . west is another great group of song !
1	for lover of david arkenstone and others on the windham hill label , this album is a keeper . very relaxing and peaceful , while not putting you to sleep . i love to work late at night and this music is great for that .
0	the song is great , but the quality of the download from amazon is absolutely horrendous . i will never purchase music from amazon again . very disappointed .
1	i purchased the presale album . two song are available immediately . i think this may be their best album yet !
1	his father is known a high caliber musician , and his son is confirming the line of great and amazing artistic work . great cd for music collection . r .
0	when it ha came down to beyonce knowles , and today diva , she ha became the most overexposed product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice ha died and so ha she in song . but nevertheless , when she wa a part of destiny child , she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart . her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work , and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay-z . they have had other collaboration for her career like the wasted deja vu , and the recent drunk in love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart , and bonnie & clyde 03. it is not a good song , because it ha been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband . still , there need to be better in voice and being crazy in love . song : d+
1	a good mix of common song from merry england ! - i particularly enjoyed the sound of a man from the 16th century bemoaning all of the progress and newfangled fashion that were destroying the heart of the england he knew .
1	i heard this gentleman sing on huckabee one night and i loved his voice . i immediately went to amazon to find the song and get it .
0	lucinda williams , the finest songwriter of the century , need to return to the great song she wrote in the beginning of her career . the only song on west that i really liked wa west . i will continue to buy all her album anyway , i think she is great !
0	ok , jason moran is a piano virtuoso . if you still did not know , this is a reason to listen to this work . the problem come when you are looking for something else . this album is a jazz trio , but what about the other two ? well , overshadowed by the soloist . although better that way , and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise : the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed . to top it off , the theme included in this album are dull and flat .
1	while the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few track took me back to dylan juda moment , i still recommend this wonderful series . my baby fell asleep within 20 minute of first firing it up , and hopefully ha planted some subliminal love for the pixy to share with me in the future . the stone one is good too . but mike , please remove the electric from monkey go to heaven , for u purist .
1	great
0	this particular sky record digital album is being sold without jarboes approval . do not support this particular download .
1	amazing album been with j. cole since the warm-up , good to see he still keep it real .
1	i found this binaural suggestion online and have been able to get to sleep much more easilywith this in the background .
1	awsome song !
0	and i say that so loosely . this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar-coated fluff . i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance , but this one grate on my nerve . first . copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do ! not original and we had enough of that song . that is what this song totally ride on ! at least chris brown , even though it is a similar beat , ha something going for his song , with you ( better lyric , nice video ) . altogether , i just do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though . come on ! we heard it enough in 2006/2007 ! second . i will never forget you/you are in everything i do/ ( later ) just like a tattoo/i will always have you blah , blah , blah , blah , jordin . start writing your own song and maybe you will get some attention ! 2.25 star . end note : beautiful voice but get a new producer who is not afraid to try something new and different ! i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but ( and that is a b i g but ) copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do ! the lyric are trite and super-elementary and nothing ( i mean nothing ) besides the vocal work stand out !
1	great cd
0	i must have been one of the unlucky one that got a flawed cd . it skip like crazy . also , the plastic cd case came apart when opening . needle to say it wasnt a stress-free experience .
0	this cd is heavy duty sad . if you are a heroin addict , this cd may cheer you up . i only liked one song on the cd and i am a lucinda fan . this is not a feel-good cd .
0	i wa unable to download this mp3 without downloading software i do not want ( amazon music player ) . i already have a music player , and it work fine . i just wanted a favorite tie song .
0	a vile song from a vile album that glorifies adultery and a family destroyed . leanns action during and after her affair ha cost her many fans-me being one of them .
1	i love everything she ha ever done . i periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one .
0	ok
1	this item exceeded expectation ! bought a a gift for a family member for enjoyment and daily use . recommend this item .
1	good quality but you have to download amazing music to have to song in you phone
0	another balcony sacrifice . they should be ashamed of themselves
1	nice ! i play it when cleaning up the house ! nice blend of music ! some folk can relate to what i am talking about . : )
0	i do not understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today . he is a cut above in the vocal department - he doe not need to do this . i am not a fan of his song selection and the direction he is gone in his career , with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock , where he shine , in my opinion . but , i adore him and his fearlessness . he is obviously doing what he love and just because it doe not resonate with me doe not mean it is not worthwhile . i just wish he would do more ballad , song with deeper lyric and let u hear raw adam in all it natural beauty .
0	so . now you do not pay to download an actual file , you pay to listen to one song at a time in yet another music playing app ? i already pay for spotify , i only wanted an mp3 to make into a ringtone . this is 100 % useless to me .
1	beautiful voice
0	i am sure he ha other good cd , but i have not found it yet .
1	i am so in love with this song . clay vocal surpass in this beautifully written song . if you have not bought it yet , go buy it . you will love it also !
1	the best cd i have ever had
1	i found this worship cd in a store randomly . it ha some of the best praise and worship song ever . i can not help but get up and praise my god when i hear these song . what a blessing !
0	i am a big rage fan , and wanted the edited version to play while i drive a school bus . i paid $ 9 for all the clean version on amazon . imagine my surprise when i found they were not edited ! i contacted amazon and wa given a refund , and told them about the error . make sure you get what you pay for !
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing . back in 2003 when jewel did , it wa a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u wa also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality . also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next , it will fit her voice well .
0	not great
0	this cd set is okay but get a little monotonous after a while . i wa hoping it would be better but it is okay .
1	recording quality is not that great .
1	now memory run with this a night at a local hotel packed with people and trying to get a drink of course i wa wearing the black dress .
1	fun music . make you feel lighthearted and free . and it wa free . music ha a mix of jazzy , to indie to rap .
1	great song about god
1	i love this song !
0	i generally like starbombs music , for what it is . and what it is is a blend of pop , rap , video game parody , and novelty music . a far a those quality go , the artist have not deviated from their theme . however , compared to the first starbomb album , i felt this wa a huge step down . the song just are not a unique , comical , or lively . aside from smash ! , the track are pretty forgettable . some of the song make reference to the previous album , which might seem like a nice touch , but i felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia . i still bought the album to support egoraptor , whose video game review on youtube i love . bought i can not really recommend this album otherwise .
0	yee haw , wen de music biziniss iz filled with kommy fashist amerikah hater like de dixy chiks and sistum uf a down . dese fokes dun come out and dun speke to u tru amerikans , the 20 % uf u dat are left . we do not nede yur bush-bashin you 70 % + uf amerkah , you dun just git out of amerkah and dun moov to kuba ! yee haw ! i dun tell yu wut , this musik iz a breth uf fresh air to all de bush bashers ! just dun git , ither you dun support a prezident ( only if he repubilikan of course ) or you dun leave ! unless the prezident iz a kommy fashist demokrat , than it is okay to bash him becuss hez demokrat ! yee haw ! jeezus approovs of dis war , why on de sermon on de mount he dun said blessed are de pecemakers , an inturpretashion of dat meant that blessed are those who dun start unnessessary war to fin out peeplez numberz so dat so few left hav no choise but be peceful ! fredtowntard out !
1	love it !
1	my daughter love carrie underwood and ha all of her cd .
0	clean version ,
0	the song is great the mp3 stink amazon ha it tagged so you have to use their player to get it to work . it is not a stand alone mp3 . i do not think i will be buying anymore mp3s from amazon .
1	i hated their voice at first , and i hated the lyric . but i listened to the whole thing twice , and it actually is kinda catchy . but everyone is different . for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it really just depends on how the music ring inside your ear .
1	i stumbled upon lp searching for vinyl record on youtube and nearly fell over when i started listening . she is absolutely incredible and ha affected me more than any artist in year !
1	i love this album ! it is my new favorite .
0	she can not even do a soft song without it being at the schubert or oneil theater . i would suggest you get the ala carte from her massive library here at itunes . there are some great thing .
0	what is it with this guy ? will he ever have the gut to release another album without a greatest hit package tagged onto this new material . this guy for 10 year ha re-released the same old music ! the one time he did not with a $ 70 million budget , invincible only sold 2 million copy in the usa . even though his $ 70 million budget wa directed to only marketing in the usa . why doe not everyone go to cnet.com , go to the downloads section & get yourself a free mp3 cd ripper ! then get jackson first 4 solo album or really any of his album , make copy of them & then burn your own cd of your own personal choice of song ! that in a nutshell is what michael jackson ha done for 10 year ! he know his new stuff cant stand on it own so then we need greatest hit package tagged on or just release : box set , number one , etc , etc . i have never seen another guy live off his past more then him ! word to the wise , get yourself a free mp3/cd ripper , rip your already owned old material and make your own cd with different selection . because that is all he is doing !
1	terry kath in his heyday jamming over a funky vamp before transitioning into bobby lamms bluesy ballad . loud , raw , and improvisational gibson s-g handiwork make this tune my favorite early chicago piece of work , circa , 1969 .
0	i am a huge manowar fan since 1982. i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm . i have seen the band live probably 12 time both in the u and in europe , and have met them personally on occasion . it pain me to say it but this album is horrid . yes , the production is poor but that is not the main problem . the song themselves would not have made any of teh previous album . ( i liked god of war ) . this is the first manowar album i have heard ( and i have heard them all - many time ) that lay totally flat , sound bad , and doe not have a single song that i find worthy . i would not expect many , or any , of these track to make it to a live show . i am still a fan of the band , i always will be , but i need to call it what it is ; horrid .
1	i have got to admit , i have had this cd since it first came out . i am just writing a review now , better late than never . i give the cd is 5 star . yes it is a mellow cd , but it is awesome . just like paul stanley 1978 kiss solo cd , ( my personal favorite ) wa the most mellow of the four , his song i feel were the stongest . just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song , the vocal and the playing is top notch . paul is a master craftsman of song . he always writes the best music , then put his songcrafting ability to it . definatly a 5 star cd . this is paul stanley at his best . rock on .
0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment , and i despaired of having a flawless product . the cd came through in perfect condition however . i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk . when i played the cd , i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection , so i will not be able to use it any longer for my walk . unfortunately , i had to open the package in order to determine this , so i am out of luck a far a returning it is concerned ! too bad they did not leave a great product a it wa . sadly , it is not going to be my favorite any more .
0	not quite what i expected
1	i am in love with this : ) .
1	beautiful , haunting and take me back in time . ani williams is the best when it come to doing her version of egyptian music . her music just feel right
1	i love it !
0	i am sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great band like killswitch engage , in flame , a i lay dying , lamb of god , ect . now thats real music . not this crap . the only reason this guy even popular is because he got shot nine time . in a few year rap will die just like disco . then metal will rule the world once again .
1	i do not know why this song wasnt a bigger hit . it ha always been one of my favorite . it is very evocative .
1	another hit !
1	fantastic i love it love it love it , della lift the heart & stir the soul . i start my day with this if at all possible , praise god ! it is best to give your day to the lord , this is the way to do it . i reccommended it highly . jojo
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him . their review seem a little biased at best . the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music , it doe so in the most generic way possible . nothing here is really worth listening to more than once , and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it . no fresh or exciting take here , just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern . dannys voice doe not help matter much . it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it . it is too bad actually , if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album . a such it fall short of even that . if you know ( of ) danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it . if you do not know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you . all others would be better served looking up marty robbins , george jones or hank williams to get the real deal .
1	this is one of the better collection out there . some very hard to find song on this wonderful 3 cd set . come in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these day . most multi-cd set case are flimsy and fall apart quickly . not this one . this is a bargain . it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd .
1	i just discovered rosi golan . o lucky me ! she sings song of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare . such longing so beautifully expressed . innocent . she us the minor mode in a way that express this longing and this innocence perfectly . with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything , that it must be real and true love , and that such love doe exist . all the song are wonderful but i especially recommend come around , think of me , and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart of real love . thank you rosi
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd . i should have demoed the song before ordering , but i do like the disco song that are not available for download .
0	lee morgan , quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road , and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year . when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling . the brilliance of his tone is there , but his idea have not yet been fully developed . plus , cliff jordan playing , the senior side man on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to . altogether , a a maiden voyage , this is just a mediocre record . lee wa to make his mark later . one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent , written by bassist eddie higgins . otherwise , there is little to recommend here . two star
1	man i wore this cd out when i wa a kid . and the music is timeless . best compelation i ever had and i got it with a burrito . you do not get any better than that .
0	you can buy a cd same price with 73 track on it .so if you have not got that .then do not buy this nokia site a the album on download
0	i do not have this song on my music and i did not order this song must take charge off. ? and hate to write such lengthy review
0	a a fan of tso . we were looking forward to this new 2 cd set with great anticipation . when it arrived , we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed . although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso , this concept left u very cool . there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise . we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste , but i must say this one wa a bust . we never listen to it and had we previewed it , would definitely never have purchased it .
1	it is one of my favorite son from the 80
1	great shipping time ! product a described .
1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over , then you know you have got a good album . eisleys unique sound is so soothing , refreshing , and at the same time slightly rockin . i would say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard , with girl vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine . like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper . and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony . every song ha it moment of pure joy and satisfaction . it just make you feel good . simply put , it just good listening . good music for the ear .
0	junk . the cd came without a case and wa broken . who would buy a cd without a case . who would & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/embers/dp/b003ntk4e2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > ember < /a > & nbsp ; sell a cd without a case .
0	this ha to be the worst holiday song ever made . i can not believe anyone would actually pay for this . i would not even download it for free .
1	my 3.5 year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable-channel music station . it is now a frequent player . he here is dozen of song a day , but this one wa a sticky one .
1	leann rime is one of my favorite artist to begin with . no dislike , loved everything about this song . recommended to anyone who need rapture .
1	yes , music is soothing and pleadsnt
0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review . east . 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac wack . that is blasphemy right there . he wa a real a it get , he had quite a few positive song , and he wa one of the greatest ! anyone would agree with me there . on to my review of this cd . i weep at the current state of hip hop . how did we go from notorious big to lil flip ? hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it is pathetic . 50 cent doe not help one bit . yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson on going multiple time platinum . but why did this album sell so much ? i think it wa based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he wa shot nine time and lived to tell . i mean anyone who say 50 is a lyrical beast is totally assinine . this guy is so predictable ! let u see , if he talk about selling rock he will probably mention something about glocks in the next few word . and if he mention hoe he will probably mention about him doing show . and if he mention . you get my point . he is such a bad lyricist . if he came outta the south i would understand but coming from queen ? ny is respected a the breeder of lyrical genius but 50 is trash . stop talking about how ( . ) ja rule is ! he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed ! you are the wanksta 50 cuz u never got back at him ! this album get it 2 star because the beat are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guy living off of his 9 shot story . i love how people gave him the name 5-0 and called 50 a snitch cuz it true . new title for this album get ( . ) or die cry
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons line in the 1997 film a good a it get , you make me wan na be a better man , this song embodies what a woman want in a relationship . from the opening note , you will be sucked into the melody and simple lyric that comprise wan na make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day . although this song is not written by gibson himself , it doe expose music lover to his rich vocal that tickle your ear drum . stay tuned for gibson next single ( written by gibson himself ) summer back set to be released this month .
1	fine cd .
0	almost no metal behind this cd .
0	pop
1	such a beautiful song
0	when i gave this album 3 star at one time ? ! after listening to az , then listening to this , a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch , this album is a bad a it get . first off this guy bite off everything in his site ! the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die , just longer . the only reason why he is famus is because he got shot 9 time , and he is a fool on stereroids . he is all over the medium , and is an annoyment on mtv and bet ! anyway on the album , his lyric are childish , and nursery rhyme , along with a lame horrible flow , with good beat , but putting him on the track made em sound bad . he is a million mile away from being pac , and ja rule ha a good chance of beating him . if you like pop rap , odds are you brought it , and after reading this review , you hate me . but for those who like real hip hop , understand this is garbage , and is doe not even to deserve to be called a rapper from queen ( na , az , and , mobb deep hold true to the queensbridge name ) it is not even worth 50 cent itself . it doesnt even deserve to be on the shelf ! interesting fact : this fool dissin ja rule , yet he is copying jas style ! i mean he ha a fake gangsta image , and club song , love song , and he acually sings song , imitating ja rule . and also , he used pac rhyme on the hail mary remix from tupacs song hail mary , and against all odds , to dis ja while using tupacs rhyme for exploitation . what a joke , a discrace , and a cancer to hip-hop . ( just like chingy , juelz santana ( he ha good beat , but his rhyme are completly senseless , ludacris , g-unit , j-kwon , bow wow , and u know who else ) peace
0	the album is great . the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa made for crosley , and sound like isht . oh well , at least it look cool in white
1	my 6 year old grandaughter had the volume up for hour while she played the cd . she will be listening to it for a long time . grammpa
1	honestly , i wa never a huge fan of this song , the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me , but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song , one of his favorite , he think it is really romantic etc . . . . not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day . i have always known the lyric were romantic , but they have more meaning for me now . also , this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version . his voice doe not bother me now . just go to show how important recording quality really is .
0	wanted the song with the word . this is just instrumental .
0	i have been a dylan fan from way back . and , i am also a big sinatra fan . i write this review from that perspective . what ha happened to american culture , that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer ? are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence ? anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra , and how he did these song . and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all , getting by , because they are supposedly emoting . frankly , this cd is strictly emperor new clothes . to put it bluntly , it is awful , no matter what critic , with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra , are saying . and no , dylan doe not make these song his own . such rationalization for lousy singing ! . dylan ha taken some of sinatra best - i am a fool to want you , where are you ? why try to change me now ? and trivialized them . not recommended for dylan fan , and certainly not recommended for sinatra fan !
1	great song and i am an 80 metalhead . that is saying something .
1	this a great cd by two great artist . it is pure country , both vocal and the music are outstanding .
1	it wa just what i wonted to the t. the sound wa great and the price wa ok . wish it wa buy one get one .
0	once i would downloaded this song , i felt deceived by the sample clip available here . cincotti definitely ha potential , but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range . he sounded rather screechy . the title track wa also somewhat misleading , because it led me to expect a slow , tender seduction song , not a sad one . i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing .
1	my dad really love these guy and he wa going crazy over this song so i decided to get it for him .
0	to country
1	this song brings back memory of my teenage year . i love most of their music anyway . they sure can sing !
1	a advertised . very nice .
0	i did not order this item and it appeared on my computer one day . some may like it , but i did not . thanks .
0	crap for idiot
1	obviously a classic !
0	nothing new here , except the packaging . this collection is the first time inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album that is why god made the radio . the reason i highlight single is because , what the heck is a single these day ? although there wa actually a 45 rpm 7 vinyl single issued of that is why god made the radio , it wa just issued only for , probably , collector like me . the other new single , is not it time , only exists on the album . back in the day of top 40 radio , we called these album track , not single . included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibration . come on guy , is not it time that a stereo mix officially come out ? most beach boy song were recorded on state of the art for those time , recording equipment . also included are several more should be stereo mono track : do it again , surfin safari , i get around , the little girl i once knew , help me , rhonda , fun , fun , fun , and of course , good vibration . unexplicably missing is their first hit surfin , plus many of their biggest hit like be true to your school and of course their holiday season hit . also included are some non-hit album track . listenning to the mono track , most sound like early cd , tinny and bassy , and are definitely not remixed . i do not think that brian would ever have okd these without at least re-eqing them . on the plus side , included are 7 black & white photo of the beach boy in their younger day , pre-gray , fat and bald . each disc come in it is own sleeve , disc 1 : their young day and disc 2 : the old fart . there is also a nice booklet ( which could easily fit in a jewel case ) . both cd look like mid-60s swirl label capitol 45s . the sound is great and doe offer many of their best song .
1	my son came to me one day with tear in his eye playing this song on his phone . he said he only had one request of me , dad , promise me that if i should pas before you that you will play song at my funeral . well what could i say but , only if you will do the same for me son . very touching day for u . thanks guy .
1	a golden oldie for sure
0	did not order , do not know why it is showing up on my account .
1	oh yes ! this is one of tjose song where if you need a little bit encouragement just pop it on and a the title say just let it go .
0	i hate you i hate you i hate you . i had a credit and i tried to use it for two song . they got sent to 2 different folder . now it say the download took too long . and i lost my $ and the song . you stink , amazon . make it easier to spend my own damn money . thanks .
1	could not believe there were no 5 star review . this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many . love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder . had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play , it wa so nice to find on cd . also bought a copy for my daughter , who also love it
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
1	country continues to turn out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach . adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song , which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier who lost their life in various war . this is a poignant and important recording , and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric .
0	the song that i wanted is cut off and doe not end correctly . it stop in the middle of a phrase . i could not use it .
1	good song .
0	paul taylor music is not the same a when i bought his earlier cd . the music is not a great a it wa before .
0	i really expected to be blown away by this album . it wa one of the best selling record the year it came out , and this record cemented lil wayne a one of the biggest rapper on the planet . you could not turn the tv on without seeing him or this record . however , there were only 3 or so song that i liked . the other song just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me . this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyric , but maybe the producing . clearly , the guy is talented , but the record just came across a bland and repetitive to me . his 2006 release with birdman wa slammin . i expected this record to sound a little closer to that . obviously , i am in the minority here , a the rest of the world can not get enough of this record .
1	i think it a different side of beyonce , i feel she is confessing her love for jay z and how they compliment each other by saying that she isdrunk in love , great record and very sexy video
0	i loose the money awful
0	am sorry i purchased the cd . music is slow a drag . not the usual upbeat christmas music .
0	completely different than any of her older album . if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit , this is not the album for you .
0	the first and only album i have not liked from floyd since final cut
0	mediocre compared to other tribute . just did not enjoy these rendition the same way i have other vsq performance
1	bought this for secret but am getting hooked on the rest . still a timely cd . came on time and in a bubble envelope . worth a purchase for sure .
1	who can explain god love ? well , hallorin doe a great job . this song touch my soul and brings tear to my eye every time i listen to it . although we mess up , god clean u up and restores u . his love is not of this world . hallelujah !
0	i downloaded this and it start over in the middle of the download a bad one this one and it still cost me so watch when getting this song !
0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music . i also find toilet humor funny like most men . however , i find this cd completely pointless and tedious . it is not at all funny , and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found . every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same - a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a 14-year-old over unclassifiable , unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally . i suppose some folk would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea , but for those ( like me ) who think these would be selling point , trust me , they aint .
0	i tried to purchase this song on the amazon app for blackberry but instead of getting this one song the app tried to get me to download the whole album . now i am trying to figure out how to get a refund . love the song but the technology could be better .
1	if you like blue and you like rock , this is your ticket . not only can joe play some awesome guitar , he is also got a great voice to go along with it . i just now discovered joe and am in love with his music ( my wife is too ) . great guitar , great singing , great beat , great band . what more can you ask for ? if his other work is a good a this , then i will end up owning every cd he ha . seriously , if you do not like this cd and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor .
1	the title say it all , really . i absolutely adore this song . listen to it on you tube and then you will want to buy it too !
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly . vocal are smooth and hypnotic . overall a great album .
1	beautiful love song . beautiful voice . i became a johnny hartman fan a a result of hearing this song .
1	david broza is an amazing talent . loved seeing him live and wa thrilled to purchase this cd .
0	gift
0	disappointing
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music . what happened to free ?
0	though , i will take some responsibility . i downloaded from itunes & should/could have listened to the sample . my bad . how can they use the same name a an already existing band ? and produce music like this while using that name ? really , it should be an outrage . i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for . oh well . i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness . hopefully it will not come up in random very often .
1	what can i say , a massively favorite song . to get the favorite recording of this i had to purchase instead of use amazon prime streaming , but . it lead my mellowing out playlist . it also is that song from the famous volvo split commercial .
0	this is a rather strange compilation . the individual track have little in common , other than that they were made for movie . this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal . it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music . the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track . this mixed bag ha very little going for it . it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner . it would have been far better a a collection of music from early film or of more recent film . a it is , it is a hodge podge that i really can not recommend to anyone .
0	i did not like this version of this song , but since this wa free , i guess i should not complain .
0	im not sure if i like it or not - i finally listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following 5 song : trust in you , enough , empty me , i wait for the lord and revive me . not even the chainsmokers . weird . the cd case and the artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers : bouquet . none of the music is chainsmokers . again weird !
0	lousy choice of song
0	seriously ? no wonder black people laugh at u . i think it is time white people ( and all musician for that matter ) start bringing actual musician ( for the generation who may not know what that is , it is people with rhythm and who pick up these funny thing called instrument ) back into the recording studio . this synthesized stuff is too tacky for word . it give me elevator and walmart sense-memory . i do not even think this is good enough for a musak award .
1	passion is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music . i have been a fan of george skaroulis ever since i stumbled upon him at a greek festival some year back . if you love great relaxing piano music along the line of george winston or jim brickman , you are in for a real treat . i have never been disappointed in this artist offering . listen to the track and find out for yourself , what you have been missing . and then get passion !
0	this sounded like something that someone just threw together . i could not use any of it and none of the song were complete .
0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album . bluntly speaking , it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time , or waisters and melted on the blunted cd . if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single , then stop searching for this cd right now . this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already . if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul . i heard killing time on a community channel on cable . it wa being broadcast by a radio station . this song by itself , put me on the trail of trip hop . a journey that took me through massive attack , portished , craig armstrong , tricky , and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down . seriously disappointed with the current direction .
0	i really do not appreciate amazon not allowing u to use our reward dollar available on our credit card when we buy mp3s . i do not accrue that many reward credit on my credit card , it would be much more fair if we could use those towards mp3 purchase .
1	i have worn it out , also gave a gift to family .
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low . it not even 128bit . sound like it wa recorded on audio tape
1	good vibration .
0	not good
0	crap
1	this song wa written by todd rundgren . hall and oat are good but todd the best , i think he produced them along with patti smith ( here come the night ) and lot of other artist . most of their big hit were written by todd .
0	this is blasphemy , pure and simple . to degrade the precious holy scripture in this manner is to degrade our savior .
1	simply put . yes . very relaxing . encouraging . motivating . hope instilling . inspiring . reminds you of good thing . encouraging you to remember the creator promise
1	loved every song
1	great album !
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp3 or cd . i like the mp3 option since many cd ( album ) only contain a couple keepworthy song .
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beat are horrific probably 20 % of the album good . i do not see why people are raving about this record because it is not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lack greatness compared to other female rapper and being the face of t.i.s hustle gang she is garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack .
0	i am all for freedom of speech , but this song is just shock value . not impressed .
1	fresh worshipper leader that will help you enter into the presence of the lord .
0	i swear this is a very good parody of bob dylan singing of christmas song . it is , is not it ? please tell me it is . please .
1	the best !
1	it is a very fun song that encourages you to keep your head up and enjoy life . you will turn out fine . : )
0	there are many release of the world of nat king cole ( others with 27 to 52 song ) which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version . this is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar , you are better off skipping this one for one of the others .
0	with no doubt in my mind this is the worst unplugged album i have seen . katty perry simply is a studio artist . doe not worth to see her live singing . bad bad bad
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band . unlike most third wave ska band , they have a clear clean sound . they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal . this is not similar to early ska or the two-tone era ska . it is too peppy and energetic . this album is good clean fun . i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese . there is only one song completely in english . most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english . the only downside is that the album is only 22 minute long .
1	nice album , easy to listen to , and obviously a hit for ms. morissette . would not doubt that because of the sound , lyric and time this album wa released , itll easily be noted a a
0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said . the only place that ha the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80 cd . it sound a little thin to me but it the right version at least .
0	i never purchased it , it piggy backed on another order and claim i wanted it . besides that it awful . whiny voice , cheesy boring and silly . sound like typical office people trying to get in touch with emotion and make amoving song lol .
0	absolutely horrible pressing . save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster . i got this on a daily deal , but even at that price , it wasnt worth it . sound distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range . the bass is nonexistent , and wa quieter than most of my other record . i have listened to it about 3 time now , just to see if it needed to break in a bit . nope ! just horrible .
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released [ 1972 ] . do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo [ which i also highly recommend ] , but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and , a always with malo , there is an ensemble of latin percussion . each of the six long track provides intense listening , if you can manage to sit still that is , many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement . the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument & certainly every band member giving it their all , followed by the lively oye mama , about a latin american a you can get . somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song & i am for real say it nicely , then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat . the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive , before the final nine & a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about . if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you will not go wrong adding this one to your cd library . the musicianship is remarkable . i can not praise it enough .
0	useless
1	my niece love it !
1	love it , so upbeat , so hot !
1	this is spontaneously inspired piano music that evokes wonderful memory and stir up the dreamer in the listener ! the whole project , fingerpaintings : serenity is like peace on a disc !
1	got this song in my head after watching true detective on tv , so i had to buy it !
1	nice
1	my new favorite song .
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
1	good 1st lp . each song is good and it is quite enjoyable .
0	downloaded this thinking it wa something else . not my style of music at all . be sure to preview before purchasing .
0	not a expected . thought the music would be calming , but it ha so many short piece it wa not enjoyable for me .
1	it is weird and kinda creepy , but i love it .
1	when two super talent like keith urban and miranda lambert get together , it is bound to be a hit and this one certainly is ! i would rate this among the great duet in country music . highly recommended !
1	this is nice song from my day of growing up in the 70 and still is a good song .
0	thought i wa downloading the original version . very disappointed .
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july 31 , 1964 at age 39 , his legion of fan simply refused to let go . from that point to 1984 no le than 34 of his rca single release would make the country chart , seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot 100. not even the late , great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour . i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef . to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had 80 country hit single between 1953 and 1984 , 27 of which crossed over to the hot 100 , six to the adult contemporary chart ( which did not begin until 1961 ) , and one to the r & b chart . never mind the hundred of equally-wonderful selection from his many eps and lp . all in all , however , i would say he did a fairly credible job , augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and three more photo of jim , including one with wife mary at an award ceremony . a partial discography of the content is also included , but without any chart detail . all but track 20 [ recorded in 1958 and included on an early lp ] were hit for jim , 18 of them pop crossover [ only track 4 made only the country list , going to # 2 early in 1959 ] . his version of the old standard , i love you because , wa recorded in 1962 and wa first released on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and , in 1976 , became a # 54 country hit a a single . note , too , that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in 1960 and released on rca victor 7800 , going to # 8 country/ # 31 hot 100 a the flipside of i missed me [ # 3 country/ # 44 hot 100 and not included here ] , the first version , done in 1957 [ # 3 country ] , remains a bit difficult to find . the earliest hit represented here , and the one that lead off the disc , is four wall [ # 1 country for eight week in 1957 ] which wa his initial pop crossover [ # 11 ] . however , this came after 13 country hit beginning in 1953 with mexican joe [ # 1 for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o ranch boy ] . so i tend to agree with another reviewer who say that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd . not counting the first six , five of which were for the abbott label and one , i love you , a # 3 duet with ginny wright on the fabor label , there were seven rca cut to choose from . the best of these included the afore-mentioned am i losing you , a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart , both # 4 . still , it is hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum 5 star .
1	great group !
0	the music is well layed out and engineered extremely well but the lyric make me want to slap this guy for being a whining as . his voice bore the crap out of me .
1	it wa amazing !
1	i absolutely love this song . they sound awesome together . being a woman with a busy job and a husband with the same this song make complete sense to me .
1	fun song
1	love it !
0	they play this song so many time when this came out and gosh will he ever go away ? he is overrated and need to work at mcdonalds cause no one lovin it .
1	gorgeous music that go through your soul !
1	shinedown being shinedown at their best ! similar yet very different from all their other offering ! keep it up gentleman !
1	first came out in 1980 , a this wa the band second lp . maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that . this garden of delight pressing ha an added bonus song . tune i liked best were the title track back on my hill , stick in your eye and the seventeen-minute judgement day . faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original member - heinz mikus - guitar & vocal and horst stabenow - bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change - they released several more effort - rock lion ( 81 ) , hard breath ( 83 ) and gold n glory ( 84 ) . check em out .
0	wa not aware that they were not the original track
0	not worth the wait or the money . if i want some foreigner to preach to me about politics and the state of the world i will turn on the any of the left owned television station or read the slanted truth on the internet . i will be throwing mine in the trash could not sit though 3 song . please stop shoving you political view down our throat and start to entertain with some great music .
0	where is the banjo ? where is the awesome make me live music ? there is not one song on this album that compare to anything or any one song you have done in the past . whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong . do what you love , not what other people want . this is definitely not what i expected . i just got this today , on your release day and could not skip through it fast enough . very disappointed .
1	mint condition is an excellent group . they sing song that touch your heart and that you can let your parent or others listen to . the music is wholesome and meaningful .
0	when i first played this cd , i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez . then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following : all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group . not sure what this is supposed to mean , but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to . do not waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else .
0	when i purchased this product it would not download . i could get no help from amazon . it wasnt worth pursuing it for 99 cent .
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw . only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal . ( i love to hear her sing . ) if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice , you will be left wanting more . while i applaud the idea of trying something new , it did not work here . the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal . it is just that simple .
0	i must have ordered this by mistake because i do not remember it . wa i supposed to download it or what ? i would like my money back please
0	did not download . pissed
1	love it
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 2 other cd this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review , so it is going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give 5 * to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory . i also presume , therefore , that any review that are not favourable will come with a 2/17 people found this review of use attached . all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd , are not a self-confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year , and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service - take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it . the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan , not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in . you may enjoy it , but i would try before you buy first . my own personal thought - i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i do not view this a a foster v rubin thing , so this is not a hankering for a return to the older style recording . in fact , i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction . he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this , a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often . however , i do not feel that he is done that . and yet , at the same time , i think he is charged off in many different direction . i just do not know what to make of this album , even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when i would rather have left it alone . i am aware that some album require work to grow on you , hence i wanted to give it a chance , but this is not happening . sadly it is the opposite effect and every time i listen , there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and can not face listening to some of the track . the nick cave cover ? massive orchestral arrangement . an italian song ? massive orchestral arrangement . london hymn ? i am expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock . interspersed with song that are , i presume , the stripped-down sound groban wa hoping to achieve . to me , it just doe not flow or have any coherence a an album . i just feel that it is trying to be so many different thing , and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark . i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a ; i honestly believe that groban , judging from awakes february song , can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here . some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are , i probably can guess , even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan . having said that , i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically - even if it sometimes miss the mark . i can not face giving this one star , because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary . but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd - like another reviewer , i can not cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic . sadly it is staying in the packaging , to be gifted to someone that i am probably not that close to . edited to add - i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album . my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board , [ . ] , entitled be sure to leave a 4 or 5 star review on amazon.com . the cd could use them . i merely think that people who are not fan , and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them , should hear a balance of opinion . jg fan have ( rightly or wrongly ) a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him , and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album , many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music - that thread wa sent a a link to many fan , and a such it could have an impact on here . i think it is only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves .
0	well if this is the best massive attack album , then i will not be buying any more . nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop imo . this is way overrated ! i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day , yet i listened to and loved portishead , hooverphonic , morcheeba , sneaker pimp becoming x , etc . there are a few good track , but for the most part , it is a mish-mash . maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length . repetitive running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster-speak get dull fast . ya know , getting a few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doe not make a good record .
1	wonderful cd ! one of brandis best . highlight are the eye and wherever is your heart
1	a great classic from curtis mayfield . grew up listening to his musical creation and have always been in awe . fantastic
1	digital download wa smooth .
1	i use to hear that song without knowing the title . i finally found it and i am enjoying it . thanks to amazon for making purchase so easy and good quality music .
0	should have been edited version it seemed what i wa purchasing great artist loved blurred line without the ugliness , make sure purchaser know what there buying , i gave it away
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable . his second album wa the best - he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song . the material is weak and the lyric are laughable . this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star . he wa never that - his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word . his interpretation of classic on american idol ( mad world , track of my tear ) , made the song his own . he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury ( vocally , even though he could not match his stage presence or personality ) . i guess his first two cd did not sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder - so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber . we do not need another shallow electronica/pop/disco clone ! good luck adam - i think you have lost the majority of your fan base . you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad .
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled banner
1	this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric , interesting production and musicianship . it blur the genre of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence . for fan of progressive , emotional and electronic music , this is album is for you . check adam . 01 at [ . ]
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such little imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the music world history . . and that they do it so very badly . band like the people , touch , white witch , armageddon , ( and the list go on and on ) were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds . and yet , modern band continue to take those name for themseles , then release inferior , common , boring music , and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the name of others . pathetic !
0	not really chistmas-y , just 12 1/2 minute of repetitive and tedious listening . thankfully , it wa free , otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
1	what else can i say ? another great album by a great artist . like another review it different than his last album but just a good all the same . i highly recommend this album .
0	the problem with getting the preview is that they never let you hear the end of song . i do not know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album , but several of the song have the last note or two cut off , either completely or right in the middle of a note . not a lot of joy there . i will say that there are some song on the album that are fine , but getting slammed like that really ruin everything . i will probably go through the album again and remove these song from my device .
1	good song
0	horrible . do not buy it . i would rather suck puke through a straw . this is the worst song i have ever heard . yuk .
1	great song !
0	far too cloying . the original fleetwood mac version wa sweet without being cloying and is far , far superior . unfortunately , that version is not available a a legal mp3 download . i am left with the option of buying the cd of bare tree for this song .
0	music is great-it will not download to my phone ! ?
1	phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio , jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum , along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga , and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans . all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well . jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd . it command premium $ in the collector market , and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician . i remember when i had the 8-track ( ! ) of this back in the 70 that i played to death - still have a mint condition vinyl copy ( and cover ) that i guard with my life . if it doe not come out on cd soon , i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format , which i have done with many out-of-print vinyl album still unavailable on cd . this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it . the writing , arranging , and playing on jamal play jamal is superb , with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horn and string by evans . two of the piece , pasture and death & resurrection , are particularly sub- lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra . eclipse , dialogue , and spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill , a well . my favorite piece on the album , swahililand , is also the longest at almost ten minute and is an extended , magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horn and string before he kick in with the main section on fender rhodes . weston is astounding on conga al- ternating from left channel to right . jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the tour-de-force . it is the final track on the album and close it out in fine fashion - extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved . the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing , arranging , and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and paul serrano . i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the year and dearly love his early impulse work , but jamal play jamal is my favorite of his . a stellar work of art that , once again , is long overdue for cd release . another desert island disc . p.s . had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover . sound better than ever !
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r & b , you are in for some rare treasure . this is not one of those kind of cd . the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded , poorly performed , and lacking in appealing hook . this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost .
0	i think this is her worst song ever . blah ! she is so talented , i can not fathom why she would write such an incipid song a this .
1	excellent !
0	acck ! michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw . run and hide ! it sound like . sorta like weird whistling . if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o.k album . i rated it 1 star because there wa no -200 star . : ( . all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible . i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad . if you are wondering , this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent . the one we paid for were very good though . i guess i found out the purpose of free cd .
0	i hate not having a portable mp # file . i either own the music or i do not ? i do not listen to these tune on my computer !
1	the long awaited debut album from stalley doe not disappoint . trunk rattling bass , ode to old school and midwest pimping at it best !
0	did not order this item
0	never heard this version before ! would have been nice to have been nice if l had been made aware that there wa various artist . this is not even the guy who wrote the song ( cohn ? or cohen ? ) even though llove the song l had to delete this version immediately ! waste of money
1	good
1	how can your toe not tap to this one . mar knock it out of the stratosphere again .
1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
0	it is an okay song , but the whole reason i downloaded it , wa i wa looking for a kelli glover song . maybe she is in the background , but not worth the $ .99 . sorry folk . i wish kelli would put up a website and let u download some song of hers . she can sing .
0	it is a typical contemporary song . it make a great high school reunion song . for me it is john mayer debut song . you will know what all this time wa for , indicates his confidence in his song .
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past 30 year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album . like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy . these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist ( robert lamm , terry kath , and peter cetera ) however , a most fan know , the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty . so , one might ask , what wa i expecting ? for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow . although i am sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement , he did not contribute a single song . robert contributed very little , too . if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live , you will agree that this band still ha it . i have to wonder what they have been doing 9from a compositional standpoint ) for the last 15 year ? robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion ( s & p ) is an excellent effort . and in many way it seems more chicago than xxx . why could not robert have saved some of his material ( i.e . somewhere girl ) for this new release ? instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad - which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did . there are some funky mix here , but what are they ? they sure do not seem too chicago . and then there are the horn . everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction . while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s & p , on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought - forced and contrived . also , the cheesy 80 percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem , a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did , they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single . these guy are talented musician . they do not need to prove themslelves to anybody . where is their integrity ? simply put , i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity .
0	too expensive

1	love their music
0	i listened to the sample of this recording and wa struck by how overwrought and melodramatic ms. crowe had made her interpretation . i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss . mr. cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship , mr. buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again . both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection . ms. voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over . like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just , nor is she willing to curse god and die .
1	awesome product i like it !
1	great tune !
0	in general i dislike live recording , for two reason . in an actual concert , audience are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day . no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control - a if that wa the artist last word on the music . this is grossly unfair , and review rarely acknowledge the difference , but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work . let me put it this way : if i audition a work and read the score , i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise , dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing , and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine . so my purpose is defeated . it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion , an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home , when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time . exceptio probat regulam ! it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance . call it lucky , if you will , but such recording exist . the album under review is one such . moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio , and it come off the better . schubert no . 9 ( or 7 or 8 , depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force ) wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue . it ha several defect : ( 1 ) the sound is boxy and dull , painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra . ( 2 ) davis play all the repeat in every movement . for a studio reading , this is idiotic , since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant , without adding anything other than the same music again . ( 3 ) the performance is routine all the way through , davis having one of his most uninspired day . all 3 point conduce to an unutterably boring account , saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra . another time , h & auml ; nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance . on that day , davis produced something entirely different . he wa alive and alert , judged tempo judiciously and ( i suspect ) played to the audience instead of the microphone . moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense . event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated , but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all ( mvmts 1 , 4 ) , melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time ( mvmts 3 , 4 ) , and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts 1 and 4 is not sacrificed to academic criterion , but to a situation of living music making . even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording . the question remains in the end where to place these recording . but i think i have answered that question implicitly . the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived , but well played recording - e.g . in the vicinity of muti , karajan , ormandy , steinberg ( boston ) et al . the live recording move up a considerable number of slot . it is not top class , a defined by the classic recording of krips , b & ouml ; hm and wand ( berlin ) , but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt ( dresden ) , bernstein ( concertgebouw ) , giulini ( chicago ) , tennstedt and solti . an honourable place , even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking . ( p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording ) .
0	0304 see jewel cross-over from her folk-country root to pop . laced with heavy beat and keyboard , this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense . whereas , jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling , this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her . her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener . i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me . a disappointing affair overall . i think that she will look back on this one with regret .
0	not exactly what i wanted but it ok. wow they require twelve mote word before i can leave this review .
1	i love anything royalty free . this album ha everything in 30 sec , 60 sec , and full track . these track range from movie track to high energy rock . with this album you get over 50 track . i will use this high quality music and in my independent film project .
1	great song
1	excellent song
0	i wa told this wa happy music . i find it boring & depressing . i am tossing it .
1	dancing music from flo rida . ha song lyric right round taken from an older song . so if you liek the older song , this one ha a modern twist , hip hop .
0	this is by far the worst christmas album i have ever heard . sound like he wa drunk when he recorded this . even if someone gave this to me i would not want this in my collection .
0	it wa a cassette useless .
0	i am not sure when this cd wa released but it certainly is doe not contain the original version . in fact , i am not even sure it is really buck fizz ( it is that bad. ) . if you have never heard anything by them before , do not buy this cd . if you have heard them before , do not buy this cd . ick .
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
1	a star is born !
1	great song i am not that much into country but might be changing , ( not all the way , but will checking out ) love the song
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
1	i love this song and group ! it brings back memory of my youth . thanks for having this song for me to purchase .
1	if this wa all you got for prime it would be worth it . amazon , i love you !
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback . robin thicke , pharrell and t.i . definitly hit the nail on the head with one . it reminded me of something you would hear from earth , wind and fire . i hope these three collaborate again .
1	absolutely love it . one of my favorite song at the moment .
1	great song i have always love that song
0	this product did not download properly . a a result i had to download a second time - incurring a second charge ! i wa robbed !
1	nice cd
1	this song is one of those song that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self .
1	he is sings about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved his m music . i love this cd !
1	excellent single to celebrate the 51th anniversary of the artist that ha been in the top of the chart for the last 25 year . this single keep you moving unless you are dead and did not know it . lol excellent !
1	if you have watched the tv show , then you already know how catchy the song are . the only difference between tv and the cd , is probably length . i have not actually verified this , but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer , and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show ? either way , a good time with good music .
0	this is his worse album every . the lyric suck and his beat suck . he claim to be the best but he is not . the worse song are theee forth of the disk . he should have took time and dud this disk right
0	bwb is a great collaboration , but this album dropped the ball . every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any genre . the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work . i am not sure what intent for that wa , but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through , not this .
0	. which is not saying much since i got this a a freebie ! since this wa free , i decided to download it for kick . sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse a the song progressed . while his diction wa good ( hence , the extra -star rating ) , it still did not make up for his breathy voice or his pitchiness ( going either sharp or flat - usually flat ) - and i still have no real idea what the song wa all about ! actually , i am rather glad i got this a a free download . at least i will know not to waste my money on the entire album !
0	song were different from what i heard on youtube
1	great album !
0	be warned she went creative # pose # 7 # iscreative . i first had 4 star but went to two lol
1	his voice is tempered with gravel , but the word are still magic . the album only get better with a few listening . he ha been missed , and this may be one of his last work , but it wa worth the wait .
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r & b music . scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam . tank music in the past ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd . the great thing is he did not try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound , he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate . for the lady . tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u ! lol !
0	the album is great so do not think the star are for that . it get lower star rating because it is censored . the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this . when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [ explicit ] but one that is clean ha nothing like [ censored ] or [ clean ] next to it . jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it . i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people do not get screwed over . i know i am not the only one who had this problem and this is not the only album for which this is a issue . again great album but buy the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download .
0	love the cd but no booklet .
1	for what it is , it is a great tune sung by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic . brilliant !
0	not a favorite . i prefer a more celtic sounding version of this song . i wa disappointed in this version . sorry .
1	wow ! these guy just get better and better and they work together so very well beautiful irish sound sing on
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version . definitely not disappointed with this pressing , first off it is heavy , it feel even heavier than 180 gram . the mastering also seems pretty good , drum are tight and high are bright , the saxophone especially shine . the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone . my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp , they were not . this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side , which really minimizes inner-groove distortion . on my setup the last song louder than word ( the only with vocal ) there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment . a far a the actual music , i have only listened through it once so far , spoiler alert : the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about 2/3rds of the way through . the energy throughout is very calm and soothing , there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse , this is more like obscured by cloud . there is really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio , and that is because it is one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole , it is really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album . overall it is nothing spectacular , but it is a well put together album and very easy on the ear , a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day . a must have for any big floyd fan or collector . i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening .
1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past 30 year than dokken . even without george , without jeff , and a weakened ( and at time embarrassing ) don , this band is still one-of-a-kind . no matter the lineup , dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release . jon levin is incredible . never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george . the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay . levin is that good . the first and last 3 song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the 5 tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable . don vox are not a strained a on lightning strike again - he seems to have found a register where he can still sound smooth . ( of course , mark boals in the background doe not hurt but cheating is allowed at this age ) keep it going , don - we are still out there .
1	my favorite version of the ave maria ! i particularly like that there is not a lot of vibrato . so happy amazon ha this !
0	you will love it if you like transsexual rapping .
0	i wa hoping for something better than this . i have been reading all the rave review and wondering if amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest . my first impression wa , sale of the 7 string must be down . time to over use it again . i love , love , love vai . i do not love story of light . i can not even give a coherent explanation why at this point . i made it through the first listen and wa thankful that i only spent the money on the download . his tone is brilliant , his playing is still out of this world . i have loved him and his quirky composing since flex able . this one is a miss . though there are some high point , they quickly come down and stay there most of the time . i will not waste our time giving you a song by song review . buy it and judge for yourself .
0	i wa a huge fan of dm album like music for the mass , black celebration , and violator . i also enjoyed people are people , some song on broken frame and much of speak and spell . but , most of this record never did anything for me . it is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80 that i did not really try to like from band i liked . but , a few song like lie to me are good a i recall , but people are people is a stronger early mode post speak and spell choice . stick with music for the mass , violator , black celebration , people are people , and speak and spell .
1	the presentation of this well-know musical piece is superbly performed by the london philharmonic orchestra . if you have not listened to it in a while , i strongly suggest that you revisit it . you will not be disappointed .
1	it is classic michael jackson ! how can you be anything le than thrilled at thriller ! it is just a great album at a great price ! it is time le and you can not go wrong with adding this little gem to your collection !
1	such a beautiful track . i come back and listen to this at least once a month .
0	sad sad album ! a an old fan of marilyn mccoo i jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release . to my deception ! the album is a collection of old hit produced like it wa recorded in a lobby of a 2 star hotel ! they both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though marilyn mccoo still keep her perfect and crystal clear english . the highlight of this album is her reedition of bacharahs this girl in love with you . there are two extra dowloadable song that only god know how it work to get it ! if you are a fan of hers you will still get it but do not expect it to be what it used to be ! i had it because i am still faithfull !
0	horrible . i only bought it because the ex-girlfriend wanted it . i wish there wa a no star rating .
1	love it !
1	i really liked this album when it first came out . one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch . do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor . it is hard to explain . each song can hold it is own . even though david soul is best known a an actor/director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one . i do not believe you will be disappointed with this selection .
0	the song are great , but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back . it it a static-filled , compressed mess and it is pretty hard to listen to . whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album . waiting for the remaster .
0	i wanted pg version , the one i bought had too much cussing in it
0	i am a vocal man , so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music , why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean , during my era of music it wa pretty simple . journey . lovin , touchin , squeezin , pretty simple huh . def leppard . pour some sugar on me , no college class to figure out what any of those song were about ! and i guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now .
0	sound quality is poor - probably original . it would be better if the track had been remastered . at least you get to hear the way the music sounded by the original band at the time they were produced .
0	. some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because , foolishly like me , you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago , but you get to listen to the composition of : 1- dannay orton , 2- blair daly , 3- greg barnbill , 4- dennis matkosky , 5- chas sandford , 6- jay demarcus , 7- brett james , 8- george hawkins jr. , 9- marcus hummon , who are not in the band . with only 1 song ( out of 12 ) written entirely by a band member , apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so . if you , foolishly like me , buy this album to hear the band play , you have to listen to : 1- lee thornberg : trumpet , 2- james matchack : keyboard , 3- jay demarcus : keyboard , 4- tom bukovac : guitar , 5- dan huff : guitar , 6- dean deleo : guitar , 7- yankton mingua : guitar , 8- jack kincade : guitar , 9- jay demarcus : guitar . 10- steve brewster : drum , 11- john brockman : drum , and listen to the vocal of : 12- shelly fairchild , 13- rascal flatts , 14- gary levox , 15- jay demarcus , 16- joe don roony , 17- bobby kimball 18- joseph williams ; so in the eye of mr jay demarcus , the producer of this album , allegedly by chicago , 16 additional musician and 9 song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were , in his eye , incapable of doing ! jay demarcus himself ha played guitar , and key , a well a treating u to some singing . i am glad he had some fun , but i wa not paying to hear him and his other 15 friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago . if i had wanted to listen to all those other 25 people i would have asked for their name in the shop , not ask for chicago . is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a ` chicago cd ? i am not referring to the quality of music here , which is purely a matter of personal taste but , good or bad , i wanted to listen to chicago . i do not mind if i do not like the song , a long a it is their music . but apparently , in the eye of the producer and financier of this album , there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music ; only a name to milk . a they did with chicago 19 and 21 , but far worse this time . i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it ; i do however mean to offend that faithless producer , jay demarcus , who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision , and ha offended the band by showing clearly that , a their producer , he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves . his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable : 6 guest guitarist ? he ha not let keith play on at least 9 of the song ! and he ha not let tris play drum on 4 of the song ! this is a joke . not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy ! he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of others . if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album . but the band themselves , whom i had continued to love for decade , should have known better , after a thinking pause of 15 year , what to choose to go out on , and what legacy and memory to leave behind ; cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this . a bunch of the usual type ballad , indistinguishable from any out-takes from any of the album from 16 to 21 , written and performed in great part by others , is an unworthy epitaph , for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under . conclusion : 1- if you are a fan of the chicago 1 to 7 , entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning . 2- if you are a fan of the chicago 8 to 11 , you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy , such a the one by robert . borrow it from a friend for a listen . 3- if you are a fan of the chicago 12 to 17 , you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much . worth buying for occasional listening . 4- if you are a fan of chicago 18 to 21 , you are not going to care who made the song and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album , which is more of the same . it ha some good playing by some people , just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album , and good production . buy it and love it .
1	jessye norman ha a voice that is rich a the most elegant satin . i have purchased quite a few of her piece , why ? because thanks to amazon music , i can pick and choose and download the one i want . i have now loaded many of her spiritual , both solo and with kathleen battle , onto both the computer and my mp3 player , to enjoy whenever i choose . her singing is grand , the selecton is wonderful , and the price is right .
0	disappointed , but never with much hope . it is a shame .
1	love her and her music !
0	hall & oates a interpreted by a 1977 casio wristwatch and a screech owl . this is the best of the first quarter of 2010 ? no star ! ( well , i guess i have to give this crap one star to get outa here . ) why only 1 blue album ?
1	i love this song . the melody and musicianship are great . i listen to this song when i lift weight and in the morning a i am getting ready for work .
1	great to listen to . for my daughter and the lesson through life . also smash mouth get knocked down but i get back up again !
0	very disappointed . the song i really want it are not on here . but it is still a good cd . if i had known my song were not here i would not have purchased it .
0	the beat is choppy over typical 80 rythym . you get the feeling of a james bond film . i think i did hear it @ the beginning of a james bond film . i always thought duran duran wa from england .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism , the animal third album , the first beeing the animal and the second animal track , i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job i have heard so far . the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track . a complete failure ! repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try- thank god i have the original on tape - in stereo !
1	love this song !
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship . their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum . i have bought the album only for their edgy rock sound . with this new album , the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing . they have gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring 4-on-the-floor drum pattern . it sound more like what you would hear in a disco . very disappointing . i will not buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take . for an example of the shallow lyric , here is the verse & chorus to the title track , limitless : i am saying goodbye to any limitation . i am saying hello to the god of all creation . there are no limit with you . there are no limit with you . you are limitless , nothing too hard for you . you are limitless , there is nothing you can not do . you are bigger , and you are greater and you are stronger i know . you are limitless , you are limitless . and that is it . sing the verse twice and the chorus 5 or 6 time .
0	those that have followed grace and the noc , this is a disappointment . grace is much to talented a songwriter for this . this is an artist like picaso doing a paint by number . if you liked never going back v song with meaning like apology or big white gate , this is for you . gone are song with meaning , soul , truth , blue , replaced by techno . i ms the guitar riff between scott and benny . i miss a piano solo like star . i miss a rocker like ah mary or stop the bus . the influence of neil young , zep , steve miller , stone , and janis are replaced by pop singer . yes every artist ha the choice to pursue and grow . every fan ha the choice to buy . my prediction will be a nocturnals reunion in the near future . i waited week to post a review to give it a chance to grow . it ha not .
0	i have bought music through amazon preferring them to itunes because because itunes try to control their music too much . however after the latest mp3 purchase , i find it now amazon ha made it a difficult a possible to download their music to my itunes . bye-bye amazon . i guess i am gon na have to go back to the itunes store a much a i hate to .
1	this is absolutely beautiful - especially by harp music .
1	relaxing
0	got for a friend to hear kid sound creepy
1	best alternative/pop-rock album of the last time . best parallel project by matt berninger of the national , and brent knopf of menomena .
1	el-p continues to impress . each of his album is very good , but they all build on the brilliance of the previous release . a true artist in every sense . really good album ! get it if you are remotely into rap/hip hop music in any way .
0	i bought this for my 8 month old and she is not impressed by it at all . she much rather listens to the radio . guess i could have saved the money
0	while the arrangement of this cover get 5 star , this performance of it get 1 ( it would get 0 if that were an option ) . if you want to hear the original cover , which wa done while giving proper credit where it wa due , check out jonathan coulton ! also , purchase the one that is in the style of glee so that the purchase go to a good cause . < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/baby-got-back-in-the-style-of-glee/dp/b00b6lrx34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > baby got back ( in the style of glee ) < /a >
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure [ to the mass ] songwriter . turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one . and come on , taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest ? who advised you ?
0	so i know there are two dirty word in the song and i wanted the clean version ( that you hear on the radio ) so i could listen to it even if my child pop into the room . but instead of using another word like the radio edit . this one us cartoon effect . very weird and just a you are getting into the song that pop up . wish i wouldnt have bought this one .
0	misleading name- the name of this song should be changed . putting ( basement tape ) on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version . a real disappointment when looking for the popular version .
1	one of my favorite song
1	very sexy cool
1	another solid release ! this cd fit in well with the rest of the music ty ha put out over the year .

1	case wa cracked .
0	i would rate this cd a just ok. for the money there are better sounding version out there . this ha the uk mix which sound flat and lifeless . it ha 4 bonus track , ironically from the u lp , which are already on the album . a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like - i will get you & baby it is you . i give it 2 star out of a possible 5 .
1	love this song !
1	this is a very pleasant disc to listen to . excellent arrangement of many standard , each with an excellent combination of voice . well worhgt adding to your collection .
0	i am a huge matisyahu follower , and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like . i will keep it simple , this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream . i like the song sunshine a lot , but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect . it is pretty depressing i am writing this review right now .
0	i am not a fan of the vocal being redone . i liked the original much more . listen before you buy !
1	i had a favorite album back in high school entitled the rock album . can not seem to locate it anywhere . but here , on amazon , i can piece the album together using itunes ! voila !
1	praise god , another sweet jam from lecrae !

0	please update it to the new national anthem that libya ha now . a after the liberating libya from qaddafi this anthem ha changed
1	welcome back missy !
1	fantastic !
1	uplifting song .
0	i so much wanted to love this album ; dylan a sinatra . he must really believe that he doe not sound bad , but it wa painful to listen to the off key croaking . i love dylan and i have been a fan of frank for a long time . the longing and emotion were somewhat evident , but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much . i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i can drive along the ocean with my window open .
1	if you are an adopted child who feel that empty space in your heart or someone who want to understand then listen to this song .
1	wonderful tune and lyric .
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer . i have no idea what happened but this a well a many others wa never downloaded and i didnt want to do it again and pay more money for somehing i already paid for .
1	beautiful
1	love it !
1	i first heard this on pandora so i quickly looked it up on amazon and purchased it . this is a great acoustic version of iron bar by stephen marley !
0	according to frontman/songwriter ra mcguire , the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well-deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp . this wa after the label had voiced it approval , including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit . tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper . lawsuit were filed , friendship were scuttled , and , most significantly , they went with a different producer ( howard steele of heart fame ) . what that mean to the listener is that the man who for 4-5 year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output ( and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist/songwriters in the business ) wa now out the door , to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion . so what doe the first non-rb produced trooper album sound like ? well , aside from the reasonably solid opener ( which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever heard back when it wa a hit , and one of my favorite by the band ) , we get a weakly performed kink cover ( compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time ) , some cheesy ballad , mixed with some filler , not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is . production credit indeed . that this album wa one of their best-sellers speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product . after this one came out , they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time , a subsequent sale will attest . to add insult to injury , they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract ( 3 full album ) . sheesh . talk about a pyrrhic victory . although by 1990s ten , they had started to kick some as again , this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor ( who doe not necessarily take any more credit for their 70 success than ra songwriting . but , sometimes it is what a producer _will not_ let the artist do that is just a important , ya know ?
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artist and album . i do not know how to account for that . it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like , unlike in time past . i received this album a a gift . this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music- soul , r & b , rock . folk etc . like ccr in the late 60 they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention . this group also grab your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar- which is unusual , to be frank . this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric , but unlike ccr this album is tuneless . in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen- i have listened to it twice . not sure if i can do it one more time , but i will , because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me . i really want to like this group , but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head . i will come back to update this review if it grows on me .
1	great album
1	help is another great album recorded by the beatles . few other artist had their rate of consistency . song like help , the night before , ticket to ride , and tell me what you see are true true rock song . act naturally is almost country . you have got to hide your love away , it is only love and i have just seen a face are very much like folk song . yesterday and i need you are classic ballad . no le essential than any of the other beatles album . buy it .
0	do not appreciate any nudity openly on amazon
1	great song
0	this make no sense . note to god is not an original song from charice . the song is from jojos album the highroad that came out in 2006. for charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know it not make no sense . i am a very big fan of jojo but not so much of charice anymore .
1	i love this song , waiting for more from oaktowns 3-5-7. this song pump me up everttime . let do it my friend
1	an excellent song ( and prayer ) for every believer ! help me to keep my focus on my heavenly hope . i think most of u long for our heavenly home and to be with our loved one that have gone before u .
0	not what i wa looking for- i wanted a reading of the sanskrit , the word for word definition and the translation . the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature , so the 3 star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking . also , i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires . the sanskrit mantra , when they are present and accurately read , are music enough .
1	wonderful contemporary arrangement by gary bonner of these wonderful old standby hymn !
1	another stellar album from the awesome jenny ! beautiful and finely crafter all the way through !
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan ? fan do . this collection of song span his early career with all the best music . gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter . never one for ballad , his music is quite original and thought provoking . this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad . i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit . since 1999 gowan is still performing . now with the band styx . never-the-less it is his early year i remember with fondness . this album is the best of gowan .
0	do not waste your time
1	i love these song !
0	so why are you asking me to review it ? this is a stupid automated review process controlled by software clearly written by some idiot programmer . stop pestering your customer to work for you without compensation by writing review !
0	i never seen so many of her video ( like die young ) that ha nothing but anti-christ and illuminati symbolism in them . i thought lady ga ga and mondana wa bad . if you do not catch it then your being programmed .
0	doe a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician ? i thought not , so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend . if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be-all , end-all of the music scene , it would not have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago . this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world . look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music . when you see it in it totality , his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal , and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental . most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence , but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu-metal and hate-rock to be bore from nirvana . nirvana had none of the passion , drive , and true grit that make honest musician stand out . nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it is . that is how easily-duped they are . when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix , bob dylan , and john lennon , i find it sickening because cobain , a he is been anointed by his fan and critic alike , is king of the slacker . he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit . a modern musician and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman . unlike cobain , she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted . she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had . she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied ; kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle-class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to . traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once . could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing ? no . when getting into music , i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band , nirvana , pop-punk , and any form of metal , especially for younger people getting into the music scene . if you read that and ask , what else is there to choose from , i think the you have given in to the medium already . once teen discover kurt cobain , they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so , that there is nothing beyond him , which is a lie . i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether . i recommend : tracey chapman , the cranberry , the b-52 , the beatles , john lennon , bob dylan , the moody blue , and anything else experimental or strange . nirvana wa just lazy .
0	this cd contains the censored version . when cash say the son of bitch you will hear beeeeep instead . what are we , 10 year old ? the at san quentin original version is uncensored . i am not sure what other version are uncensored , but definitely this one is . when this song is not censored , it is a 5-star song that put a smile on your face .
0	on 12.29 , i am waiting out in the colorado cold until about 2 am to see if i could get jim heath ( the reverend horton heat ) signature on a poster . first , he said , do you have a pen ? i said i did , and pulled out a blue sharpie . he next said , is it blue ? i said it wa . he proceeded to tell me he doe not do blue pen , and boarded his luxury motorhome . please do not support jim heath . jimbo and scott churilla signed the poster without hesitation , and are good guy . jimbo even took the time to take a picture with u .
0	i wa counting down the day to this album being released . i listen to sturgills first two album often and could not wait for new stuff . so i buy the album on release day and start listening . what the heck is this ? ! ? ! the 1st track is ok , the nirvana cover is absolutely putrid , the rest of the album is just boring and generic . huge disappointment !
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse . they have really grown together a a band . the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album , but they have not lost the depth . jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life , rather than dwelling on the past . the vocal are also much more powerful ; jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing . this is evident on the track anchor , wash , and spin . on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto , and on the title track , stanley climbfall , he is absolutely electric . other highlight on the record are sky is falling , am i ever gon na find out , and take me away ; however , this is one of those album where every song is great and can be listened to over and over again . there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall ! the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure . the song will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you . i highly recommend that you give this record a listen !
0	can not say that there is anything particularly memorable on this cd . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
1	k. 482 is the most visionary , musically-expressively complex , and difficult-to-bring-off of mozart piano concerto , a true concerto for wind instrument , piano and orchestra . fischer , a conductor , extract unusually well-balanced , articulate , expressive performance from this minor orchestra ( in itself a remarkable feat ) , while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work . some might question whether this is mozart-styled performance ; no , but it should be . ( i am often an admirer of period performance ; but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal - forgive the old-fashioned rhetoric . ) this review is based on another company lp issue of the same 1954 performance . fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend ; now one can imagine why .
1	excellent recording . i can not stop listening to this . once i bought this , i got all the other master in this series a well .
1	the disc came shortly after i ordered it , and ha been very impressive ever since . this young british maestro definitely ha this score well under his skin . the vienna philharmonic play splendedly , especially the lovely ending in the final movement .
0	this is not the the acapella , and it heavily distorted . amazon music fail -_-
0	i am a big fan of terry hall and the colourfields fantastic first album , virgin & philistine , but with personnel change and a different vibe , this album pale in comparison . terry voice is still great but he go in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion , which is still one of my favorite from the mid-80s .
0	some of these song are so bad they are funny . i kept bandy bandy , by zap mama featuring erykah badu , which is nice . also kept two other track , which i shall not name , but only for my really bad song playlist .
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tune over and over again everywhere you go . this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling and an upbeat tune . i enjoy listening to this over and over again . i would love to find more of these kind of new tune . new to me anyway .
0	this is another case where le is more . i found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting . instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i wa caught in a deluge .
0	not what i expected . it is kind of dreary and depressing . i love iris but not this one .
0	nice
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west , their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney , i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice . only one for kanye wa absolutely awful , and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian . rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney , four five second is absolutely very low for both of them . they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting . for rihanna , it is one of the worst song she ha came out with , and she need to really find her voice all over again , and for kanye , it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done , and lost his own voice at the same time . for rihanna fan , she need much stronger for her next work , and she wasted her own time with low gimmick . song : d
0	a disappointment compared to other beegie adair performance . i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it .
0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never came out you think a track featuring garry shider , skeet curtis , and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier .
0	i am a huge stevie fan , and this one wa rather disappointing . i actually bought 2 of these , one for me , and one for a friend of mine . the friend listened to it first and said not the best work i have heard from her , but thanks for the cd ! so on a long road trip , i played mine . boo ! so disappointed . possible 2 song at best were steve quality , the rest were rather well , boring . sorry stevie . : (
0	loved his songwriting his voice real strong excellent country music highly recommend this alum have recently bought two more album of his from amz
1	great song
0	i remember liking this song when it wa popular 5 yr ago . really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era ( and since ) . am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune ? she flat out every few bar , she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average . overall kind of meh .
1	this album is dope . wasnt really a fan of j. cole until his last album , this album will have me purchasing all of his album from now on . excellent lyric , production is outstanding . definitely one of the year best hip hop release .
1	always love josh groban . in perfect condition !
1	this is some great playing here . the tone and rhythm are perfect . this is excellent to study along with the actual 32 etude . i am giving it a 4 star because i do not like how he interprets some of the music . i know this music is difficult and there are many way to interpret it . however , some part just have to sound right
0	i do not hate the music , i bought this piece because i loved it for year , and wanted to hear it reformatted . but the recording i purchased is somehow scrambled , like different track are playing out of order in some place . not what i remembered at all ! i hope amazon can fix it .
1	it help when thing on the mind and just encourages to let go and let god handle all the problem
0	sound like he just woke up 2 second earlier . the voice is no american idol or american trash . it is worse . and a squeaky guitar string top the annoyance .
0	bought for airline flight for off line it is in the cloud and can not lisen off line
0	depression is what you will slip into when attempting to listen to this comedy album
1	good quality sound and it wa the original . enjoyed listening to this - took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio .
1	what a great song ! gwen stefani is an awesome lead singer . i have always been a fan ! this song never get old .
0	bob dylan should know better - he no longer ha a voice . moral of the story - do not get old and think you can still sing . this also applies to harry nilson , paul mccartney , etc .
1	no one play this song any better than conductor and violinist . andre rieu . i first saw him on public television and wa so appreciative of his playing and conduting style . he truly ha feeling in each note he play on his violin . i know you will enjoy his music !
0	i am disappointed in this version of the song . i can not understand the word at all . the singer are not louder than the accompaniment , so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the word , especially in a christmas carol . there is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty .
1	fascinatingly unique . lin manuel ha created something that changed music . i can not stop listening to this album because every time i listen to it , i learn more about not only the music but about race issue and history . can not recommend it highly enough
1	for someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music , it melody and lyric a well a it arrangement and performance , i find this cd one of the most beautiful recording of all-time . once again and a always , the great nelson riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standard from the great american songbook . this cd will take u to a musical journey a we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music . with the superb instrumental skill of pianist don grolnick , drummer john guerin , bassist bob magnusson , guitarist bob mann ( who also played fabulously on rod stewart and steve tyrells recording ) and the creative flair of concertmaster david frisina , this cd offer some of the glowing moment of ms. ronstadts musical career . lush life , what is new ? and for sentimental reason are three of the greatest and most beautiful album of standard ever recorded . nobody sounded more expressive than ms. ronstadt singing when i fall in love , a song lamenting that love ha ended even before it ha begun . you can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist , bob mann , complementing ms. ronstadts exquisite voice . likewise , nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of when your lover ha gone . what lonely hour the evening shadow bring what lonely hour with memory lingering like faded flower life can not mean anything . . . in skylark , the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition a she brings new life to this johnny mercer/hoagy carmichael classic . she also left a lasting impression to one of sinatra signature song i am a fool to want you , just like ol blue eye did with his meaningful interpretation . they both did the best version for male and female vocal , respectively . she swing lightly on rodgers & hart gem you took advantage of me , then she take it slower in mills/parish/ellingtons sophisticated lady . and pick up the light swing tempo again on can not we be friend ? sophisticated lady i know you miss the love you had long ago and when nobody is nigh you cry . . . you cry . if you are a lover of standard like me and an admirer of beauty in all it form , you should have this cd in your collection and take pleasure in listening to it endless beauty . here is to the magic of beautiful music !
1	jeff williams second outing a composer for rwby is a home run . he creates wonderful music that get your blood pumping and your head bobbing . personal favorite track are shine and caffeine , but they are all great track that is just a awesome a rwby itself .
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit , you will sell more record . i really do not know where to start with this one . this band rip off every band from u2 to green day to the killer , and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy , with the exception of one pop-punk track , time to say goodbye . it wa said that during the three-plus year that passed between album , that the group singer/songriter ryan bouvier had writer block . this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song , making simple plan sound like a boy band . even when they try to rock out , the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place . and there are way too many piano-ballads . i think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two album , which were decent effort packed with pop-punk hook , can permanently be removed now . simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three-plus year layoff between album or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career . and the answer is neither . it is the lack of originality , energy , and songcraft that will do them in . let face it , when hilary duff rock harder than you , your band is not punk . and in the three and a half year this band wa away , the scene changed , but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory . perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it . this one is headed to a bargain bin near you , right next to all those old lfo album .
1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented . a breath of fresh air !
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on , i cringe and die a little inside . it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time . aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 line of lyric with no substance , they borrow the can-can song and make it even more irritating .
1	this band ha a great sound & this is a very unique , fun christmas song . love the stringed instrument & old big band feel .
0	wow , talk about zero originality ! what do you do when you can not come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental~ what else !
1	great !
0	this artist leaf a lot to be desired . i actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind . but i found myself not being able to get past the first thirty second . it is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly pass for music today . save your money or get it on bootleg . personally i would not take this for free . add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thief , cop killer , drug addict and ex con . not the kind of person for me . natali , if you are reading this , i hope you make some better choice in the future .
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project , i have to admit , i wa excited to get my hand on this box set , from one of my fav . band . i could not even get through 12 song before i realized , what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is . david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd , to sell this garbage , and will probably do well with their past image . i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc . the two song done on the dvd disc , ( which i have not watched yet ) might be the only good thing about this disc collection . the booklet is kind of ok , but even that is not worth the price you pay . if you feel you must have this , i suggest you wait a couple of year , and you can get a used copy ( only played once ) for very cheap . in fact , you can have mine for 3 dollar . lol
0	wrong cd in case . case cracked . high price .
1	i always have . first heard it when it came out . this time i bought it s a gift for someone else .
1	song wa super . the amazon player is a total pain in the neck . i had problem playing the song with my usual mp3 and wmp program and i just do not want to get any more song from amazon until that problem is non-existent .
0	the instrumentation is amazing , the vocal are very good but when i first heard the lyric i just thought wtf . this ha got to be a joke . why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song . i wa extremely let down . it still give me hope for the sound of this upcoming album . if the lyric were any better this would be one the most badass song ever .
1	good album .
1	midwest rock band pay homage to long tradition of not-quite-live live album . high energy song punctuated by strong harmony . fun record if you like old school rock and are looking for something new .
1	my mom love this cd . i made her day .
1	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record them . some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the mat . others are not so great , but they may grow on me . ( but not that one about bird . ) i am just happy paul is digging out some gem and recording them in an inspired way . if it take romance to make that happen , so much the better .
0	pay atttention . from a mix tape and doe not have the whole song ( pointless )
0	only 3 good song .
1	this is a song that will probably be one that is an all time hit . i love everything about it .
0	cd no good , no refund
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to . this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel . this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix . some of the song are downright painful to listen to , but they are still fascinating to listen to . most of the music in this album come from their first few collection , such a shadow and nightmare , ash , and dynasty . there is a much , much darker , evil , grating sound . it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie . for whatever reason , the song to die on halloween is hand down , the creepiest song in this whole album . it ha a very light , almost fun bounce to it , but the lyric are downright horrifying . chop off a limb . batter and bake , what do we get from the light of the sun ? a nasty burn now is not that fun ? it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid . it is just fantastically brilliant .
1	great for gym time
1	love it
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want . but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade . at least elvis wa able to produce some brilliance in this area , like blue christmas . this is tweedily dumb .
0	wow , what a load of garbage . if you watch the movie , the music might make sense . a a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it , the album is an epic fail . the cellist , dave eggar , might be accomplished and all , but that doe not really come across on this album . and if you are a fan of amy lee or evanescence , there is nothing to see here . amys vocal appear on maybe 5 % of the whopping 30 minute the album play for . the one song amy wrote for the album , push the button , is easily the effort worst track . sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot behind the dj in ibiza , it is completely out of place on the album a a whole . stay clear of this piece of crap .
1	saw the video for this song back when mtv wa mtv . loved the funky vibe , make you want to put on a hat and dance on a theater stage ( it doe for me ! ) . : - )
1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on . one is that we will die . another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding , heavy , jam filled album and once again , they do not disappoint at all . mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo . despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year , he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry , heavy snarling vocal performance . the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a great call and response section . motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doe not change with the infectious til the end . every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale , a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil . not very many band could pull off a stone cover , but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song ! i wa smiling from ear to ear . lemmy doe not try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming . this album is pretty much perfect and this band need a # 1 in the u.s. so i urge you , if you want some talented classic metal in your life , pick this album up .
1	love this song
1	my first exposure to this song wa in a disney cartoon . back when mtv played music , my parent purchased dtv video on laser disc that had pop music set to disney animation . this wa my favorite one of them all . i still love this song . for me it is both nostalgic and upbeat .
0	this title is mangled - disco beat , sputtering word that are incomprehesible , then dead silence .
1	lorraine feather is the complete package . here are incredible intelligence and uniqueness , beautiful voice , wide-ranging mood and arrangement . always surprising and satisfying . you must hear lorraine feather to believe it can be this good .
1	he is my favorite
0	this is a poor recording of a great performance . i thought my stereo amplifier wa damaged when i heard the periodic crackling noise while playing the peer gynt suite 1 and 2. but no , i can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise ( but not a pronounced ) when playing the same track on my laptop pc using my bose headphone . this cd might be passable if you just listen to music on an ipod or phone . however , if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo , do not waste your money on this rubbish . i wish i could get my money back .
0	intro is ok lol
1	this wa one of my favorite song from the 60 . i have been putting together a playlist of all my favorite 60 song and this one had to be included .
0	ton of scratch and record skip .
0	i wish i could give this album le than a star . the charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good review on this garbage . snake oil salesman josh feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple . josh will soon have his child do kid bop christian album for sure . if i were amazon or any other business i would block josh from all other future endeavor .
1	just another one of those snappy tune that make me want to move . i love this tune and hope you will try it out .
0	this is not music , it a cry for help . oh my gosh this is awful . not worth 1 star .
1	great song !
0	so sad , so big boring and overproduced compared to the first two . who said coldplay 2.0 ? no , wait , i sometimes like coldplay .
0	a i began listening to this album , two cyclist started chasing me down the street ! i got no action from this album at all .
1	sent to a friend and now they love to hear him sing also . hope he recovers from his operation . thanks
0	the worst of billy joel . he should stick to studio album and even retire . his voice is not holding up .
1	amazon make purchasing song really easy and is unmatched in quality when it come to the ease of purchase and the quality of it all .
0	a of this writing , many of the track on this album are misnumbered/mislabled .
0	i would rather donate my money to a corrupt charity [ . ] . reason why 50 cent is the best ! 1. i can relate to his lyric in da club and pimp 2. he on the radio and mtv all day ! ( which mean he talented ) 3. he ha talent ! because he doesnt play any instrument .
0	i bought this for my brother , and wa dumb enough to listen to it before i gave it too him . i have heard a thousand country song that say the same thing , just with different word . somebody stole my truck , some guy ran off with my girlfriend , somebody shot my dog , and i am too drunk to do anything about any of it . do not waste your time and money . just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little . you will get the same result . tear in your beer .
1	i am glad i purchased this selection due the fact that i have been searching for this song and the artist . amazon try to provide this and doe such a great job . thanks
0	ala this wa not the original recording . nostalgia aint what it used to be .
1	michael john poirier ha a soothing voice that match his sublime lyric . i love two song on this album especially : forgiven and the maiden and the messenger . forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who ha an angelic voice . i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger . michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it , asking what i thought of the song . i loved it the first time i heard it and have loved it ever since . the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you hear it . i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head . the album is worth it for just these two song . the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ- drawn by a mutual friend .
0	mary poppins soundtrack wa the best purchase i have made so far . i bought it for my granddaughter birthday because she love mary poppins . she can sing all the song in the soundtrack and i love hearing her
1	perfect for reminiscing . affordable price esay download and i can carry this part of my past with me for whenever i need a blast from the past .
1	excellent service and product . very satisfied .
1	i purchased this album a part of a workshop we presented in my art fraternity , gamma xi phi . listening to it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black art movement to the modern era . ms. sanchez present a work that is smart , bold , witty , and deep . this wa my first time hearing her perform a opposed to reading her work in a book . a a gay person , i must admit i wa taken aback by some of the language in one of the poem , but i had to realize that this wa recorded during the black art movement , a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poet of the time . in spite of that language and those idea , this is a solid piece of work .
1	i think this is a great album . there is not one song i dislike on this cd . i defiantly recommend buying this album .
1	at first i thought this wa a keith urban but i wa surprised that it wa jason mraz , but i still love it .
0	not a energetic a other version . i wa expecting a little bit more . might be fine for background music etc , but not the song i wa looking for
1	i like messianic music , so this wa a treat for me . many paul wilbur work , but others a well .
0	the trail hear did not sound like a mix- i do not like downloading any mixes- i like original music- these were all for my prom birthday party in november . still will play the tune but not what i originally wanted .
1	i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio station coming out of chicago . when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which a far a im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever
1	this music relaxes and soothes . i am anxiously awaiting the next damien escobar cd .
1	it is a good cd
0	i feel like a traitor saying this , but i will not be buying this set any time soon . i stand second-to-none in my affection for the band , but unfortunately , this career-spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 year of that recording career . by my count , there are only about five song on this set that were released after 1980. not good enough . capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered song , and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads .
1	critic have called this the best soul album ever . they are right . this is the best non-greatest hit soul album one can buy . outstanding singing , precision producing make this a can not miss album . the album look like a greatest hit package with ghetto child , one of a kind love affair , how could i let you get away , i will be around and others . the first track , just can not get you out of my mind get you going and you will not be able to turn it off .
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube . when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system . after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production . hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice , but that wasnt allowed to come through . the second song , edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background . the piano virtually drowned out her voice . this wa also the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example . whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan . i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company .
1	great mix !
1	thanks for getting it to me on time and a described . got ta love doing this dance !
1	love this album . one of his best . if you like this one you will love & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/self-made/dp/b0014567mk/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > self made < /a > from his homie mike jones
0	suck !
1	beautiful ! song .
0	i just heard light on for the first time . my first thought wa oh no ! this can not be your first real single . so i played it again and again . and again . nothing changed . no chill of excitement . nothing ! i wa a huge fan of this guy on idol and i loved how creative and original he wa . he made every song he sang sound like a modern hit . only to get a run of the mill , very basic , cliche , almost 80ish sounding rock song . complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest note ? let u just hope the rest of the album is much better . it ha to be !
0	blase and uninspired , sadly , a wa most of his music from this album .
1	this album is amazing . i have been a tough sell lately on new music - especially on first listen throughs . but i wa instantly hooked . if you like zaba , you will like this . it is different , but in a good way .
1	great album ! no track on it that i dislike ; every one is worth listening to . the lyric are interesting , the musical style is varied and frankly just sound cool , and it is a nicely long album which i always appreciate . worth every penny .
1	best version of one of my favorite song that i have ever heard . watch it with video on youtube to take in the whole scenario , visually stunning a well a a joy to listen to .
1	love it
1	top of my list . do you like to dance , to get your groove moving . elle king , where is she on the chart ? she should be ranking up there .
0	i love dt & i respect them for taking a chance but this album doe not work for me . i suspect that i would enjoy it more if i give it more time but i am just not interested in investing the time right now .
0	this version is the live of dream on and not the studio version . still a great song but it would have been nice if it said it wa the live version .
1	wy i like all the cd because she wa the best of the best a a wife and a mother .
0	yes , this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden . steve may be the main composer in maiden , but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself . he doe need the other 5 guy . also , it dissapoints that harris got this singer , richard taylor , for the album . the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle . i am not saying bruce should have been on the album , but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and gotten a decent singer . even blaze bailey is a good singer , he did not have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron maiden requires , but blaze bailey can sing . i do not know who told this richard taylor that he could sing !
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd . i have always liked dj shadow , and wa interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now ( in 2016 ) . it is typical shadow ambiance and found sound , but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like . a few track attempt a dubstep feel , but it come across a plodding . a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern . those actually sound the coolest . the part that make me absolutely dislike the album ( even though part are ok ) is the rapper in the rap track that state that trump ha sex with his youngest daughter . so eff that rapper . i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wan na lose half of your audience . moby just did the same , i am selling all his cd now a he mouthed off too about trump .
1	love this music . voice are amazing . beautiful in every way . loved it from the very first time i heatd it .
0	downloaded just fine . not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than i did not like the song and it work just fine .
1	mix in well with other song in cardio workout . when you get a little winded this will help keep you up .
0	i did not realize that zappa had more than one recorded version of peach en regalia . the version on hot rat merit 5 star . this version left me greatly dissapointed .
0	i love this song i.accually searched for two week to find it then i had a brainstorm and used shazzam , and got it that way my 15 month old dance evrytime it come on . luv it .
0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of year ago . delayed a my review may be it is sincere . i am a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one of the best band of the bosstown rock scene . i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track . i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris record . i suppose i should have asked them for a full refund but i somehow opted not to do it .
1	the grandkids love it . thanks !
1	wonderful !
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity , which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register , and is a very successful song , most of the track on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song , with vitas singing usually in a middle register . track 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 were co-written by vitas , track 8 , 10 and 11 written by him alone . total playing time is 36:15. i simply adore this cd . it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy , enthusiasm and love . vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity . it is impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd , but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me . a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from . always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating ( a minimum of 98 % ) , a vitas , like many performer , especially those from distant land , is plagued with pirated disc . play list : 1 : a kiss a long a eternity . beautiful , melodic ballad . 2 : where is you , there is me . kuda ti , tuda ya ! get on your dancing shoe . 3 : do not keep silence so loudly . fabulous ! with some exotic techno sound . 4 : unlucky . a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy . 5 : half night half day . absolutely irresistible . 6 : heartbeat . try not dancing to this one . i dare you ! 7 : in short and a t shirt . keep those dancing shoe on ! 8 : mantra . nice techno flavor in this one . 9 : street of the capital . a cheerful , bouncy song , with a hint of that upper register . 10 : i believe in love . with sweet gentleness , this is all love . 11 : internet mood . no lyric in this one , just techno sound and the voice a instrument .
1	i lost my cd of the manhattan so i picked up my hit here . great love song .
1	why do not we see this chick on tv ? i have heard her only occasionally on the radio , and her rendition are so smooth and sentimental . so well-done that she should be way on top !
0	love this song , but wa very disappointed in how soft the background vocal are . hard to achieve a good blend .
1	fantastic ! possibly his best album yet
0	i saw this song and artist on octane from sirius xm . whatever i bought is not it . these guy seem very angry .
1	love it
0	i have been a fan of heart since 1976 but i must say this album is a stinker . i thought the sister wilson wanted to rock on this record . sorry . but i aint hearing it here .
1	i do not care what religion she is ; the music is good , and i hope her publicity stunt really pay off . all those rich celebrity who are in the closet a conservative did not have the gut to do what she did yesterday ! she is a strong , independent , fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrity to just come out already !
1	love the music ! great interesting , sound well
0	oh please . whomever keep saying pearl jam is better than nirvana need to let up . pearl jam is worse than nirvana , yet i despise both . they both sold out . vedder gladly obliged to be a medium puppet , and kurt knew what he wa getting into when he signed with a major . yet kurt still did not care to fufill what wa asked of him . he had always been lazy , and nevermind reflects that . it is pure pop-rock on par with bon jovi , and he refused to admit it . there is no punk sensibility to it at all .
1	we just got this for christmas and it is a wonderful cd ! my four year old is asking great question about the song .
0	it is unfortunate that there is not a negative rating scale . the disc took five week to arrive . both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal , even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging . recycled the day it arrived .
0	the absolutely worst song ever made . if you like screaming through the whole song , then you will love it . me , i like some melody and rhythm and not a bunch of woooo aaaaaa eeeeaaaaaaa .
1	an awesome pure worship experience that you will want to experience over and over again and never get tired of listening to !
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash . it is a shame what pass for hip-hop these day . people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric , which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all , because lil wayne is whack . i am not a hater , i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all . he is just another average , untalented , main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pas off a hip-hop . also , the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach . if this dude the best there is , you guy can have him ; i prefer a little more substance in my music .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
1	the first time i heard this song , it wa during a time where i wa sad almost every day . thing were not looking good for me . but the song , the lyric spoke to me and helped me to cheer up . very inspirational for me .
1	beautiful . thank you !
1	awesome song !
1	i love jason album !
1	this brings me back to my younger year - my college day when ll wa still my boo : - ) i have grown up since then but i still love this song .
1	love it !
0	didnt order
1	great song
0	uninspired garbage . such a disappointment . i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out . i could not be more unhappy . uninspired is the best way to describe it . it seems so half-assed when compared to their previous album .
1	it is a song , you either like it or you do not . i like it and therefore am recommending it to you . : )
0	this is a waste of money i got a cd with no book and no talk on cd they sell something new now which is the same old thing with new cover very disappointing sorry ed sueta
0	i never ordered this !
0	i could not download all 930 or so mp3s from the cloud player without clicking them 1 at a time . however , thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free , i wa able to find the site bible.is . on that site they have the complete bible , plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized version of kjv , nasb , esv , and contemporary english . if this product did not need to be downloaded through cloud player , i would have given it a 4/5 star . that is 4/5 not 5/5 because i do not really like the background music .
0	the record wa warped
0	lame , anyone who buy this is clearly an idiot . nigg * over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat . rap suck .
0	not a great a his previous cd , some great tune but mostly a disappointment . i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an mp3 would best suit you .
0	thought the artist were the original singer . they were community theatre caliber . ok , but off broadway . best song from the best musical , but not the best singer . come on man !
0	not happy with this one , do not know if it wa my fault or not but after the download the song disappeared into the bowel of my computer and i still can not find it .
1	i will make this brief a usual . tha animatrix dvd is what turned me onto anime , it is also a slight bit disturbing , but you know a well a i do that u 21st century human need to be disturbed once in a while . i always loved the music from the dvd , so decided , why not get the soundtrack ? and i did . what i did not expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie ( in musical term ) . there is only one track on this cd that i do not like , and that is saying a lot . it is an interesting journey . through a synthetic world , via trance and techno beat . check it out , you will not be disappointed .
0	sound like rap and i do not care a bit for it
1	always love to listen to waylon and jessi .
1	will put you in the mood !
1	i discovered amazon cloud and the first piece i downloaded wa der teufel and the sound fill the room . i recommend the cloud and the schubert for .89 , how can you go wrong .
0	embedded drm prevents burning amazon.com downloaded mp3 to a cd . digital player only . i do not recommend these downloads for this reason .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away . kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill , from marrying kim kardashian , to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy-winning album of the year . now , for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney , the question is have they have better in their art , well the answer is absolutely no . kanye showed it badly on only one , now with fourfive second , the two of them do not ignite in the heart , instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice , and in chemistry with sir paul . overall , i wasnt even impressed with the song , and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before . if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan , i would sincerely pas this one up , because four and five second , feel more like wasted time overall . song : f
0	ha that garage/grunge band sound . just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s i have collected , and forgettable . nice cover though .
1	this worship ( my season personally ) wa awesome .
1	great tune .
1	this is my favorite version of nessun dorma bar none and i include in this , pavrotti , domingo , etc . although they are supposedly more tecnically correct , i am so taken by the emotion in boccellis voice that there is no comparison for me .
0	great
0	i do not understand this at all . there are no redeeming quality to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist . i am a avid a fan of bob dylan a there is but he doe not serve himself well with atrocity such a this or that inane christmas album . i have to go listen to blood on the track and oh mercy now before my mind implodes .
1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying , i wanted pretty hate machine - part ii , and the such . anybody who ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he release . you will never get a part ii to any nin album , because , from the beginning , trent reznor set out to do one thing : innovate . rehashing old album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature . ghost , however , pushing trent reznor to his creative edge . the mission : to create an instrumental soundscape , rather than an album reliant on verse-chorus-bridge structure . the mission wa , indeed , successful . ghost present beautiful piano passage , soothing swarm of saturated noise , and harsh , electronic beat . a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydream , which is how he describes ghost . the song are , to their core , trent reznor , without rehashing , recycling , or regurgitating his past effort , making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy .
0	i just finished downloading ( from the cloud ) and there is a problem . four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp ( on a window xp system ) . the bad track are : ( disc 1 ) track 04 ( disc 1 ) track 08 ( disc 2 ) track 10 ( disc 2 ) track 13 if i try to open them in window medium player , nothing happens ; the name doe not even appear in the playlist . if i try to open them in winamp , then ( disc 1 ) track 01 ( canon ) play instead ! i believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long . window will not even let you rename them in the normal way . update : i have found a workaround to the file problem , which is listed at the end of this review . * also : several of the track are not relaxing , imho . for example , disc 1 track 9 ( violin sonata ) ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst . not relaxing to me . disc 2 track 4 ( ballade no . 1 ) ha several section that are quite loud and heavy-handed , and a section near the end that is quite agitated . disc 2 track 10 ( sonata for two piano ) begin quietly , but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive . disc 2 track 16 ( minuet in g ) ha a few section that are downright bombastic , with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo . indeed , classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific . but the selection on this pair of mp3 disc seems to be quite erratic . to point out just one glaring example : where is brahms lullabye ? buy this a a general sampler , if you like . but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it is finished . * file repair solution a i suspected , the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path ( the entire route that the computer take to get to the file ) . window allows a maximum of 255 character for the path + name . by default , when you download these , amazon will put them in this path : c : \documents and settings\all users\documents\amazon\various artists\a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe\ that is 135 character right there , which leaf 120 character for the track name . now let u consider the name of one of the non-functional file : ( disc 2 ) 10 - sonata for two piano in f minor , op . 34b_ ii . andante , _un poco adagio_ - sonata for two piano in f minor , op . 34b_ ii . andante , _un poco adagio_.mp3 that is 165 character . so the total is 135 + 165 = 300 character , well over the 255-character limit . window just can not handle that ! a a workaround , after you have downloaded all the file , navigate to the folder a listed above . temporarily rename the folder something very short , like xyz ( without the quotation mark ) . that is 65 character shorter than the original file name . now the total are under 255 character , so window will let you rename the individual file . go through and chop out all the duplicate information . in the example given above , you will cut out 72 character , leaving a total of 93 character . do this for all the track . finally , if you want , you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable , like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of 94 character . if you add the new file name ( from the example above ) which is 93 character , you will see that you end up with a total of 187 character , well under the 255 character limit . of course one wonder : why did not amazon think about this , and use a reasonable album name , and file name without duplication , in the first place . my conclusion : given that at least four of the track are not relaxing , and you will have to spend at least 15 minute screwing around to fix the file naming error , imho this collection just is not worth the trouble , even if it is free to begin with . of course if you are really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing . go for it . personally , i think amazon could and should do a better job . i know i would , if i worked for them .
0	love the goat , but this song . well , seems they used so much creative energy in coming up with the title they had little left for the actual song .
0	thie album is pretty good , redneck crazy is by far the best song . i would not buy music from amazon again . have to use their player to down load and it is crap . have to pa 25 a year to add your track to it if you have over 250
1	it is awesome ! so glad a cd came out .
1	they just do not make song like this anymore . very good song . recived in great condition .
0	i downloaded this mp3 after hearing it in an at & t commercial . i like the song , but the mp3 sound absolutely awful . it is just way too compressed . so it is extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range . almost unlistenable . i honestly do not think you can blame a lot of this on the mp3 encoding . 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate , and i have plenty of mp3s that sound fine with lesser bit rate .
0	um . no .
1	beautiful song ! worship worship worship ! amen .
0	i bought this version before i saw that the u.s. navy band had also recorded the irish national anthem . the navy band version , in my opinion , is much better . more upbeat .
1	it more than met my expectation . barbra did it again .
0	if you like the movie you love the soundtrack , i know i did
0	never rec it
1	one of the best sweet romantic song of all-time i think , true love wait and true love never grows old or give up and grows sweeter over time
0	this cd sound tinny . there is no base , just too much treble . it sound like listening to a cd on a boombox with the bass boost turned off .
1	beautiful song by leonard cohen .
1	love love love
1	i am a little late to join the party when it come to this artist , but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for thinking out loud on youtube ( i did not realize it had been played to death on the radio according to friend ) i love the cd . it is awesome to find an artist that actually play real instrument , writes their own music , with lyric that actually convey human emotion . wonder never cease .
1	good song
1	big third day fan and this did not disappoint !
0	very slick only giving the weeknd a single hook verse otherwise he would have killed this song . very dissapointed do not buy if you are looking for the weeknd
0	i thought this wa sung my dottie rambo , did not like it since it wasnt . i wa after hers not someone el .
0	barefootin wa on there , which is not the song we were after . we wanted let go baby , which wa supposed to the b side , but instead it wa mountain of love by harold something or another . it came from a series of collectible .
0	i am not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set . but ddamn , ss13 ? really ? pretty sad omission here . new slayer fan : start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog . this is a waste .
1	this product is simply a recorded countdown for each 20 second interval of exercise and 10 second of rest for a total of 8 cycle .
1	love this song ! it is very catchy and very cute . this whole album is such a wonderful find . my infant son and i really have enjoyed every song , but this is one of our top 3 !
1	amazing work from alt j a always , my favorite song on the album are nara and every other freckle .
0	for one , it wa the short verision or radio version . also , they gave the impression that it wa un-edited but it wa , not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar . i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content .
0	if the u shock & awe campaign rained a many bomb a joe derosas latest comedy album doe , the iraq war wouldve been won in a week .
0	maybe it is just my age showing but i like jazz and i like most pre 2000 rock but this wa terrible . i collect a lot of music even some i do not care for but this one i deleted right after i listened to it .
0	i bought ti for my son who is a music major . he loved it
0	another overrated band to grace the late night tv airwave . they do not have much to back up their late night acclaim though . notable song are lacking , this album sound like a kid garage arrangement on some home computer .
1	great mid-tempo song . make me smile . great for workout , long drive , etc . brings you up . would like more of the same .
1	i am sure that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest , but this one doe the trick for me . i have been more than a casual fan since he appeared on fernwood tonight and sang the piano ha been drinking . tom version of jersey girl ( the original ) can not be beat . the heart of saturday night ? nothing really need to be said . if you want to try tom wait on for size , starting here is not a bad idea . great stuff .
0	would it kill amazon to get the original version of this song ? this remix is pure dreck , avoid like the plague .
0	what ha happened to country music ? i call this crock ! let u get back to the steel guitar and the fiddle and the cheatin and drinkin song that have a story .
0	this album suck . like the other 1 star reviewer wrote , it is all commercial radio garbage . it is so overproduced , it is hard to listen to . i have been listening to the band since the late 90 and if you want to hear good o.a.r . you have to see them live or buy their first live cd . if you like this album , you are probably a new o.a.r . fan , or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 album back . which is not a criticism , but for people who remember them when they first started , their change to this is definitely a shock . sorry , but it is what it is .
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others , but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare .
1	this cd will have you moving to beat . all of the song are great and the production is top quality !
1	sublime .
1	love slipknot new album , i am a huge fan aka maggot , highly recommend to all the maggot out there
0	katy perry second hit song , is very . catchy but it is annoying . it is one of those song you can not help but hum certain part to and the video is just . well , it is just there . i thought the lady dancing with the umbrella or whatever wa kinda cool the first time i saw it but i wa wrong . this song is just the flavor of the week and when i first heard it i did not like it . it is gotten a bit better since then but do not expect this to win any grammies , lol 2.5 star .
0	selfies are annoying enough , i do not see why an annoying song wa necessary . the white girl voice in this song is so unbelievably annoying . i want to just smash my headphone . i mean yes , it ha a catchy tune , but it is not the type of song that you spend money on . look up on youtube , watch it once , and then never discus it again .
1	love it
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success . with that gone , my guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag in 2 year while staying with andy kindler in his studio
0	it ok , not what i expected .
0	this wa a single cd and if i would have known that i would have not ever purchased it . thanks
0	i found it poorly performed and since the nutcracker is one of my favorite , i wa disappointed . do not download .
0	started out very slow , just could not feel it !
0	i do not have the download . help guideline not working , the cancel button wa hit immediately but account still charged , please credit my account
1	a beautiful song , a hymn of earlier day , and who better to do it than fernando ortega ? the one-star review really should not be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose , but rather an accident on someone part . this song deserves 5 star .
1	great song . no one but him could sing it with such feeling . love that song and singer . thank you george .
1	greate
0	i purchased the song because i wanted to hear it with both bryan may and luciano pavarotti . and pavarotti doe not sing it !
0	never had
0	did not like this album . totally hated la llave de mi corazon it sounded like the song you would hear on a burger king commercial . why add the english lyric ? there is no need for it . i am totally disappointed and deleting from my ipod . get all of his previous material , because it is really world class .
0	this guy is not funny . he is mean spirited and intolerant . i hated it . i am sorry i spent my money on it .
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy . i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago . kind of like the 72/73 miami dolphin . i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl . same here with chicago . 60 and 70 with their intense musical and political statement . and then 80 and 90 mega wimpy commercial hit . chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60 and 70 . such a shame ! it is also sad they sold out once again ! i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance . in many interview during their 15 year musical hiatus , robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band . the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy . they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek . i also think that wea ( now and former label ) had creative control for this project . well . i am certain they will get some hit from this . 3 minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today . the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel , 90 degree , already gone , better . if there wa no champlin , i would give it 0 star . since champlin wa coerced to do this cd , i give it 2 star for bill voice and songwriting talent . the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago 31. ooops ! i will not hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song . too bad !
0	why wa the price so low ? all the track are mislabeled .
1	not really a fan of the artist but i do like this song . great to listen to when i am at the gym for motivation .
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen . i wa pleasantly surprised . from the first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming some of the tune . i could not wait to play it again .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that . after two run-through , this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to . great player , but mediocre songwriter : probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue .
1	here come the mummy are wonderful ! their music is exceptional , make you want to get up and move . i have missed this kind of music , it is hard to find now day and it is original . the lyric are also very original . they are funny and full of innuendo . if you ever have a chance to see them in person do not pas it up !
1	it wa what i wa after .
1	i absolutely love this singer artist . she ha quite a voice and she delivers in every song she sings . enjoy !
1	love the message and the music !
1	i liked this song when i first heard it on the loud speaker at the gym , while i wa working out with weight .
0	this song wa absolutely horrible ! it wa very distasteful and lacked structure . i do not recommend this song for anyone . in fact , if every cd nick lowe made exploded , i would not have a problem ! it is terrible . do not buy or get this song ! warning warning do not buy !
0	first of all i admire and respect alvin and am sorrowed at his passing . this album wa not one of his best . the guitar work is weak and the song are very disjointed .
0	it reminded me of jimi with an srv twist , wonderful .
1	love it !
0	dear fireflight , please release electro-pop under another name or a side project . this will , i believe , alienate your current fan , i know it ha me . if i wanted christian katy perry , then i would listen to , uh , old katy perry .
0	could not turn it off fast enough .
0	i am a huge floyd fan . i love everything since dark side , and much from before dark side . i love post-waters floyd , floyd with roger water , and i love a lot of the solo song from water , from gilmour , and from wright . i did not enjoy this album . i heard it once through and that wa enough . i do not think it is a money grab , it just suck . edit : perhaps floyd , or at least those that remain , deserve an album retrospect , in whatever way they desire . that is what i consider this . i just would not have bought it if i had heard it first .
0	this album make me sick . it is generic and boring . same stupid drum beat in 90 % of the song . what happened ? way to go guy , you sound like s * . i am clearly upset . i could cry . mumford and son are dead . they should have changed their band name with this album . disgusted . this is sissy music horse s * .
1	magic
0	the first two were great and they will have shelf life . this wa rushed out for christmas & anyone that gave it more tan 2stars must be related . bad review like this cost u money & make the artist believe they did something right < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/iron-man-ultimate-two-disc-edition-bd-live-blu-ray/dp/b001gapc1k/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > iron man ( ultimate two-disc edition + bd live ) [ blu-ray < /a > ]
1	really love this song . it wa used in the movie trailer for the secret life of walter mitty and the song is pretty addictive to listen to .
0	i gave this a listen . a friend of mine know i am a big fan of frank , etc , so he thought i would like this . but , like so many young guy out there trying to sing like sinatra ( i am looking at you , mike buble ! ) , they fail because they have no heart . now , technically , seth is a good singer . i do not particularly care for his singing voice , but obviously he is got some talent there . i almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover . i would like it more if they were not trying so hard to invoke the image of frank old lp cover . but seth singing ha absolutely no heart , no soul , whatsoever . and this is what is missing in the singing of today ; anyone who think they can pull off singing , doe , and we are left with a glut of talented singer , very few of whom i ever care to hear . this is one of them . i just can not take it . it is empty singing . no heart . - not to mention , it is frickin brian griffin singing ! ? impossible to listen to .
0	heard this on a movie and really dug the lyric . have not really listened to it since i downloaded it . the intro wa too long for me , and i do not like the vocal they are shaky like there is hardly any talent . once i heard the whole song the lyric are not a impressive a when i heard it on the movie .
0	would not let me play the song exception # 184 .
0	i wa really excited to get this cd a i already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it . it arrived soon enough , however when i listened to it hardly any of the song listed on the back are actually on the cd . this is really disappointing . i do not know if it is a manufacturing error but it really a shame that they did not check it . the song are not a good a the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to have one track list on the cd and another on the cd cover . now i will have to look for it next time i go to mexico and will not be ordering it again .
0	i managed to listen to this entire album without buying it . that wa one of the best thing i have done . let me say up front that i do not care a whit about ms. winehouses personal life . and i have no problem with odd voice ( or even weak voice when the music is right , ala eric clapton ) . here , i just do not see what all the fuss is about . the voice is pedestrian , the style is borrowed , the arrangement are second rate , the song are , in my view , incredibly boring , and the overall product quality is nil . i have a wide range of taste , from bob dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical . i see or hear no reason to purchase ms. winehouses warblings because they just are not good enough . they are boring !
1	outstanding , bluish .
0	on the whole , the album is definitely not in the same league a a good pat boone album . however , i have found , when played at medium level , it doe provide measurable relief for hemmoroid suffering .
0	csn , deja vu , after the gold rush . these were the album that helped to define an era for some of u . csn never supassed that first album , either collectively or individually though they did have some good song on some album . neil young wa able to transcend the era , that is why he still is a vital recording artist . nostalgia make me sad . i do not need it .
0	this is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performance ever recorded . the cracking noise make it almost unlistenable , completely unworthy of the quality of gmos fine session . you can hear the crackle in the preview - yes , it is that bad and worse all the way through . i am surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy ; sound like it wa made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment . this recording of the same performance is much cleaner : http : / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0013arzcm/
1	great song !
1	this is a great album no doubt . the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard . fade to black is an absolute classic . maybe missing a little ball though in this one .
1	from one of my favorite movie , this song can bring out so much emotion and feeling . love love love it .
1	1. waltz for j.d . 9:57 . 2. pretty bossa 8:40 . 3 . 6/8 thing 9:07 . 4. blue and green 8:36 . 5. this is new 6:06 . 6. fit for a prince 7:00 . 7. alphabet city 7:56 . 8. the loop 5:48 . 9. she is leaving home 10:02. john bishop , drum . jon davis , piano . paul gabrielson , bass . steve hill , drum . produced by paul gabrielson .
0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .
1	i wa too guilty to like this song . i mean , the beibs ? but once i learned that ed sheeran co-wrote it , i could live with myself . all is again right with the world .
0	this is only relevant for the vinyl version . this is about the piece of plastic itself , not the music . i am a very big panic ! fan . once i saw brendon tweeted about this , i preordered it . i received it on the day of the release , april 1 , all good . only today i got to listen to it . 1. it is all just a tiny-bit too high pitched . playing it in sync next to a digital version of the same song you can hear it , and even without . 2. first time i played it , and i swear i watched this thing like a hawk and cared for it like it wa my child , there is a lot of jumping in victorious and do not threaten me with a good time .
0	destined to appear on worst ever list for decade . knock william shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever . dylan wa always a horrid singer , but we forgave him because he wa a brilliant poet . here he mutilates the exhausted warhorse we have all come to despise . you simply can not believe your ear .
0	she did a song in english so you guy can also understand the meaningless thing she ha to say . and this song is the most meaningless she ever did . but her voice sound much stronger . this is not a typical blmchen-song . there are many backgroungsingers and more lyric . there are three song on this single . the radio version , the extended version and the song where heart have wings.it is the english version of her song herzen haben flgel . i think it is on the blossom-album heartbeat
0	this cd is absolute garbage . sellout britny spears/green day clone pop for public consumption . avoid everything from descendent and all in the 90 and later !
1	just like the movie .
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately , and not for her music . it ha been for her work with american idol , and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split . but for her latest single , she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before , and fails to do it on papi , the third single from her album love ? the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career . in fact , hearing it now , feel like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger . good luck to jennifer on her other project , but love ? wasnt really feeling the love at all , with the exception of on the floor . song : d
0	garbage . joe derosa is not a funny man .
0	take some no-doze before you listen to this one .
0	the tune wa a repeat of past have fun teaching song and too advance for my 4/5 year old . i am able to a adjust most of three other song i have purchased . the other song like water cycle were great
0	have no clue what this is
1	jerry playing wring so much feeling out of every note , and everything he play is so tasteful and rich . yum .
1	i love how her music let you create your own imaginative scenario or remember special thing . sometimes no word are necessary and her music allows you to go to a quiet place and not be distracted by lyric and allows you to be with your own thought .
0	the live version is not the version i wanted . do not care for all that talking during the song . i deleted it .
0	unfortunately this album doe not contain all of the shanty which is a shame , since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the military and these are very similar to our cadence . since this album doe not contain all of them , here is the youtube video with 35 of the 36 shanty . [ . ]
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want .
1	hear it for yourself !
1	this is a beautiful album inside and out . from the moment the package arrives- it is such a beauty to behold- the packaging immediately take you on a journey and then you put the album on and it is such an awesome experience . transporting , timeless , exciting , meditative , beautiful , just so many quality wrapped up into a wonderful musical experience . so much to enjoy & to go back to and re discover
0	sorry . but , that is ridiculous ( my opinion ) .
1	nice product . would recommend this seller .
0	love cyndi lauper but it suck big time that my ipad 1 can not use this prime music which i am paying for
0	received wrong cd !
1	a very strong set of song , both lyrically and melodically . and robin is in good voice throughout .
1	you know , i am just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the difference from original to remastered . but i will say , paying $ 60 ( or $ 70 or $ 80 ) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous . i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fan ; i became aware during the born in the usa tour , then purchased all the previous cassette . so , in the last 28 year , cassette were lost and/or became obsolete . now i am able to purchase all seven for what amount to $ 8.50 each . that is a win right there . and like a number of people , i find the first seven springsteen to be the best , sans a couple of live album . so , win-squared . $ 60 to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with .
1	great . sound a i remember it .
1	1968 wa a year filled with social unrest , and the music in this hour-long cd reflects that . from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection , born to be wild by steppenwolf , to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation , on through the mournful abraham , martin , and john by dion , this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest , and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr. but even in the uneasy social climate of 1968 , respite wa found in music . there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal , the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees , and the gorgeous slow-dance soul ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics . this cd focus on the hit , so if you are looking to delve deeper into the music of 1968 , look elsewhere . but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the 1960s .
1	tennessee-born chester burton atkins ( 6/20/24 - 6/30/01 ) wa co-creator with owen bradley of the nashville sound . he produced record for elvis , the everly brother and so many others , but chets true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing . this pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen grammys and wa instrumentalist of the year nine time . he is a member of the rock and roll , country music and musician hall of fame . rca victor 1964 lp entitled the best of chet atkins wa issued in both mono ( lpm 2887 ) and simulated stereo ( lsp-2887e ) . three here are * chet original , while * two were co-written with boudleaux bryant . there are no charting single on this album . side one [ 2:56 ] jitterbug waltz [ 2:27 ] peanut vendor [ 2:27 ] djangos castle ( manoir de me rf ) [ 2:15 ] * blue ocean echo [ 2:01 ] * yankee doodle dixie [ 2:30 ] swedish rhapsody side two [ 3:57 ] vanessa [ 2:15 ] * trambone [ 2:45 ] malaguea [ 2:21 ] meet mister callaghan [ 2:15 ] * main street breakdown [ 1:53 ] * country gentleman total time : 30:02
0	oddly amusing song . wa curious after hearing the song with her and new hubby chad kroeger . lyric for the younger audience , good beat !
0	considering the review and the pedigree and the musicianship . just no soul , the singing . voice , doe not work ( for me ) i get - that they are good - just reminded me of the good stuff from the 70
0	this is one of the worse gospel compilation i have heard . this ha nothing to do with gospel . it is a mix-match of melody , poorly played .
1	heard it in a movie , and wanted it . it wa hard to find online , but amazon had it for a cheap price , very happy with this track .
0	i actually like instrumentals , but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration . also , all of the song did not download with the album . that wa the most disappointing . maybe next time .
0	this cd ha onley one good song on it do not waist your money on it just go to itunes and buy it what a waist of money
1	here is another release from a band that had been dormant for year , so here is the verdict : monotheist is just pure greatness . i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost , and while there is some experimentation in here to a greater degree , it all work organically to achieve some scary result . the album is also full of slow , crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut , which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience you will ever come across . the song are lengthy and repetitious and that is what make them effective . while it is hard to classify this opus , it is safe to say that it is a doom metal album . there is a lot of stuff going on , it never get boring . listen deep into the music and you will find something new by each listen . tom vocal are harsh , brutal and mysterious , and the production is exceptional . great comeback album , i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece . one of the best album of 2006 so far !
1	i love this song because it reminds me of the movie kill bill . i even use it a a ringtone for my phone .
0	i always liked this song . i like the werewolf of london too . he is a great classic rock artist to listen to .
0	the 2014 remaster is terrible . like so much music remastered these day for mp3 player , it is completely oversaturated , so that the sound is compressed and distorted , and there is almost no dynamic range . the sound file look like a brick . this type of remaster is what give digital sound a bad name and make people long for vinyl . it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster , but this is not one of them . boo !
1	i am just starting to get interested in classical music . this a great bargain . i do not like all of the song but there is a wide variety ; some very familiar . if you want a great overall selection at a great price , this is a must have .
1	i have listened to this over and over and love it every time . it is a wonderful song , especially for easter . thanks
1	we listen to many cd for 1-3 year old . this is the favorite she always request . in fact , this is our second copy . we try others and she dance and sings to them but request her old favorite when painting or dancing .
0	warped upon arrival and water mark all over . doe not play correctly and unable to return . do not recommend .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song . one of mjs best song he did : (
1	awesome !
1	awesome sound .
0	let me break this down , in a rather incomplex fashion , for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan . nirvana , while rebellious , offered nothing new , or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era . i understand , and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there , but cobain did not speak to you . in fact , he loathed you , a he did all of his loyal fan . that is the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such a nirvana . in following them , you are actually defying all that they stand ( or stood ) for , and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan . in fact , by worshipping nirvana , you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy . learn this , and accept it . secondly , the music ( please , stop pleading otherwise ) wa diluted , poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty . his lyric were not poetic , or abstract , or other-wordly , they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist . i also seriously should not need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar . let u simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing . in addition , the rest of the band member were also hardly virtuoso . so , you can cease in claiming that a well . thirdly , an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere . the longevity of an album ( inspect this postulate , it show in what we now consider to be classic ) is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ . time ha repeatedly shown this . and , needle to say , nevermind , and all other nirvana album for that matter , are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan . that is three strike nirvana fan . yep , ( 0-3 ) . so . i will leave you with a sagacious word ( advice , if you will ) regarding a better musical path which it is not too late to pursue . for the love of god ( if one exists ) heed my call , the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do . if you are planning on picking up , or playing , or praising , a nirvana cd , and are doing so because : 1. you despise society , and all that the archetypal american stand for , then you should listen to these album instead : the velvet underground - the vu and nico or white light/white heat the mother of invention - freak out ! or we are only in it for the money the fug - the fug elliott smith - elliot smith or xo radiohead - amnesiac , kid a , ok computer , the bend or hail to the thief 2. you have a mild aversion to consumerism and/or love poignant , heartfelt lyric , then pick up these album instead : leonard cohen - song of leonard cohen or song of love and hate wilco - summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan - highway 61 revisisted , freewheelin , the time they are a-changin blonde on blonde , another side of bob dylan , or bringin it all back home billy bragg - william bloke or talking with the taxman about poetry nick drake - pink moon or five leaf left the beatles - sgt . pepper , revolver , abbey road , white album , rubber soul etc . yo la tengo - i can hear the heart beating a one or and then nothing turned itself inside out 3. you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative , or love gruff or non-traditional sounding vocal , then you should listen to these album instead : television - marquee moon the flaming lip - zaireeka , yoshimi battle the pink robot or the soft bulletin captain beefheart - safe a milk , lick my decal off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday - lady in satin or song for distingue lover van morrison - astral week the pixy - surfer rosa morphine - cure for pain or yes tom wait - rain dog or swordfish trombone jeff buckley - grace or sketch for my sweetheart the drunk 4. you simply love a great guitarist , then pick up these album instead : leo kottke - my foot are smiling , greenhouse or 6 & 12 string guitar robert johnson - king of the delta blue volume 1 and 2 jeff beck - you had it coming , blow by blow or wired dillinger escape plan - calculating infinity king crimson - in the court of the crimson king or starless and bible black built to spill - there is nothing wrong with love or keep it like a secret the jimi hendrix experience - are you experienced ? , axis bold a love or electric ladyland the yardbird - over under sideways down or having a rave up wes montgomery - smoking at the half note or full house 5. you just love well arranged , complex , moving or eclectic music , then pick up these album instead : the zombie - odyssey and oracle the move - shazam charles mingus - pithecanthropus erectus , mingus ah um ! or oh yeah broken social scene - you forgot it in people mile davis - round about midnight , steamin , cookin , sketch of spain or kind of blue art pepper - plus eleven or meet the rhythm section love - forever change or da capo the byrd -notorious byrd brother , turn ! turn ! turn or younger than yesterday the band - the band or music from big pink mahavishnu orchestra - inner mounting flame brian eno - here come the warm jet or another green world p.s . if you really desire something profoundly lyrical , read some poetry . i would suggest theodore roethke , t.s . eliot , allen ginsberg or ezra pound to any nirvana listener , established or potential , ( or basically to anyone for that matter ) .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year , where her voice ha lost it luster , and she really ha not stopped for herself . musically , she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song . her latest song , diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course . i really did not find the song to deliver , a some of her earlier song had . i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice . i definitely think rihanna need to take more time into her song , and not rush into making album after album , year after year . it really ha put a strain on her talent . talk that talk wa awful , and unapologetic is the same way . song : d-
1	found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my mexican vacation folder on my personal website . it fit the bill perfectly a it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that doe not overwhelm the web browsing experience , but wa a delightful addition instead . i have since listened to some more from this artist , and liked most of them , but this particular song is my favorite .
0	this is cute but very small . do not think it is worth the price . it is very soft . doe not seem to keep kid intrigued
0	i am sorry . i have not been able to listen to this all the way through twice . love come to life wa amazing . i suppose this may be a worship album , but it lack all of the dynamic variety of come to life , which ha had me in tear many time . i will be selling it .
1	album of the year ! i love every song ! my only complaint is that the album is too short , so quality over quantity is definitely the case here !
1	the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing . my daughter wa devastated when i told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live . and this song- it wa both our favorite cranberry song . the song haunted my dream the night she passed . my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang . she wa obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her song , and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound . if you have never heard a cranberry record- this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound .
0	i wish i could give this 5 star because i really do love the performance on this album . however , the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album . it is a if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone . it sound really thin . that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp3 format , i really can not give it more than 2 star . this performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release .
0	and this year crud-fest winner , the person who received the most vote from every brain-dead glossy eyed plankton watching . who even care anymore ? yet another drone pulled off the production line , this gimp being another in the long run of inoffensive handsome white boy , aimed primarily at stupid people and , judging by the popularity of this single , there are an awful , awful lot of . so let u talk about the single . with the exception of the excrement that wa last year winner ( steve brookstein , currently missing in action - yet another one-hit wonder who well never see again ) first ( and only ) solo attempt - the dire phil collins cover , this is easily the worst actual attempt at a song yet . originally planned for westlife , that is my goal wa panned and rejected by them ( them ! westlife ! ) for being too weak , but it sure wasnt weak enough for shayne ward , currently number one for the fourth week running a i type this . but what doe that mean , exactly ? i will tell you - nothing . the general public are such idiot , such pathetic , tell u what to buy and we will easily led cretin , that they would buy anything after seeing it on a reality program . shayne ward could have released a record of him whistling the marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one . and it is going to continue , is not it ? this wa a massive hit , the show wa a massive hit , so we are going to continue to be bombarded with bland , generic singer and pointless song like this . if you bought this junk , or if you watched this junk , the curmudgeon hold you personally responsible . you should be ashamed of yourself for bringing yourself down to the gutter mass , watching this easily-digestible pond-life program , and buying it cynical , disgusting product . one day , i hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television , where tv schedule and budget are not ruled by program aimed at the great unwashed , where the chart are not in the vice-like grasp of dire tv talent show winner ( and loser ) . that , lady and gentleman , that , is my goal . the_curmudgeon_hates_you @ yahoo.co.uk
1	so , band of horse is a new band to me . suffice to say , it is now a if i have been a fan for year . their song are infectious , a they are deep and meaningful . the instrumentation , vocal , and composition are fantastic . what a song .
1	johnny cash . enough said .
0	i love dyan . this cd came a a shock . slow , boring , uninspired , dreadful . update , i listened to it again . it is even worse than i thought . his singing is like a parody ; it is amateurish ; he would be laughed off the stage at american idol . horrible ! i can not believe he released this .
1	beautiful . great acoustic . great ballad
0	thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software . i wa trying to figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection of doing so , or ever heard of the artist . very generic song , no redeeming quality for me . sound like just about everything else out there .
0	the two song i really wanted to hear are not on it ; what a waste of money ; is the other music good ? sure , but the missing song make it a big disappointment .
0	it is a good song but nicky minaj is featured . i do not like the way she sings
1	great time to have this a an anthem , i change the lyric to dancing through the wire b/c i am champion sorry katie , but that is what it felt like to me . i had to dance through wire to be with her , dangerous and not a good thing to do .
1	great song ! i cry every time i hear it .
1	another solid song from the new skillet album that showcase their softer side . while this is not nearly the side if skillet i often listen to , it is good enough in it own right . rating : 4
1	this is the best song the widespread panic ha ever released . i love it . no matter my mood this song always pick me right up .
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son-in-law a a joke . because it is . all the 4 & 5 star review crack me up ! especially the one from the holier-than-thou hard core dylan fan . particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it . lolololol ! the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself . the 5 star review are so serious ! unbelievable . ( same thing on itunes- if you want some great entertainment , read the review there for both camp . hilarious ! ) i do not care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur , you have got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre . though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say , some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop , it is horrible in the worse way ! more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard , even . it is so horrible it is so * entertaining * ! i am going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student . a well a non-musical friend . i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both ! one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic . with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him ! oh man , i am listening to this a i type . it hurt my throat so much just listening to him . a one die-hard fan said , this will indeed become a landmark album- much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is . thank you , bob dylan , for this wonderful christmas present . we will listen to it , or a portion of it , every christmas just for a tear-producing laugh . it is a good thing that christmas is in [ his ] heart because it definitely aint in his voice !
0	i had no idea that 9 out of 10 song were not original recording and 5 out of those 9 were flat out horrible . do not waste your money if you want original . i had forgotten how bad k-tell recording were
0	a ha been mentioned in other review , these are not the original hit recording . most , if not all , of the original are available elsewhere .
1	i have listened to this album since i wa a kid and each time it take me back . forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music . i love that it take ancient song we all know and love and put pure soul into them . my favorite track are the overture , every valley , lift up your head , and he shall purify and of course halleujah . all i can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why i love christmas and the holiday season .
0	actually , to say , i do not like it is not totally accurate . it is more than just tolerable , but i guess i wa expecting something more than i got .
1	i had extremely high expectation for mumford & son new album babel after listening to their first release over and over . so not too surprisingly i wa a little disappointed at first . but after a few play through , it grew on me and , while i still believe sigh no more is better album , babel is still a great cd of it own right . i am not a professional reviewer , so i will keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite track ( in no particular order ) . they are mostly made up of the most up-tempo and catchy song on the album . my favorite track on babel : -babel -i will wait -hopeless wanderer -broken crown -the boxer
0	i have down loaded this two time . the song doe not work on my computer . i have had similar situation with down loading music from amazon . they have refunded my money sometimes . but-why doe ten song down load & this one doe not !
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent , in which sound engineer over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder , but damaging the dynamic range . this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war . it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail 2010 remaster of pretty hate machine , and subsequent release of classic beatles record . the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency . god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod ( a note here : the normalization function would do this just fine ) . unfortunately , this is damaging the overall quality of sound . the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube , and i enjoyed it quite a bit . i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by , and wa pleasantly surprised . it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case , with truly gorgeous album art . in a fold on the cover , you have the liner note which list the lyric . everything package wise is very good , and i must say again that the album art - at least for me - is one of the best that ha come in quite a while . but once i ripped it to my pc using eac , my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song . i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed , by going on the dynamic range database . to my dismay , i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression . before i end the review , i must state that this album , music wise , is absolutely fantastic . if not for the poor mastering , i would have easily given the product a 4.5. i can only hope that in the year to come , lonerism will get an actual remaster , so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release . feel free to disagree/ask me anything in the comment . edit : a of recent , i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around . it is essentially the same mix without the volume level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion . drum in particular sound much better . buy the cd and/or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version . great album , problem solved ! the two star still stand though , a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there .
0	i can not imagine why i would order this . my wife must have done this . the song is trite . the lyric are predictable . if you love mope rock , this song is for you !
0	i did not want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase .
1	great song !
0	i love the soundtrack to psycho . it is one of my favorite of all time , so you can imagine how delighted i wa to see this release wa available . i bought it a soon a i saw it and wa excited when it showed up on my doorstep . i put it on my turntable and wa horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality wa . it wa like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs . i could not believe how dreadful it sounded . and absolute insult to bernard herman classic score . so , if you are like me and collect and enjoy listening to soundtrack on vinyl , do yourself a favor and do not make the same mistake i did .
0	just junk
0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer . not much ! he gave it his all when singing with her , but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album . did not sound a though he wa giving it his all ! sorry !
0	great cd , but the person i sent it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it . very disappointing .
0	the worst album i ever purchased wa nevermind . i had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fan recommended it so highly . but i am sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down . it is hard to listen to more than 3 song at one go ! i found the album to be monotonous & boring . the song are very bad and the vocal are awful .
0	i noticed seventy seven people also did not order this and it showed up in their order . not a way to promote a band .
0	only one song on a cd music wonderful i wa looking for more music . at that price offering cd should be full very disappointing
1	i would heard this song for a while on the radio and decided to purchase it . the price wa right so i bought it .
0	very disappointed in this version and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song
0	ordered the wrong one but i listened it it too late to return for an exchange
0	01-06- making memory of us.mp3 could not be imported . the selected file is not valid or is corrupted this is my error message so the file is no good to me . .
0	i heard this song in my church and the band wa great . it wa soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
1	love , love , love this song !
1	they keep getting better and better , every song is talking directly to me ! your side of the bed , listen to the word - amazing !
1	one of the realest rapper in the game right now . j.cole ha never disappointed and this album is no exception . 2014 forest hill dive is his best album to date and best album of 2014 for sure !
1	i will start off by saying that i am one of those completist type . i have to own everything by maybe a certain band , or person . i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes ! , a well a at least 8 other band . i own everything he is done , and i have to admit , this particular album get the most play . you will know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame . he did yikes ! right after coachwhip , and it show . it is extremely thick , reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it is much slower . it is not psychobilly or punk , but extremely loud , thick , heavy drug-induced blue type stuff , with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note . do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes ! album right now . they are quite short , but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer .
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes . i realized that it wasnt him a all ( from the very beginning of it ) . i did not like the song just from the clip i heard . if you ask me , this group or singer sin synthetic , are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame . i almost bought the cd here from amazon . i am so glad that i did not .
1	man i wish i wa on the us missouri when cher wa there getting her sing on
1	how could you go wrong with live zepp at any price !
0	compared to taylor swift cd , this really suck !
1	i have followed lea since she first appeared on glee . she ha a voice that so powerful . and i am happy to see her career continues to climb .
1	a fun and lovely song to sing along to . i bought this version to play in the car for the little one . this is a classic must for child !
1	ahhh ! that sweet voice of anne murray , this lady pours her heart in to all of her song , an extremely pleasing voice for your listening pleasure , buy it youll be glad you did .
0	the recording ha a very low volume . when mixing with other recording , song from this cd are recognizably low in volume , can hardly hear it . good song , bad volume on the cd . anyone know how to turn up the recording volume of mp3s ?
0	this guy is terrific . however , this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content . every song on one is on the other in the exact order . and i bought both thinking they would be different . really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title . great performer . probably a decent guy . but let u take one of those off the market ! it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky .
1	use to deliver morning newspaper listening to this on tape .
1	i love this song and it wasnt available on itunes ! amazon had it and for cheap
0	i loved the song , but it did not download all the way . i can only listen to part of the song .
1	love it
0	the mix on this song is awful , the background noise take over which tell me they are trying to hide a lot of flaw in nias voice . she is from the t.v . show dance mom and should have let abby lee miller produce her song . abby a she doe in everything that she work on put out excellence song for the girl she produce . nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby : a this song is awful , even the title is bad what doe a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life ? the cover is tacky , it look like they used microsoft word to spell nias name in shadow ! bad all the way around . save your money and order kendall vertes song wear em out now that is a great song and you can buy it on amazon for .99 cent . your picture on the cover should have been centered . sorry , nia i am afraid a music career is not for you .
1	great product
0	this is one of my favs from a boy named goo , the cd best known for the goo goo doll breakthrough hit name . this mp3 version of flat top sound horrible - it sound like some of the downloads my sister friend used to get from limewire , where there wa this hissing that sounded like someone wa running a drum stick along the cymbal . i have owned this on cd several time b/c i have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad song on abng , and i am not always in the mood for the downbeat long way down ( trk1 ) . but over the course of owning this cd off and on , i have listened to it many time , this is not the way it is supposed to sound . i listen to this on my desktop pc via my amazon cloud , just like all my other music that i bought in mp3 format and this is not up to bar with anything that cost money . if this were a independent release , i could maybe forgive this mishap . but warner bros./wea is either greedy or stupid . this is inexcusable .
1	i like this song a i know it wa meant for his father tug mcgraw . it is a great song and tim doe a good job singing it but i am not a fan of tims .
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius , but he dumbs it down to country on this release . i do not know if it is pandering or just plain laziness . at any rate it is a disappointment . the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world . musically it is either country waltz or three chord rockabilly . do not waste your money on this one .
1	very good album
1	it is been a while since i have really listened to tegan and sara , but when in heard i could not be your friend i immediately had to buy the album . i am so glad i did because i had forgotten how much i loved them ! i love this album - it is a bit different than what their old stuff wa like , but it is still awesome !
0	could not download it .
1	this is a great song . worth having in your collection . fast and easy download . able to sample before you buy . i love this about amazon

1	great quality . super fast download !
1	i have an original promo copy of this unknown gem - from when it wa released . after year of play , i needed a replacement and i found this pristine copy for a very fair price . it arrived sooner than expected and packaged properly for shipment . thanks to amazon and their affiliate .
0	re-recordings . not the original release .
1	a great song , i love it .
0	did not work , not one song . will not buy here ahain
1	great tribute to richard wright .
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr , and i loved it . it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility , with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal . best track is dig , but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended ; it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape .
0	in the late 1970s there wa a yes-inspired wannabee band called starcastle . starcastle were goodish , they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album , but they were not in the same league with yes . starcastles arrangement were softer , le articulate , and their lyric were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace . you know , star stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist , but what wa the point ? i regret to say this , but fly from here sound like starcastle . it is yes light . i am glad they are still out there , working on new material . but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i posse . this is for one of two listener : either the yes completist , or someone who is not acquainted with yes , but who enjoys light , fluffy , spacey , extended pop . just not a great album imo .
0	i am not normally a fan of remixes , and in this case there is no exception . if you have not bought the original onerepublic album ( dreaming out loud ) that ha this song on it , you are missing out . i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started , but there is no reason for taking credit for someone el song . i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out . i much prefer the original mix to this version .
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample . very good , i enjoyed most every song , except carried by the wind . when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier , a if i would heard it before . i listened a few more time , and yes , i had heard it before . it is a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album ! i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song ! but not only that , farish also inserted the same clip of child laughing that amethystium us in their song avalon from their odonata album . what is up with that ? unless there is good explanation for this copying , the song carried by the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me .
0	clicked on this too quickly before noticing it is not the original .
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
0	it is totaly amazing that this wa created . what make sindel think that horrid classical march will sound better when played ( very badly , i might add ) on electric guitar . the tone he us are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window . this is totaly unlistenable garbage that ha no merrit whatsoever . this might well be the worst cd i have ever bought . i hope this will be the total extent of sindels musical offering . putrid !
0	a great slow song . i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school . i think it came out immediately after if i ever . i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine ! not too long after , i became a freshman in college . music ha always been a great companion of mine . their unison are great . harmony a+ . their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song . it is a classic . they remind me of the guy from the platter , i think that is my grandparent generation .
1	good cd
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this . this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her . this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a a toilet . molly jean wa 19 when this wa recorded . it wa produced by a member of the volebeats , which enticed me to buy it . it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch , occasionally flat , frequently sharp but only about 5 % of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note , even when she writes the song . this music is like the first american idol show of the season where simon laugh at how bad you are and find funny insult . oxycontin denim whore is one of molly original song . not only is she a very poor singer ; she also is not much of a songwriter . she doe a cover of a song called needle in a haystack that i believe wa done by a motown band called the velvelettes . it ha a nice bass line , which is the nicest thing i can find to say about this cd . if you had a cat with their tail in the vacuum cleaner , you might get an idea of the sound . this is an independent release . molly jean ha made her cd . for reason now clear to me , very few have bought it . this is one to avoid at all cost unless you are of a perverse musical nature that delight in the banal . i have not found a cd this dreadful since ramblin jack eliotts & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/the-long-ride/dp/b00000jzau/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > the long ride < /a > ; and this is actually worse than that . molly jean is pretty young girl . i am sure she will find something she can do well . taxi !
1	what an awesome collection of relevant artist on this cd . something fresh to hear and my favorite , bruno mar is featured on one of the track . if you do not want to buy it to support the producer & artist by making the purchase at least take a few minute to listen to the sample . i am guessing you will want to download some of the track to add to your personal collection . many of them are that good .
0	he tried something new , but it did not work .
0	utterly appalling recording .
1	possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie . this soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie . nothing fancy . just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fit perfectly with the time period . a perfect example of how le can be far more effective .
0	aint nothing like 2 crackheads in love brings back memory doe not it remember when they both hooked up cocaine wa indeed a hell of a drug .
1	love it !
1	i like these guy , they kind of blur the line between pop and rock but somehow still come off a being heavy . they just kind of have a nice old-school feel good rock vibe .
0	eh more fluff than substance
1	our first dance a husband and wife wa to this song . i hope we are dancing to it for year to come .
1	this song give me so much inspiration whenever i need it . yolanda adam is one of the most talented and blessed gospel artist today .
0	do not buy this particular version if you are looking for the explicit version . this version is an edited or radio version .
0	this is not the version that you are looking for . have not found the version sung on ondine yet . dang it !
0	rip off , not the song it claim to be . it is someone speaking in another language .
1	exceptional drop of passion resonate with clarity , depth , and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song aint no mountain high enough ; sung with assured perfection by diana ross ; brilliantly written by nickolas ashford & valerie simpson . we soar through the cloud with this flawless rendition . we are lost in it lyrical poetry . we are captured by ross genteel and unique voicing , inflection , and intonation ; she set the stage for listener - in her directness & sincerity . like a soothing wind - le mesure de lamour - her voice capture u anew each time we listen to it . superior backup vocal and orchestration elevate it to it rightful status a a classic . whether we are asleep with this beautiful song secreting itself into our memory or relaxing in our romantic , nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning , enrichment , and theme so present in this joyous , uplifting recording . just send for me , oh baby . remember the day i set you free i told you you could always count on me from that day on , i made a vow , i will be there when you want me , some way , some how . cause baby there aint no mountain high enough , aint no valley low enough , aint no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe . my love is alive way down in my heart although we are mile apart if you ever need a helping hand , i will be there on the double a fast a i can . do not you know that there aint no mountain high enough , aint no valley low enough , aint no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe .
0	i agree with the previous post . these three mix should have been available on the cd version . the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there . it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it is a sin or can you forgive her - the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette form . a cloud in a box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80 flavour . say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there . it is the second-best version of all the remixes .
1	love this song !
0	ok , skeptical a i wa , i gave it a try for a long a i can stand it , and after two semester of daily listening while doing homework and studying , this music ha done nothing for me .
1	i have this song at the head of my classic rock playlist . mr. grey had a great voice , this song ha a happy/upbeat tempo and it serf a a kinda thank you for all the song that follow : give me the beat boy ! just writing this review i need to listen to this again .
0	meh
0	perv .
0	offensive and should not be a part of the free christmas line up . what were you thinking amazon ?
1	love this song , so fun . my 9 and 10 year old love it too . we jam out to it in the van .
1	it omnia enough said : )
1	the legend is back ! best bluegrass ever ! doyle lawson & quicksilver know how bluegrass must be performed ! this album make fun of more from these group .
0	boring
0	how can the album be 9.99 when the 2 track separately are each .99 ? what kind of price gouging is this ?
1	amazing
1	xawesomehave heard this song done a number of way this by far is one of the best
0	we tried two cd and neither played in our 2 stereo . not sure what is wrong with them but we could not get any sound . sad . my 89 year old mom wa excited
1	great song ! i have always liked crow , so that is no surprise . you would think ! but believe me , i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k-pax . it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year . the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely . the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man , a classic . unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack . it is just the score . so look elsewhere for this great song ! trust me , you will not be disappointed .
1	love it !
0	not a fan . skip this song each time .
1	pretty good album . love the option to download and get cd for almost the same price
0	pre ordered it and when the album wa released i only got 4 song in stead of all of them on the album release date
1	this is the music from the opening scene of the movie , layer cake , wherein daniel craig play a fascinating , vulnerable role a a middle man for a recreational medication group in the uk . interesting concept for a movie , and the music grab your attention , also .
1	remembered this song from year ago and am very glad to have found it again .
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you . i would definately recommend this to anyone ( even if they are not a big fan of classical music ) .
0	this chick is ridiculous , she sound like a britney spear on crack . there is absolutely no talent on this bitch .
0	not the same singer that did the original hit like secret lover and always .
0	it kept me in shape reaching for the next tune button . the dodo have 2 song that i listened to all the way to the end , all the rest were just too pathetic .
1	little and ashley harmonize very well in this recording . the lyric bring vision of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bell . who doe not like sleigh bell ? i like it !
0	this track doe not work ! played once and that wa it ! gave one star because i received a prompt refund . hope this help .
0	i have a vynil copy of that album , and will not buy the cd , cause there are much better option to waste money ! zipper is a strange album of an artist that wa a great star during the early-mid 70 , but during the disco and the new wave , turned to be irrelevant . his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experience to make a come-back , but he had to wait few more year . zipper reminds u sometimes the classic alice of love it to death , school out etc. , but it is far from being on the same level .
1	i love this song . it is exactly the same a what i had heard from the dvd . great quality sound . i stored the sound in my amazon cloud .
0	a much a i can scream out expletive about the grrrrrreatness of qaf the show , the soundtrack fall sadly mediocre . it tout itself a almost like being in babylon ( a dancejoint that doe not exist in real life ) , well i guess it doe in a way , but it doe not capture the whole feel of babylon . i wa expecting remixes and stuff ! where is it ? on the whole i guess it an o.k . compilation . a lot of you will not really get what i am saying but , that is okay too . the british soundtrack is actually better .
0	i wa very disappointed in the speed sleep product . it seemed to go on and on . the music wa very annoying . once you buy it you are stuck with it . it is nothing more than a relaxation session . just relax your body , think calm thought , and save your money .
1	great song to work out to ! love it . inspiring !
1	mr. sandman is one of the few song i can sing with gusto . of course i cange the word him to her but it work .
1	this is awesome ! i pop this cd in around thanksgiving and it basically play until january ! josh did an outstanding job . i love his version of the classic christmas song , especially little drummer boy . every track is great , in my opinion , however i am not to keen on the first noel . mainly because i am not a fan of faith hill voice and i am not convinced that their voice harmonize well together . again , that is just my opinion . i would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone . i love it so much and i hope many others will also !
1	well , memory , ha a special place in the heart of my sweetheart , and betty buckley simply doe it best !
0	i like to think internally .
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music . it just suck really bad and ha no love in it .
0	not a good a i hoped it would be
1	i love these techno version . dj doomsday , please make more of these song . god bless you . now i can dance and worship at the same time .
1	both song featured on this one were very good . the instrumental version were nice addition a well . the last track is a talk segment , which is why this is 4 star .
0	not the best stuff from either artist
0	you would think that this is the exact same track from the paperman short , but you would be wrong . it is missing the electric guitar that come in at 5:15 during the actual video . meaning it is meant to be present around the 3:40 mark for the mp3 . for me , this omission ruin the entire track . disappointed .
1	we all listen to different music ( classical , country , heavy metal , blue , rap , pop , folk . ) so it is rare when we like the same band . this is the band . this is album is wonderful . not a stinker in the lot = )
0	probably the worst excuse i have heard for a musical . no actual music or story and the lyric are just juvenile at best . doe not give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art .
1	promise made on signal mountain ha to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . this entire cd is so calming ; i can not explain the sense of peace that come over me when i listen to it . if you are looking for something relaxing and uplifting , i would highly recommend it !
1	love it
0	not a relaxing music a i though it would be .
1	beautiful album
0	not listenable . you are better off just donating to get nothing in return .
1	love this song so much . reminds u to pray , give it to god , move on and trust ! great song of encouragement !
0	far too sappy . vastly overproduced . where is the rawness and fire of the earlier day ? a tremendous dissapointment . the only good thing about it is i do not own it . a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic . boy did i ever get the short end .
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
1	a far a i am concerned there is no other choir that can stand up to this one . i you have ever never heard the star spanged banner sung by them it would be well worth your time to find it . p.s . i am not a mormon .
1	this is grammy award material .
1	this is a great 1957 session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson . a fine clollection of bebop & ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant + eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum . from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha-cha , this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat . once again , great & rare music like this is only available a an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith : eighteen classic albums-which i purchased for about $ 20 . i am so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic session of jazz available & affordable for those who like timeless music such a this one by jos & papa lou-who still today blow circle around those much younger & more acclaimed ( by the critics/experts ) than he .
1	a landmark album .
0	i love terrance and his acting is superb . he just can not sing but he can really play the guitar . i paid 13.00 for the cd and there were only 2 song i played a little . i enjoyed the spanish type song . maybe if he wa able to sing more soulful . anyway do not pay the cd , but i love you terrance you are one of my fav actor .
1	love this cd .
1	excellent
0	not traditional music , very synthesized new native music - not what i wa expecting .
0	a big disappointment . purchased based on the high praise it received in a recent aarp magazine publication .
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album . it made a very poor impression then , but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later . this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired : ray manzareks unique , soulful , creative keyboard rendition , robby kriegers classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability , and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band . what i expected from these guy , particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death - from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity - wa an impressive , soul-chilling outpouring of creative spirit . robbie krieger , after all , wrote some of the door most popular piece , and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable , he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song . i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian - if not in ray vocal , at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song . this is what i expected . what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender . instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul , their lyric , and melody sounded astonishingly , mind-blowingly , banal - lacking even the faintest trace of the rich , subversive , haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best . even their song title practically scream low-brow mediocrity ( i am horny , i am stoned ? seriously ? ) listening to this album , i can not believe anyone , not knowing who these guy were , would recognize anything doorsian about them . despite appearance , this review is not about bashing the surviving member of the door ; they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man - and still do - to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude . for me this is about solving a mystery : how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit ? my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well-beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal . i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity ( he may also have imposed a clearly much-needed discipline , by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric ) . something about morrison , i think , drew out the best in krieger , manzarek , and densmore . and perhaps morrison simply would not accept anything but the best from his bandmates . perhaps more than anything , he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically - a fertile world where their musicality could flourish . i have little doubt that if you placed a young , hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result . i believe the post-morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic , a pretty face , goosebump-producing voice , and even a songwriter : he wa a primal , creative force - a dionysus to his bandmate maenad . with him , they were a holy , orgiastic force ; without him , they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest .
0	this wa a gift for my daughter for christmas , so i can not review this item
1	this song is the reason that we , in the u , know who adele is . great lyric , great music , great adele .
0	this is him singing a a younger artist . still have not been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song . still an awesome and tear jerking song though .

1	good sound quality and memory ! love journey song .
0	what can i say ? it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album . apparently , there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here . what complete jibberish . how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release ? while i would love to say i am shocked mr. taylor would sanction this , it is apparently one of the many new , le than desirable trend the record company have espoused lately to get those few of u left who support physical medium to shell out more dough . disgusting .
1	this is one of the best new band out there at the moment and this album and song are a must have !
1	when i bought this cd , i did not know what track were on it . so i am listing the track . this is a live album , but do not know if it is recorded at once , since it stop between track . cd1 1 foxey lady 4:50 2 i do not live today 5:29 3 red house 10:49 4 spanish castle magic 11:26 5 star-spangled banner 2:23 6 the wind cry mary 3:41 7 burning of the midnight lamp 3:48 8 fire 2:47 cd2 1 purple haze 5:51 2 voodoo child ( a slight return ) 9:15 3 sunshine of your love 4:14 4 voodoo child ( reprise ) 3:23 5 catfish blue 7:43 6 killing floor 5:07 7 can you please crawl out your window 3:02 8 hey joe 6:12 the cd ha no booklet , so there is no information about when or where this live album wa recorded . i am not a die-hard hendrix fan so i would not know if these were previously released or not , by just listening to them . the quality of the music doe sound a little bit unusual , like if i wa listening to a cassette that is been played too much , not your usual cd clarity . but maybe this is common of live recording , i do not know , or if the music is bootleg or whatever . or maybe it is my cd player fault . but i bought this cd at 1 cent price , so overall i am pleased with this purchase because jimi hendrix is a good artist .
1	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a great catchy rhythm . you may have heard it is cover in pitch perfect .
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one . very short a little over a minute . buyer should be notified . have never seen such a short rendition and be charged more like a sample .
1	this might be the best product big bad voodoo daddy ha ever released . every song is fantastic . in this cd they mixed new orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that , though it is clearly big bad voodoo daddy , give it a fresh sound . the lyric are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful . in addition , the duet it only took a kiss is gorgeous . i had vision of fred astaire and ginger rogers dancing during it .
0	the tape will not play . it drag . ive tried other tape in the same player and have no problem .
0	i am confused a to how to listen to this track . where do i go ? my review ha nothing to do about rihanna , she is great and i love this song . that is why i bought it ! i wa just disappointed when i went to listen to the song and i had no idea where to go . why can not it just download straight to itunes ? it would have been so much easier !
0	racist
0	i did not enjoy this album a much a the previous album .
0	where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyric go ? while the music may have at least attempted to go back to from here to infirmary it is stopped dead by skibas voice and lyric , such a on draculina and the american scream . his raw passionate word have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocal and now song just seem awkward when he decides to throw the f word into them ( eating me alive ) . dan manages to save some of the album with off the map and fine , but once again , they lyric are sub par . do not get me wrong , i do not hate the trio , they are my favorite band , but they could do so much better than this . i wanted to like it , and went into it with an open mind , but after a few listens , nothing stuck out , and i did not even feel the need to listen to it ever again . if you really want a good alkaline trio record go pick up & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/good-mourning/dp/b00008yjda/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > good mourning < /a > & nbsp ; and anything before it . if you have listened to this one and like it , go try out & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/from-here-to-infirmary/dp/b00005b2xu/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > from here to infirmary < /a > & nbsp ; or & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/goddamnit/dp/b0012gm69y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > goddamnit < /a > & nbsp ; i promise they are so much better .
1	great
0	uggg , another christmas cd from leann rime . you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice . it is sad to watch all her project fail and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album . people put out christmas music when their career are failing . leann used to have a great voice and wa a likable talent . not anymore . i can not understand the word she is singing and the album is not very good . i used to be a big fan but she seems so unaware of what she ha done to her career lately . too bad . career over .
1	i love this song . i sing it all day every dayyy !
1	a great follow-up to her award winning duet with jason aldean and her tv show duet , kelly sings with famed country artist vince gill to create a truly lovely song . it is well sung and it keep running through my head . it is one of those hear it one time and know you will buy it song imho . enjoy !
0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now-wife laurie anderson . both are outstanding artist and musician . i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album . it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone . lou reed play electric guitar , laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone . the producer obviously told everybody to improvise . if you have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect . the result is essentially white noise - unlistenable . definitely for completists only . and do not bother to pay the elevated price from dealer here . a short internet search will reveal that it is still available from the stone webshop . this limited edition will take some time to sell out .
1	i absolutely love this album . i play it constantly . these song are just perfect .
1	this concept and music/dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever ! the music is phenominal ( who would have expected le ? ) and the live/acoustic and cd/dvd package is an off the chart idea . in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver , hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way !
1	sarah mclachlan ha such a beautiful voice . make it sound a if an angel is singing the song . one of many tremendous song released by sarah mclachlan .
1	the cd arrived on time and in good condition . the music is loud clear and good recording quality ! i will be ordering more dick jonas music !
1	prince . wa . one . of . the . greatest . of . all . time . and . i. love . his . music
1	brilliant ! i have not seen the show ( hope to , some day ) but the music alone is phenomenonal !
0	i had to pay to listen to this song even tho i am a prime member and it is prime music !
0	i could not download this . i tried multiple time and reading all of the help info did not help ! very disappointed
0	all 4 side were completely scratched and the record would skip every other note
1	i fell in love with this song on ghost ship . i had to do some research to find the actual song , a it is not on the album , but i am glad i found it . it is so pretty , and the singer ha a beautiful voice .
1	great item , just what i needed .
1	the used cd came from library-by the-lake , and wa exactly a discribed . it wa in perfect condition and arrived quickly , without damage . the life action singer produce great music and this cd is one of their best .
1	beautifully sung by howard shore ! a great buy .
0	i downloaded this on accident . gave it a listen and turned it off . saw the video and almost threw up in my mouth . this is not hiphop . probably some kind of wierd rap music
0	i wa very excited for this album to come out . i have been a fan of river and the =w= since childhood . i am only on my first day of listening , but am in shock at the quality . big hype over this album and all it is is random , jammy song put into an album . plus i have heard half of these song in the past with the same quality or better . not too impressed . but i will always purchase weezer related album for support , but after the green album , make believe , and now this . i am a bit turned off . lover in the snow , blast off , & who you callin bitch are the only worthy song . again , i have heard these before this album . go buy the blue deluxe album . it is a way better buy !
1	great song !
1	i just finished watching philadelphia . the movie-one of the most moving ( and sad ) movie i have ever seen . not a dry eye in the house with this one ! the song ( neil young ) - perhaps one of the most beautiful and pensive love song i have ever heard . i want to own that song ( not necessarily the entire soundtrack ) .
1	one of my favorite contemporary christian artist . the song and lyric stir my spirit and uplift my soul . i always feel rejuvenated and inspired after listening .
1	who would not like jb ? he is excellent- what is priceless ? amazon prime- gave a whole of his music free .
0	on this cd you will only find side a of the original album skin diver suite , side b is not included . too bad . plus : it is taken from vinyl , not from the mastertape . i guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip .
0	condition wa stated acceptable . hardly listenable .
