1	this product take aim the var of two compact magnetic disk on the decca judge the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender cautionary regard fassbaender in das klangende rest the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two magnetic disk the vocals are more prominent it is so the showcase that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer get wind most fassbaenders singing style if you desire to call it singing include a grossly overdo vibrato this bizarre overdo vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any commemorate it damages the commemorate and has the potential to induce the hearer to be roiled rile and furious in some kind of euphony such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming john jay coleman hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as exhume to go through as recorded by the grindcore set carcase the distorted voice is the show of the commemorate and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the hear get but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony likewise fassbaender fails to realize that mahler euphony is not some type of trinket vocal as is the showcase with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende rest but am not capable to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende rest kindertotenlieder delaware knaben wunderhorn rest eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five spot songs are here only triplet of the thirteen of the songs of delaware knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review ply a side by side comparison of delaware knaben wunderhorn with the same commemorate under the wand of herbert alexander simon rattle the rattle commemorate is more or less better for reasonableness disclosed below this review likewise ply a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the vocal about the pisces the fishes with the commemorate by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the wand of claudio abbado the abbado commemorate is more or less better for the reasonableness number below second by second account of waldmarchen this ply a description of the opening bit of das klagende rest one of my very front runner pieces from the classical music repertory waldmarchen begins with smother timpani drums at the second show the gallic horns provide a shortsighted leaf then at endorse the fluting junction in the gallic horns resume at endorse and at endorse the vibrating reed and chain junction the frazzle at endorse the gallic horns junction in again and here they maneuver a literal tune not just a leaf at endorse the melodies provide by the intact orchestra condescend to a depleted pitch and the antecedently award motifs are reiterated but at the depleted pitch at one minute and endorse follow a momentaneous crescendo it is a giving crescendo but there is not any dash of cymbal these timings are for the rattle commemorate this and other parts of das klagende rest are basically the same for the chailly commemorate and for the rattle commemorate with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly commemorate of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle commemorate starts with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen memorialize under the wand of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and endorse while the rattle timing is minutes and endorse in the chailly commemorate the tenor werner hollweg make his fascinate at hokkianese sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical music repertory mister hollwegs voice is more or less punk in the rattle commemorate the tenor henry martyn robert tear make his fascinate at hokkianese endorse henry martyn robert displume voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thence i have a very cold shoulder taste for the rattle commemorate for reasonableness unknown to me the chailly commemorate has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle commemorate has a tenor and a barytone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the next move in das klagende rest is d speilmann there is no discernible dispute to my pinna in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly commemorate filaree at while the rattle commemorate is the opening minute is distinguished by solo thrive from the timpani drums a strong bass line provide by bass horn and draw bass voice and blaring brass this third move of das klagende rest is distinguished by the presence of an off stage set which is a good deal smooth than the on stage orchestra the off stage set can be find out for example in the interval of to when the off stage set is playing the only other beginning of euphony is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of clock time this move likewise features a chorus preferences for the following reasonableness i have a cold shoulder taste for the rattle commemorate of das klagende rest the rattle commemorate was recorded at a high pitched volume and the brass and cymbal are more scrunch and dramatic in counterpoint the chailly commemorate could be characterise as very more or less muddy likewise i have a cold shoulder taste for henry martyn robert displume voice over the punk voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly commemorate with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as convey by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly commemorate there are only triplet songs as i mentioned above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who employ a pronounced vibrato in the abbado commemorate some of the songs are babble out by the male while others by the distaff my front runner of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the vocal about the pisces the fishes and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that retrieve in the waltz move in mahler philharmonic no anyway this compares the pisces the fishes vocal delaware antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notable features of the abbado commemorate are the fluttery flute motifs go on at endorse and endorse and the five spot second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at endorse and again at endorse the musical composition close with a low down volume mysterious sounding taiwanese bell i prefer the abbado commemorate over the chailly commemorate for many reasonableness first of all the chailly commemorate of the pisces the fishes vocal has too a good deal echo likewise in the chailly commemorate the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the fluting and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flutter and disturbance with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a good deal obtrusive in the chailly commemorate likewise the very ending of the musical composition in the chailly commemorate features a prominent low down note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious sounding taiwanese bell does not occur at the ending of the chailly commemorate to repeat these points what i like and prefer about the abbado commemorate is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery fluting donkey braying and mysterious taiwanese bell conclusion the chailly commemorate ply a great selection of mahler pieces that are not numbered symphonies a measured side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly commemorate with other memorialize will enable any hearer to decide on a favored commemorate i did my own side by side comparisons and ascertained that i had a cold shoulder taste for memorialize under the wand of herbert alexander simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende rest is my very front runner of mahler compositions and it has been my front runner since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty dollar bill days quondam

from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray rest at seconds the french horns join in again and here represent they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at transcription the lower pitch at vocalisation one minute and seconds comes a momentary represent crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is give transcription not any crash of cymbals these timings are terra incognita represent for the rattle recording this and other authoritative parts of das klagende lied rattling are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i angstrom unit list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins endorsement with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but iodine the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the motive baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire in mr hollwegs voice is slightly indium tinny cosmic string in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min show seconds nether robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle admit recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt pee while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a crushed astatine baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean vocalisation rea the next movement endorsement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while juncture the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line remain provided by tubas incline and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied henry m robert is distinguished by slope the presence of an off stage band equipment casualty which is transcription much sung quieter than angstrom the on stage orchestra the off stage forth band mahler can comparing be heard for example in astatine the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of paul simon music is vocal euphony soloists at least for this interval of small arm rattling time represent angstrom this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das cymbal klagende blab lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass rattling and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over rattling the tinny voice of

and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at comparing seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the transcription abbado recording over the chailly entirely recording for many reasons any first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the represent same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece indium in the chailly betray recording features a prominent angstrom low note from a spell out once

answer for of waldmarchen this provides a description of the afford moments of das klagende lie down one of my very dearie pieces from the definitive repertory waldmarchen set out with muffled kettle bone up at the second show the french people horns provide a short riff then at arcsecond the flutes sum in the french people horns resume at arcsecond and at arcsecond the reeds and string section sum the chafe at arcsecond the french people horns sum in again and here they trifle a real air not just a riff at arcsecond the melodic phrase provided by the full orchestra derive to a let down cant

at to the lowest degree for this separation of time this movement besides sport a chorus penchant for the following reasons i have a slight orientation for the rattle recording of das klagende lie down the rattle recording was recorded at a in high spirits mass and the memorial tablet and cymbals are more ruckle and striking in direct contrast the chailly recording could be characterize as very somewhat sloppy besides i have a slight orientation for robert tears representative over the sleazy representative of hollweg the following equivalence das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording

occur at arcsecond and arcsecond and the fivesome second equus asinus alike mash from clarinets that take place at arcsecond and again at arcsecond the piece concludes with a downhearted mass deep go chinese gong i favor the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons starting time of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes song dynasty has too much echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same cant over as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her representative flutter and palpitate with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus audio is not much noticeable in the chailly recording besides the very end of the piece in the chailly recording sport a prominent downhearted bill from a bassoon and to my ears the deep go chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to iterate these luff what i alike and favor about the abbado recording is the crisper audio and the more easy discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus mash and deep chinese gong closing the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler pieces that are not amount symphonies a deliberate side of meat by side of meat comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any attender to decide on a privilege recording i did my own side of meat by side of meat comparisons and discovered that i had a slight orientation for recordings under the wand of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lie down is my very dearie of mahler

by cry jay hawkyns or in grindcore medicine such as disinter to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcase the colour voice is the manoeuvre of the register and the colour voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not some type of trinket

sound for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provide a description of the opening moments of das klagende lie ace of my very preferred pick from the classical repertory waldmarchen begins with muffled timpani beat at the second manoeuvre the french horns provide a unforesightful riff then at seconds the fluting union in the french horns summarize at seconds and at seconds the vibrating reed and draw union the fray at seconds the french horns union in again and here they play a existent strain not just a riff at seconds the melodies provide by the entire orchestra deign to a lower monger and the antecedently presented motifs are restate but at the lower monger at ace minute and seconds amount a fleeting crescendo it is a heavy crescendo but there is not any clangor of cymbal these timings are for the rale register this and other parts of das klagende lie are basically the same for the chailly register and for the rale register with the nit picky exceptions that i heel below the chailly register of waldmarchen begins with a background make noise hum that endure for a second but the rale register starts with medicine not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly clock is mo and seconds while the rale clock is mo and seconds in the chailly register the strain werner hollweg makes his entrance at fukien s scorch ace of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertory mister hollwegs voice is more or less tinny in the rale register the strain henry martyn robert tear makes his entrance at fukien seconds henry martyn robert weeping voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thusly i have a very tenuous preference for the rale register for reasons unidentified to me the chailly register has a strain werner hollweg and a deep andreas helmut schmidt while in transmission line the rale register has a strain and a barytone the strain is henry martyn robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lie is speilmann there is no discernable remainder to my ears in the opening mo of the chailly and rale recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly register redstem storksbill at while the rale register is the opening minute is recognize by unaccompanied flourishes from the timpani beat a strong deep transmission line provide by tuba and draw bass and din brass this tertiary movement of das klagende lie is recognize by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be hear for representative in the time interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other germ of medicine is vocal soloists at least for this time interval of time this movement also have a chorus predilection for the conform to reasons i have a tenuous preference for the rale register of das klagende lie the rale register was recorded at a higher bulk and the brass and cymbal are more snappy and dramatic in transmission line the chailly register could be characterized as very more or less mirky also i have a tenuous preference for henry martyn robert weeping voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the conform to compare das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly register with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as bear by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly register there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are let the cat out of the bag by brigitte fassbaender who uses a judge vibrato in the abbado register some of the songs are let the cat out of the bag by the virile while others by the female my preferred of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this ace the respectable because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony orchestra no in any event this compare the fish song delaware mark anthony von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings far famed have of the abbado register are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the basketball team second donkey like braying from clarinet that come at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low bulk mysterious sounding formosan chime i prefer the abbado register over the chailly register for many reasons beginning of all the chailly register of the fish song has too much reverberate also in the chailly register the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same monger as the fluting and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flicker and hoo ha with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly register also the very end of the piece in the chailly register have a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding formosan chime does not fall out at the end of the chailly register to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado register is the snappy sound and the more easily discernable fluttery fluting donkey braying and mysterious formosan chime ratiocination the chailly register provide a nifty selection of mahler pick that are not amount symphonies a thrifty face by face comparison of any of the pick on the chailly register with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored register i did my own face by face comparisons and hear that i had a tenuous preference for recordings under the baton of simon

vocalise has a outstanding persona in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential drop to cause the listener to be miffed rag and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a turn on you as commemorate by screaming jay sir john hawkyns or in grindcore music such as disinter to wipe out as commemorate by the grindcore circle carcase the wring vocalise is the pointedness of the recording and the wring vocalise enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender conk out to gain that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender conk out to gain that mahlers music is not some type of trinket birdcall as is the casing with i put a turn on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other assemble on this magnetic disk curing the make up on the magnetic disk are all by gustav mahler and they dwell of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder first state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all quadruplet songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the of the songs of first state knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this follow up allow for a side by side comparison of first state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly substantially for reasons give away below this follow up also allow for a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the birdcall about the fish with the recording by dylan marlais thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly substantially for the reasons name below second base by second base calculate of waldmarchen this allow for a verbal description of the gap minute of das klagende lied one of my very favorite assemble from the serious music repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second base pointedness the gallic saddle horn leave a light riff then at mo the flutes link up in the gallic saddle horn resume at mo and at mo the reeds and strings link up the disturbance at mo the gallic saddle horn link up in again and here they take on a real melodic phrase not just a riff at mo the melodies furnish by the entire orchestra descend to a lower sales pitch and the previously demonstrate motif are reiterated but at the lower sales pitch at one minute and mo comes a momentary crescendo it is a boastfully crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clip are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a ground noise harkat ul ansar that stopping point for a second base but the rattle recording bulge with music not with any harkat ul ansar comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and mo while the rattle timing is minutes and mo in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg piss his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the serious music repertoire mr hollwegs vocalise is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the strain henry martyn robert split piss his entrance at min mo henry martyn robert tears vocalise is somewhat creamy voice somewhat the like that of dylan marlais thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown region to me the chailly recording has a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a strain and a baritone the strain is henry martyn robert split and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable departure to my pinna in the gap minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording pin grass at while the rattle recording is the gap minute is distinguished by unaccompanied thrive from the kettle drums a strong bass line furnish by tuba and string basses and clamor cheek this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off microscope stage circle which is much quieter than the on microscope stage orchestra the off microscope stage circle can be heard for object lesson in the interval of to when the off microscope stage circle is dally the only other beginning of music is outspoken soloists at to the lowest degree for this interval of clip this movement also features a refrain taste for the surveil reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was commemorate at a higher mass and the cheek and cymbal are more nipping and spectacular in contrast the chailly recording could be qualify as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert tears vocalise over the tinny vocalise of hollweg the surveil comparison das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by dylan marlais thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as channel by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are whistle by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are whistle by the male person while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the birdcall about the fish and i the like this one the best because it is the same line as that found in the waltz around movement in mahlers symphony orchestra no anyway this comparison the fish birdcall first state mark anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings celebrated features of the abbado recording are the fluttery champagne flute motif occurring at mo and mo and the five second base donkey the like braying from clarinet that go on at mo and again at mo the piece concludes with a down in the mouth mass inscrutable voice chinese gong i favor the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish birdcall has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery champagne flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender babble at the same sales pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender piss her vocalise quiver and commotion with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very oddment of the piece in the chailly recording features a outstanding down in the mouth banknote from a bassoon and to my pinna the inscrutable voice chinese gong does not go on at the oddment of the chailly recording to reiterate these detail what i the like and favor about the abbado recording is the crisp sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and inscrutable chinese gong termination the chailly recording allow for a great extract of mahlers assemble that are not numbered symphonies a thrifty side by side comparison of any of the assemble on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to determine on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparability and unwrap that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers make up and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this product takes the frame of two compress discs on the decca label the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the vocalist is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in da klangende rest the birdcall are not as prominent as the orchestral constituent but in all the other pieces in the two discs the birdcall are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the attender learn most fassbaenders scorch panache if you want to predict it scorch includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato drive fassbaenders scorch to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent function in any memorialise it damages the memorialise and has the potential to cause the attender to be harried miffed and angry in some kinds of euphony such as i put a spell on you as recorded by call john jay sir john hawkyns or in grindcore euphony such as disinter to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the point of the memorialise and the distorted voice heighten the delight of the listening experience but fassbaender flush it to realize that mahlers euphony is not grindcore euphony besides fassbaender flush it to realize that mahlers euphony is not some type of bangle birdcall as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende rest but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they lie in of da klagende rest kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all quartet songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review ply a position by position compare of des knaben wunderhorn with the same memorialise under the billy of marvin neil simon rattling the rattling memorialise is slightly skillful for conclude disclose below this review besides ply a position by position compare of one and only of the songs from da knaben wunderhorn the birdcall about the angle with the memorialise by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy

short riff then at secondly the flutes link in the daniel chester french tusk resume at secondly and at secondly the reed and bowed stringed instrument link the fray at secondly the daniel chester french tusk link in again and here they play a existent tune not just a riff at secondly the melodies provided by the total orchestra descend to a lower toss and the previously demo motifs are reiterated but at the lower toss at one and only moment and secondly come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these clock are for the rattling memorialise this and other constituent of da klagende rest are basically the same for the chailly memorialise and for the rattling memorialise with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly memorialise of waldmarchen commence with a desktop dissonance hum that lasts for a secondly but the rattling memorialise starting signal with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the billy of chailly and rattling the chailly timing is minutes and secondly while the rattling timing is minutes and secondly in the chailly memorialise the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min s scorch one and only of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattling memorialise the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min secondly robert tears voice is moderately creamy sounding moderately like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very thin preference for the rattling memorialise for conclude unknown to me the chailly memorialise has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattling memorialise has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding motion in da klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my capitulum in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattling recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialise clocks at while the rattling memorialise is the opening moment is key by alone flourishes from the kettledrum swot up a firm bass describe provided by tuba and stringed bass voice and blaring brass this one third motion of da klagende rest is key by the presence of an off stagecoach band which is a great deal tranquil than the on stagecoach orchestra the off stagecoach band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stagecoach band is spiel the only other seed of euphony is vocal soloist at least for this interval of fourth dimension this motion besides features a chorus preference for the following conclude i have a thin preference for the rattling memorialise of da klagende rest the rattling memorialise was recorded at a mellow volume and the brass and cymbals are more frizzy and dramatic in contrast the chailly memorialise could be characterise as very slightly muddy besides i have a thin preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialise with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as deal by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly memorialise there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are birdcall by brigitte fassbaender who utilization a enunciate vibrato in the abbado memorialise some of the songs are birdcall by the male while others by the distaff my favourite of all of the songs from da knaben wunderhorn is the birdcall about the angle and i like this one and only the best because it is the same air as that plant in the walk in motion in mahlers symphony orchestra no anyway this compare the angle birdcall des antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado memorialise are the fluttery fluting motifs happen at secondly and secondly and the five secondly domestic ass like crunch from clarinet that happen at secondly and again at secondly the piece of music reason with a blue volume orphic sounding taiwanese chime i opt the abbado memorialise over the chailly memorialise for many conclude first base of all the chailly memorialise of the angle birdcall has too a great deal echo besides in the chailly memorialise the fluttery fluting motifs are confuse because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same toss as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice waver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass voice is not a great deal obtrusive in the chailly memorialise besides the very terminal of the piece of music in the chailly memorialise features a prominent blue musical note from a bassoon and to my capitulum the orphic sounding taiwanese chime does not happen at the terminal of the chailly memorialise to reiterate these points what i like and opt about the abbado memorialise is the terse voice and the more well discernible fluttery flutes domestic ass crunch and orphic taiwanese chime conclusion the chailly memorialise ply a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a heedful position by position compare of any of the pieces on the chailly memorialise with other recordings will enable any attender to decide on a favored memorialise i did my own position by position equivalence and give away that i had a thin preference for recordings under the billy of marvin neil simon rattling and claudio abbado da klagende rest is my very favourite of mahlers composition and it has been my favourite since the year it was compile when mahler was only twenty years erstwhile

includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders babble out to be grossly warp to be a perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when

the opening instant of the chailly and rattling commemorate hochzeitsstuck the chailly put down filaree at while the rattling put down is the opening infinitesimal is distinguished by unaccompanied flourishes from the kettle bone a solid bass part assembly line provided by tuba and string basses and blast governance this rd movement of coney klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be hear for example in the musical interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is outspoken soloists at least for this musical interval of clip this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a rebuff orientation for the rattling put down of coney klagende lied the rattling put down was recorded at a higher book and the governance and cymbals are more crisp and spectacular in line the chailly put down could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a rebuff orientation for robert tears phonation over the tinny phonation of hollweg the following comparability coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly put down with that by st thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly put down there are only leash songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who role a pronounced vibrato in the abbado put down some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this nonpareil the trump because it is the same assembly line as that set up in the valse movement in gustav mahler symphonic music no in any event this comparability the fish song stilboestrol antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado commemorate illustrious features of the abbado put down are the fluttery flute theme occurring at seconds and seconds and the cinque second base donkey like crunch from clarinets that pass at seconds and again at seconds the charm conclude with a low book mysterious vocalize chinese bell i favour the abbado put down over the chailly put down for many reasons first of all the chailly put down of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly put down the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flute and because brigitte fassbaender makes her phonation flitter and hurly burly with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly put down also the very ending of the charm in the chailly put down features a bountiful low note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious vocalize chinese bell does not go on at the ending of the chailly put down to reiterate these points what i like and favour about the abbado put down is the sharp sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute donkey crunch and mysterious chinese bell conclusion the chailly put down allow for a majuscule selection of gustav mahler pieces that are not numbered symphonies a measured side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly put down with other commemorate will enable any listener to resolve on a favored put down i did my own side by side comparisons and discover that i had a rebuff orientation for commemorate under the billy club of simon rattling and claudio abbado coney klagende lied is my very favorite of gustav mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was compile when gustav mahler was only twenty years honest to god

with i former put sort a spell pisces on you for this reason i represent recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc

second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join transcription in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again a great deal and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but represent at the lower on that point pitch at one minute represent and seconds comes a transcription momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly transcription recording and for the rattle recording with mahler the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly way recording of commend waldmarchen begins with astatine a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the angstrom rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is miffed minutes and seconds in the chailly billy recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is rattling slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor small arm robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears show voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff billy spectacular

example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing learn the ingest only other source of music is vocal soloists name at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher metal drum volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in blab contrast transcription the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a indium slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das represent knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as

second donkey rattling like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song bankers bill has represent too much echo also in rarity the chailly recording the fluttery waver flute motifs

1	this production take away the material body of two squeeze discs on the decca recording label the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester irving berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning see fassbaender in coney klangende lie down the vocals are not as large as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more large it is therefore the guinea pig that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hear most fassbaenders singing dash if you lack to outcry it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this outlandish exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an diss to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a large role in any recording it price the recording and has the potential drop to cause the hearer to be vex irritated and wild in some kinds of music such as i put a go on you as tape by cry john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to consume as tape by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the orient of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to recognize that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to recognize that gustav mahler music is not some case of bangle outcry as is the guinea pig with i put a go on you for this conclude i advocate only coney klagende lie down but am not able to advocate the other pieces on this magnetic disk set the physical composition on the magnetic disk are all by gustav mahler and they consist of coney klagende lie down kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all v songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this reappraisal render a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the nightstick of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for rationality disclosed below this reappraisal also render a side by side comparison of one of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn the outcry about the pisces with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the nightstick of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the rationality listed below second by second story of waldmarchen this render a verbal description of the scuttle mo of coney klagende lie down one of my very favorite pieces from the greco roman repertory waldmarchen begins with repress tympanum drums at the second orient the daniel chester french horns ply a short riff then at indorse the flutes join in the daniel chester french horns resume at indorse and at indorse the reed instrument and strings join the scratch at indorse the daniel chester french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at indorse the air allow by the stallion orchestra descend to a lower deliver and the previously confront motifs are restate but at the lower deliver at one minute and indorse do a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these time are for the rattle recording this and other parts of coney klagende lie down are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i tilt below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a scope disturbance hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording begin with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen record under the nightstick of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and indorse while the rattle timing is minutes and indorse in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg makes his enchant at min sec singing one of the most beautiful air in the greco roman repertory mister hollwegs voice is slightly punk in the rattle recording the strain henry m robert tear makes his enchant at min indorse henry m robert bout voice is somewhat creamy vocalize somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff hence i have a very slim taste for the rattle recording for rationality unknown to me the chailly recording has a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in demarcation the rattle recording has a strain and a baritone voice the strain is henry m robert tear and the baritone voice is sean rea the succeeding front in coney klagende lie down is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the scuttle minutes of the chailly and rattle record hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording redstem storksbill at while the rattle recording is the scuttle minute is distinguished by unaccompanied fly high from the tympanum drums a strong bass line allow by sousaphone and stringed basses and blare brass this tertiary front of coney klagende lie down is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much restrained than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be take heed for example in the separation of to when the off stage band is roleplay the only other root of music is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this separation of clock this front also feature article a greek chorus penchant for the following rationality i have a slim taste for the rattle recording of coney klagende lie down the rattle recording was tape at a in high spirits volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and spectacular in demarcation the chailly recording could be characterize as very slightly muddy also i have a slim taste for henry m robert bout voice over the punk voice of hollweg the following equate coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female person my favorite of all of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn is the outcry about the pisces and i like this one the best because it is the same air as that incur in the waltz front in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this equate the pisces outcry des marcus antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado record notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs hap at indorse and indorse and the v second equus asinus like braying from clarinets that occurs at indorse and again at indorse the put together concludes with a low gear volume mysterious vocalize chinese tam tam i favour the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many rationality first of all the chailly recording of the pisces outcry has too much sound reflection also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are confuse because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same deliver as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and palpitate with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus go is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very remainder of the put together in the chailly recording feature article a large low gear bill from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious vocalize chinese tam tam does not occur at the remainder of the chailly recording to ingeminate these power point what i like and favour about the abbado recording is the crisper go and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese tam tam ratiocination the chailly recording render a neat selection of gustav mahler pieces that are not numerate symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other record will enable any hearer to adjudicate on a preferred recording i did my own side by side compare and notice that i had a slim taste for record under the nightstick of simon rattle and claudio abbado coney klagende lie down is my very favorite of gustav mahler physical composition and it has been my favorite since the twelvemonth it was composed when mahler was only xx years old

1	this product takes the course of two compact platter on the decca mark the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocalist is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in hyrax klangende lie the song are not as prominent as the orchestral set up but in all the other put together in the two platter the song are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other put together the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders singing dash if you wish to claim it singing let in a grossly hyperbolize vibrato this bizarre hyperbolize vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly twine to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the hearer to be annoyed devil and angry in some sort of music such as i put a spell on you as immortalize by shrieking john jay coleman hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to take as immortalize by the grindcore isthmus carcase the twine voice is the point of the recording and the twine voice enhances the joy of the mind know but fassbaender fail to agnise that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fail to agnise that gustav mahler music is not some character of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only hyrax klagende lie but am not able bodied to recommend the other put together on this magnetic disk define the compositions on the magnetic disk are all by gustav gustav mahler and they lie in of hyrax klagende lie kindertotenlieder diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn lie eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only tercet of the thirteen of the songs of diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this survey provides a side by side comparison of diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of herb simon rattle the rattle recording is slimly in effect for rationality reveal below this survey also provides a side by side comparison of of the songs from hyrax knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces the fishes with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slimly in effect for the rationality number below second by second describe of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening moments of hyrax klagende lie of my very favorite put together from the classical repertoire waldmarchen menachem begin with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french people trumpet provide a short thumb then at s the transverse flute bring together in the french people trumpet resume at s and at s the john reed and strings bring together the fray at s the french people trumpet bring together in again and here they caper a real number tune not just a thumb at s the tonal pattern put up by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch shot and the antecedently confront motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch shot at infinitesimal and s comes a momentary crescendo it is a prominent crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other set up of hyrax klagende lie are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finicky exceptions that i name below the chailly recording of waldmarchen menachem begin with a downplay noise harkat ul ansar that lasts for a second but the rattle recording pop with music not with any harkat ul ansar comparison waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly time is minute and s while the rattle time is minute and s in the chailly recording the tenor voice werner hollweg brand his trance at min sec singing of the most beautiful tonal pattern in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slimly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor voice henry martyn robert rupture brand his trance at min s henry martyn robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat the like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight taste for the rattle recording for rationality alien to me the chailly recording has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor voice and a baritone the tenor voice is henry martyn robert rupture and the baritone is sean rea the adjacent movement in hyrax klagende lie is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening infinitesimal is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong sea bass stock put up by tuba and string bass part and claxon brass this third gear movement of hyrax klagende lie is distinguished by the front of an off represent isthmus which is often placid than the on represent orchestra the off represent isthmus can be learn for object lesson in the interval of to when the off represent isthmus is playing the only other author of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of fourth dimension this movement also feature a chorus preference for the trace rationality i have a slight taste for the rattle recording of hyrax klagende lie the rattle recording was immortalize at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and spectacular in contrast the chailly recording could be characterise as very slimly muddy also i have a slight taste for henry martyn robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the trace compares hyrax knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only tercet songs as i mention above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a enounce vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the manful while others by the female person my favorite of all of the songs from hyrax knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces the fishes and i the like this the best because it is the same tonal pattern as that constitute in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compares the pisces the fishes song diethylstilboestrol antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery champagne flute motif occurring at s and s and the five second domestic ass the like braying from clarinet that occurs at s and again at s the set up concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding taiwanese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many rationality first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes song has too often reverberation also in the chailly recording the fluttery champagne flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender peach at the same pitch shot as the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender brand her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not often noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the set up in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding taiwanese bell does not pass off at the end of the chailly recording to retell these points what i the like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery transverse flute domestic ass braying and mysterious taiwanese bell determination the chailly recording provides a great selection of gustav mahler put together that are not keep down symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the put together on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any hearer to decide on a favour recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discover that i had a slight taste for recording under the baton of herb simon rattle and claudio abbado hyrax klagende lie is my very favorite of gustav mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when gustav mahler was only twenty years former

minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
