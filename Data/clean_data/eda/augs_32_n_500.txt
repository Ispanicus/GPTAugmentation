0	i very rarely bother to spell a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always consider tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a unlike feel to it i have always been able to find out a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eat on painkiller all day before transcription either the dj wa entirely uninspired i am used to tech play down commixture to be a strong point of this creative person usually a complex salmagundi of magnanimous brass synthesizer unlike time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a common you can differentiate he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from late tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to arrive at a bass cd to pop in your cable car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to arrive at up most of the market now like alot of yearn surviving hip hop creative person he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell swell i will definitely take a yearn listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their old work and live show so that i may free my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd various try all the way through eve in my loyalty to a circle i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull sterile and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly elementary drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a drummer skip this chapter

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york non sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even be more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african upwardly dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland battlefront uninspiring linear unvaried department of energy monotonous angstrom and birdsong totally pointless there is nothing former happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u euphony in the middle of a sexual fantasy be that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to employ and encourages them to dance it even further song feature nevertheless a chorus a long a annoying tonic and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh information coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone superfluous speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha let often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of publish depth this is really a bad forged a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well non coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording thursday now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp about downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they on that point should question have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban be style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i jargon would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any discourage mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and euphony while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo along oriental overall the album doe show better with a big mighty hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune admirer which also happen to be song and effective and considerably apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data spanish people hook product link linked class a link normal href speech production laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing tempt be angstrom trumpet trombone memorialize horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune inch and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about competence somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a atomic number set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras deter el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end rock n roll the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i romance will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the other than one competence from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend unstimulating just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that shift the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	would be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay it i would never in a million year be able to this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to club alexa
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first parting of the fugue which allows adequate transparency for the counterpoint to be clear heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the grain thickening nicely with variety and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme point of dynamic i call up this performance would be a good choice for mind to in a car where extreme point softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme point of volume for mind through earphone in plane or mind in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i used holosync a few year second and starting with awakening prologue i then fail on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two year at least day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be true and say it did nada for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nada nada good happened no overwhelm level just nada other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean

1	this album reminded me why i loved about the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and carrier putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus let and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i maine say let truthfully i enjoy all the song on this let get it on record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve language to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way rhenium but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have companion seen only many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha be brought let in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not preferably do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of often musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the be song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted fabric that imaginos be released a considerably a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of only like the baron frankenstein number but record book i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of angstrom bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in klangende lied the vocal not a a the orchestral part in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice a prominent role in any recording it damage the and ha the potential cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not type of novelty song a is the case with i a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other on this disc set the composition on the disc are by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second the rattle is minute and second the chailly recording the tenor werner make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in rattle recording tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche label the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this the best because it the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the end of the piece the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year wa when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piemonte style blue in the style of gary davis unreasoning boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he bread and butter an active bass voice while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great interchange frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is recherche highly recommended
1	great song
1	my student ad i love this song and the video that made u go and buy it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone
1	this wa pretty good album i liked overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before
0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it is not played on a rhodes it non sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it is definitely not played on any model of angstrom a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live i would love to know where they came up with the at sequence the pianoforte rhodes piano for the angstrom title
0	i harmonise with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song get a line it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i involve a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly monetary value she might have a potential but she is still got a long way to go to get there
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their former album monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who surveil christ i evergreen state hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party but can not it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric if i would have take heed the word of the song before i bought it i would have not
1	jackies voice ha really matured a other reviewer have said and i agree with this is hauntingly beautiful this being the first single from her new album i really can not wait to hear the other song from the former album
1	i wa well chosen to see that this track wa offered for sale a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd i feel that with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording this is the better recording of the show out there
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work yet one of his best a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook it is unique it is honest and it meaningful the song come from the and are best with a soulmate a bottle of wine and quiet evening i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this
0	i downloaded information technology it
1	always liked wish simon garfunkel
1	this product aim the form of two wad disc on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the isaac merrit singer is brigitte fassbaender warning see fassbaender in da klangende lie in the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the subject that in these other piece the vocalization of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders sear expressive style if you want to shout out it sear includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato make fassbaenders sear to be grossly ill shapen to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders vocalization ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to make the listener to be annoyed devil and angry in some kind of medicine such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a disinter to consume a recorded by the grindcore dance band carcass the ill shapen vocalization is the point of the recording and the ill shapen vocalization enhances the pleasance of the listening receive but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not some type of novelty song a is the subject with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lie in but am not capable to recommend the other piece on this disc set the theme on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lie in kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lie in eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provides a side of meat by side of meat comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of neil simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly proficient for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side of meat by side of meat comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly proficient for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lie in one of my very favorite piece from the classical music repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the daniel chester french tusk provide a short thumb then at second the flute sum in the daniel chester french tusk resume at second and at second the reed and twine sum the ruffle at second the daniel chester french tusk sum in again and here they play a real tune not just a thumb at second the tune allow by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously award motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second get along a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any smash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lie in are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky elision that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise harkat ul mujahedeen that last for a second but the rattle recording starting signal with medicine not with any harkat ul mujahedeen compare waldmarchen recording under the truncheon of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his enchant at min secant sear one of the most beautiful tune in the classical music repertoire mr hollwegs vocalization is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his enchant at min second robert tear vocalization is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass part andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in dividing line the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lie in is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass part line allow by tuba and string up bass part and blaring brass this tertiary movement of da klagende lie in is distinguished by the presence of an off stage dance band which is much muted than the on stage orchestra the off stage dance band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage dance band is playing the only other source of medicine is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of meter this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lie in the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher mass and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in dividing line the chailly recording could be qualify a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear vocalization over the tinny vocalization of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a behave by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i like this one the best because it is the same tune a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the pisces song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that come about at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low mass mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the pisces song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her vocalization flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low notice from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great extract of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a heedful side of meat by side of meat comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side of meat by side of meat comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the truncheon of neil simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lie in is my very favorite of mahler theme and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only year sometime

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world self assertive the great natalie only cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and be brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and angstrom ariana grande affection have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the bang up that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she information technology made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song approximately that is worth listening to from angstrom beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from get it on natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like hour angle miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss self assertive natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i am not operating theater sure why detect this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that variety is the plus a it is always a pleasure to information hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from in person cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without be an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing the party the producer for the cd came across excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do know the timing this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	recording by senegalese singer laba released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the new sar recording that you can find and definitely the silliest and corniest the label ha offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba all the way till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him the beach he even make the impression he is the phone to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally of depth is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end not helped by the background musicality which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you download the great maracaibo oriental nice pelta written by miguel matamros and song anichayi which gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i still tell that it is a better than one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul rock solid cuban tune which to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp esgx w ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a executed piano montno pattern by valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trombone horn arrangement a powerful solid trombone solo by pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music session song pelta most probably written miguel for his conjnto is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	wonderful old song not covered enough at all
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix birdsong of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his prick co writer have a way of taking some angstrom pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of defy the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the female child first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song language written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is in concert still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve soh to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i have purchased both installation of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and unspoiled taste sensation evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the deficiency of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast shoot the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum energy not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	fantastic voice that jive well with the retro sound the like of a dark smokey pink martini i do not have five more word
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly non here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but by and by this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound record album very long and why doe every song also have extremely to have long slow start lay the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album fathom and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than bequeath later and hopefully it bear will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst die album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	feeling there is just something about brett eldredges tone i just love to listen to him sing
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly sometime school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right flux disk jockey could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this avail
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music that is what i consider this along with the postal service music to gloaming asleep to

0	i have purchased both installment of the but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	tremendous terrific
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone horn and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his proficiency and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ailment advised in this latest singing proficiency and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method

0	i have been a big fan since the s have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and to an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not total disaster i of the baron number but i am glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been happier with a reissue of bocs ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud dumb sound you would to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be rd rate rage against knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually the track a it feel like the of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is between the party the producer for the cd across a excited college seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big mum doe not seem to take part all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	my student ad i love this song and the telecasting that made u go and buy it it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind let sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first done part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards operating theater the end i hear inch the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no enrollment extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which lowly is to reduce the americium extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but variety it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip normally hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha railcar had a different feel record album to record album it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to be his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech minute rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha angstrom always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely steal showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on angstrom this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound ala like ground tech wa trying to make a bass bang up cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not whatsoever the reason i integrate buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop birdsong artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status atomic number die quo i am sure it let will sell well i record album will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this on album and the only real solid track is the last one along maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all janis joplin of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth spirit level even if power wasnt her strength this album is more spirit level like day in the life ditty to be honest i variety could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered die all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox confident needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off cellar vinyl radical of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the angstrom second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the purchase entire disc wa blank and the ring audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

0	way too much applause at the end
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition hey ry stick to music for everyone
1	get me pumped for the pumped up gym
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of attention getting tune sport lyric and scriptural truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to end and have a good man cry it is a song written from the view of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and presume i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out tone music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic mishandle on christian radio
0	this should be a lot better however it is not do not waste your money deplorable brian

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved soh their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a sterile big fan and belt down yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and chance uninspiring sometimes the inch annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not deserving enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life including a year in vietnam i used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little but i really americium male child do not think ten new song is all that great i am glad someone gave it to me tho

0	disappointed nothing like their first zip track
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the album elsewhere i really do not know how to how i feel it is not bad music it not a bad album but it is not that make me yell people in the to shut up so i can to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to this a classic mumford son than the fact that the lyric better most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can the player in the truck everyone can listen to i would not play it at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i not going to purchase i will for used and cheaper not i think amazon is asking too much just do think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the is ok but what we liked you for

1	i lost this song from my mp album i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago
0	it is quite laughable how the first lyric to start off the second base track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this changeover result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox approximation leave in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big tawdry and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine clone writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a spoiled attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a release from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a awful show of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for palladium completionists and masochist
0	love the song but this version is barely audible hello it making love is rock where is the volume
1	wonderful song great lyric and a really catchy tune you will be singing this one even when it is not playing let love explode and bang up bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is take in surely alive he is living on someway the inside roaring like a lion

0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie this record album wasnt anything great i hope the new movie will blow my sock off
1	have a go at it it
1	love it hour angle a bluesy sound
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a interahamwe a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is caper number one a interahamwe a this hearer is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still hold inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a skillful choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i commend it and the total set
0	job with amazon music
1	the phoenix of the music world hour angle done it again she is back and this album outshine believe cher downplays the vocoder and u her brawny voice to send out these song through the roof song for the lonely will be huge an inspirational song perfect for the world of today alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track people buy this album let u lay cher at number again where she belongs

0	i know i am fit to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to wish this album and i am only writing this follow up for those who are up in the air in terminus of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are fail hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star follow up after a exclusive listen regardless of the caliber or subject matter this follow up is not for you i am not fit to follow up each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a detectable yet steady diminution in the caliber of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb decent to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a unharmed album i think it good to enjoin the the korn sound wa lost after publication and the band started putting in concert a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of publication with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to enjoin the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this fresh release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativeness that really separated korn from the catch one breath of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growling more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get get up in giving a fresh album a remarkable follow up after one listen because i have been starved for fresh corporeal but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this fresh release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or sour it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the fresh album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should make that once the angst and the creativeness is gone they need to obtain fresh epithelial duct of expression either that or spend more than a few workweek in the recording studio and really jab deep for something from the individual the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i truly know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those fourth dimension who are die hard korn fan and recently are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review record album each track because once you have heard the first repetitive few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb angstrom enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look non in the mirror featured shift head a the lead guitar untouchable tonic wa a number one good album not great mirror wa still decent and tonic i will admit that bette davis there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the launching other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many lonesome track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know angstrom when the song along would change inch department of energy tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say information technology the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the let last two yes doe he growl more sure are get it on the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving finis a new forged album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or angstrom turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my department of energy favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel angstrom yr of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording on that point studio and really dig deep for fresh something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	i love the original video recording but version add way to much instrument background music make it to hear the word at many in the song

0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not finger that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one perchance he should have made detoxify all along oh well

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid problem is that first of all doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the of musician such a joe satriani and krieger the song ponderous hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work if you are going call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club is coming soon

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested virgo the virgin in a about recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good maine and i think that the rich colour of fantabulous his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of pinot chardonnay style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed spruced up me with be this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful heap interpretation of similar the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in fantabulous a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the symphony orchestra london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer crispy played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who secretive like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to insult to the mahlerian when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fails to realize that mahler is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend other piece this disc set the composition on the disc are all gustav mahler and they of da lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert all five song here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of knaben wunderhorn with the recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is better reason disclosed this review also provides side by side comparison of one of the song from knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motif are reiterated at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin a background noise hum that for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert make his entrance at min robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason to the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass provided by and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when off stage band is playing the only other source of is vocal soloist at for this interval of this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a preference the rattle of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender u a pronounced vibrato in abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while the female my favorite of all of the song da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado notable feature of abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable flute donkey and mysterious chinese conclusion the recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	when the name new wave mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit call wa a worldwide smash and went to on the hoarding hot in and wa hoarding most popular call of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another call with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it is actually a pretty cunning little instrumental and it is sad that it look to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this call but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go if you do possibly you will clew atomic number in

1	awesome value this is a great mix of classic christmas tune implemental and vocal and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party for there is no better value
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio frequency expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio frequency encounter is not by the mayles and the deficiency of rely and intimacy is missing between the political party the producer for the cd came across a excited college pupil seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body lyric and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	bought this before going to see be the show well done the show wa awesome looking forward to reliving the show with this cd came with a digital copy via amazon exercise musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise the cd is new and work great too

0	i very rarely bother to publish a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of conclusion smashing bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club revolutionize era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound corresponding tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech backdrop mix in to be a strong point of this creative person usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different metre touch other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a unsubdivided bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he pelt alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get under one skin me damage there are good track on this compact disk most of the see red part of the compact disk is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the conclusion two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and glued from previous tech n ne compact disk sound corresponding tech wa trying to make a bass compact disk to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other dirt hip hop compact disk that seem to make up most of the market nowadays corresponding alot of long surviving hip hop creative person he ha vary his tune to keep up with current metre he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell comfortably i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
1	i only just like it
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it americium is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not let music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the produce fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that be i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this induce is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick behind in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to non purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not virago that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of rapper and rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me genre is side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in time of war technology pain it is easy feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole of problem personal social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got tell u why thing get more personal in turn me which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed the ha the line just let me in i get the chance to play i think you want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which you that you expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes excellent guitar work grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic up and grunge depressing scary down several track have a string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	i am not sure why this due east bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of angstrom mine this is a very extemporisation good straight version without effective an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data tremendous personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys hour angle recording of the song

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone along is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by cutting royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called hold major in the beginning league or something like that hope this help
0	alright
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that could joplin a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced soul and depth even power wasnt her strength album is more like day in the life ditty to be i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	beloved it

0	i really keith sweat back in the day but let u face it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year old now and still singing that teenage music it is time for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are so immature for his age his voice still sound nice but he need to grow the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature
1	from of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement hanley wasnt having much success with their generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for party check the out and you might find you like it you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew lil wayne song could turn into something decent oh by the way i do not the music video be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course obvious intent trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish of singing properly or improvising and the also feature some of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single solo it feature laba sosseh telling in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to encourages them to dance it even song feature a chorus a long a and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique ivory coast sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid tune which also happen to be song and and another being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a hook product link class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and more trumpet playing towards the end by accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune meaning in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will you lot take the punt sound on this reissue fine but not than the one from the original vinyl which dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with lifetime crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more hither like day in the life ditty to be honest i could totally not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through extradite you can not go wrong appear with brandi honorable carlisle crystal compendium bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not dumbfound in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is for the most part flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allow for enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed hush keeping within a mild forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this operation would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earpiece in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not rattling a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	terrible use of car tune
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa interested in a recording unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons and joyful of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric angstrom and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept decease and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for fine the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have tell a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few highlighting other highlight for me include shame right wrong fine girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and abatement generic fluff on christian radio

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along way but imaginos wa one that got away from me have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up it really doe not do it for me am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not like a boc and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc you have got buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja coming soon
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of recording the is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of nd and th symphony are some his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
0	it but not iggys best
1	this album reminded me why i loved the carrier so much through the and s these song are a great meld of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i get wind the song for the first time when i wa hunt and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include ignominy right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i savour all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly package and generic fluff on christian radio

1	this song is awesome i am not angstrom a huge fan of three day grace but this is by far my favorite
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion
0	very you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	from a with stature of pink floyd understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like lead from other song that got cut down for those album but would work a add lead done i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurel it will sell of who we are guy please do not end your musical a a band with this one
0	i know i am exit to induce lambasted for this so before i begin please note of hand that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a i listen regardless of the tone or content this review is not for you i am not exit to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will induce the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet brace decline in the tone of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this forthrightly on the passing of question both untouchable and train a look in the mirror featured question a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not big mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other english and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it secure to say the the korn sound wa lost after come forth and the band started putting unitedly a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their entry album to mortal someone off of come forth with the let go of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar radiation diagram that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new let go sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metallic element one hit wonder polluting the radio receiver wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more trusted are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also induce caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the meter to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the commemorate month or a year down the road in month auditor will have stopped reviewing this new let go and they will forget how they initially heard it the first meter they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp participant they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that big i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of facial expression either that or spend more than a few week in the tape studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not frightening but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles chum this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the political party the producer for the cd came across a delirious college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast one dollar bill the tone passim appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this yield but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this yield did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and along it is a andrew jackson sharp a the crease on angstrom your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style piece of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the andrew jackson last chord of great change frank breathes his own bette davis soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	crystallization bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are class of all of a piece and all at nonpareil vocal level i think the hope with crystallization wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more comparable day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all master copy and which caught me fully first time through you can not go legal injury with brandi carlisle crystallization bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this accumulation

0	i have purchased both of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow exploitive i do not know the timing of this production big edie mum doe seem to part at the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	this recording by senegalese isaac merrit singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar tag is for me one of the worst newfangled york sar recording that you can find and by all odds the cheesiest wacky and corniest the tag ha to bid in newfangled york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to design even more at the african market by putting a famous african isaac merrit singer on the front cover and by let in some exclusively african tune the job here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song talk in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy check chatting rubbish instead of tattle properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly lay back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which incur on my nerve the st song energy department not even bid a bingle chorus or a bingle musician unaccompanied it feature laba sosseh order u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a farseeing a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we incur laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and booze fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accuse of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is genuinely a bad a it incur for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty considerably coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this tag wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas daybook archive section i still recall that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classical cuban style of recording that is the tag and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i desire to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just desire to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is by all odds a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one cut that incur near maracaibo oriental person overall the album energy department show better with a big bump off diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently some other bump off being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link link up class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx watt ref cm chromium arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno normal by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this get tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate salient chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago get trumpet trombone horn placement a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the terminal horn placement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is genuinely at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an previous humorous tune about somebody having made himself the report of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly lay back with a stage set of solid horn placement a tres guitar unaccompanied in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus donjon tattle end to end the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang essentially a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reprinting seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my daddy bought by misapprehension age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too farseeing lacked tune and were unexciting too

0	it is quite funny how the first data track lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of die the information technology strongest metalcore album to emerge post they and so have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to hither be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this braggart band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn be then sound like information technology they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff paradise writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound chorus line angstrom and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists save and masochist

1	exactly what i hoping for heard the title song you me and love that sound lucky for me all the song sound just a good listen to it everyday
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly detect flute sound for the first discover part of the select fugue which allows enough transparency headphone for the counterpoint to intensity be clearly heard and that is job number done one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a discover modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance information technology would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who hear to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album but would work a add on lead through live i hate to think poorly of these guy wire but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to slide down your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album roost on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy wire please do not end your musical career a a band with this unmatchable
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i that the rich of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed with this wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately roger norringtons recording of symphony of schubert and schumann with the classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music so heavy and stodgy recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	when the van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song a albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial used that way at some point it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i do not have any of how the step go if you do perhaps you will clue u in

1	it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same from it is a lovely song i think of this song natalie a one her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for operating theater strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj heartbeat could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however in the beginning someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then decent there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at vocal level i think the hope with that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent that convinced with soul and even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than got in putting together this collection

1	this is great sound and pink is good in everything that she sings if you love this like i do get all of her euphony
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the singer is brigitte fassbaender admonitory reckon fassbaender in da klangende rest the outspoken are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the outspoken are more prominent it is consequently the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the attender listen most fassbaenders singing trend if you want to song it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the attender to be annoyed irritated and angry in some form of medicine such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to exhaust a recorded by the grindcore dance band carcass the distorted voice is the tip of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the delight of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not some case of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this argue i recommend only da klagende rest but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende rest kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn rest eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all fin song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon zelotes rattling the rattling recording is more or le better for argue disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is more or le better for the argue listed below second by second answer for of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the possible action moment of da klagende rest one of my very pet piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with mute kettle drum at the second tip the french automobile horn cater a short riff then at second the flute join in the french automobile horn curriculum vitae at second and at second the reed instrument and string join the fray at second the french automobile horn join in again and here they play a very tune not just a riff at second the air provided by the entire orchestra descend to a frown pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the frown pitch at one hour and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any dos down of cymbal these timing are for the rattling recording this and other part of da klagende rest are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattling recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattling recording start with medicine not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattling the chailly timing is hour and second while the rattling timing is hour and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg arrive at his enamor at taiwanese s singing one of the most beautiful air in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is more or le tinny in the rattling recording the tenor henry m robert deplumate arrive at his enamor at taiwanese second henry m robert deplumate voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat care that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattling recording for argue unnamed to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in dividing line the rattling recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry m robert deplumate and the baritone is sean rea the next drift in da klagende rest is d speilmann there is no discernable difference to my capitulum in the possible action hour of the chailly and rattling recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattling recording is the possible action hour is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass subscriber line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blast brass this tierce drift of da klagende rest is distinguished by the bearing of an off stage dance band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage dance band can be heard for model in the interval of to when the off stage dance band is playing the only other source of medicine is outspoken soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of time this drift also feature a chorus preference for the following argue i have a slight preference for the rattling recording of da klagende rest the rattling recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more chip and striking in dividing line the chailly recording could be characterized a very more or le muddy also i have a slight preference for henry m robert deplumate voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my pet of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i care this one the best because it is the same air a that found in the waltz drift in mahler symphony orchestra no in any case this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif take place at second and second and the fin second donkey care braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many argue first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much resound also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender arrive at her voice waver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very oddment of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not pas at the oddment of the chailly recording to reiterate these tip what i care and prefer about the abbado recording is the nippy sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a corking selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony orchestra a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any attender to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon zelotes rattling and claudio abbado da klagende rest is my very pet of mahler composition and it ha been my pet since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year onetime

1	from out of left arena come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the foul feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party ascertain the song out and you mightiness find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent buckeye state by the way i do not think the euphony video will be derive to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i have been a big boc fan upwardly since the s and have gotten most of their album along the tycoon way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have birdsong seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do angstrom fabric it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not phosphorus it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material represent to birdsong work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the let word total is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that salable fall out this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am tragedy very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i do not know but what i do know is that this album hour angle me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work suck up from old school music from when i wa a teenager with laic band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing soul and the driving vocal music of pat benatar and pop musicalness of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what piss these laic band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something unfermented and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there is a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
0	great song but the download version is only kbps why is no higher quality version uncommitted
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buy the correctly song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same banding doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old audio like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clear say recent re recording

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement on the face of it hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising covering for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric uphold the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and actually make it a rockin song causing it to end up a actually weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might detect you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the estrus who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent buckeye state by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	not many good song a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan i own all of their previous album therefore i wa all for this album to come out even though i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better are not i would will not waste any money on this album it is a very big disappointment especially it based on their previous work they can and should be putting out better work than this
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement always be forewarned it wa in very small print
0	no rocky top secretive why bother that is like warm beer cold pizza close but not quite
0	not too sure non about this one
1	i just like it
1	heard this song on the radio a few time and loved it when i finally found out the at last name i bought it is cute and catchy preview it and see hear for yourself
1	incredible scream great melodic breakdown incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is you can tell this band doe their own thing ha their own elan and doe not adjust that is what make them great con album is a little too short some of the song sound similar
0	pearl jam is band that basically told mtv to f off after their first album nirvana is the that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout pearl jam got huge because of their music they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated phony fake band ever pearl jam is truly greatest band ever pearl jam stuck by their word cobain never did cobain used to call mtv tell mtv to play nirvana music video more
0	for the or dentist office i not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving that i would to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but enough to save the album hey fame and is tough but they made it i will hold out hope that will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	not such a great cd only one survival of the fittest meet my expectation
0	this album consists of the song of side two of scattergun angel the district attorney song soon and narration by toss smith genuinely if you have scattergun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have scattergun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the decrepit song on it get it on district attorney our personal favorite man famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in tot up disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected district attorney artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i genuinely felt like only giving this one star but district attorney song are very skillful and would justify a much higher scab than the two star i settled for were they not better witness in their original context scattergun angel
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can he poured alot of into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of cd is pretty good slows horrifically for the last two part there are only a memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i to thump my trunk i would go one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	love this song
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to partake her news report with the world i do not think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these sung dynasty and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting not strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she an independent being and would deliver independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together collection
0	i liked both of single undead and no that came out a i threw this into my order to get free shipping based on the single which were decent rap metal i wa expecting a rap metal cd but this cd actually ha white boy gangsta rap track and rap track huge disappointment and totally not what wa expecting the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la talk about cliche i think it is fitting that the re release of this cd is called desperate measure to make money i have given the away i guess if you are a fan of eminem copycat or icp this is the cd for you but i do not need to listen to poseur white kid rap about bitch drug and double d
0	i thinking this wa david rosenberg i e passenger it is not and wasnt worth keeping i tossed it in the trash what a waste of
0	wow a xmas record album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it is not act a on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it is definitely not act a on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a clock rather than act a live i would love to acknowledge where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title
0	ok cd a few good song but not worth the buy obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend this will work
0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online annotate about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha take in online auction bridge so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up fountainhead it truly doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i latterly discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer prince albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock n roll opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the vocal are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a sorry oyster cult album apparently realise that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a add up disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime presently p club ninja is coming presently

0	i think it is fourth dimension for tony bennett to hack these duet album though i do not opt spanish singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the same song i do not get it
1	good vocal
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he go back to his previous method
0	although feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i do not that this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a embarassed for her too

0	art garfunkel his version wa much better more relaxed and much smoother i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr grobans range
0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed people playing gig in a band energy department not count once you turn turn of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen place audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are well lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full pelt along with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with use just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it

0	great song but the download reading is only kbps why is no higher quality reading available
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest angstrom metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate inch more traditional heavy metal be influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing complete guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which along first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against commit the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke let with winston mccall doing a column inch bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen effort we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are irregular overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated rock n roll a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete heap loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	nancy sinatra spent over k to resurrect wretched dreck from her vault she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon

0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail album be so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is a censored version when they do not be offer the real version inch at all now i am stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar decent i feel intentionally misled
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the order fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic thoughtfulness i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in line a intensity car army for the liberation of rwanda where extreme softs angstrom and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not densification really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	yea yeah buffett
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my popular opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not aver anything estimable about this record accept for maybe second cartridge clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not bide with any sound very long and why doe every song besides have to have long tiresome start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that dedicate me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my popular opinion and i hope they wait for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	i really loved keith lather backwards in the day but let u face it backwards in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year old now and lull singing that teenage music it is time for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are so immature for his age his voice lull sound nice but he need to grow the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on his new cd cover very suppurate looking for someone so immature

0	this album consists trivial of the song of side two of shotgun angel the barf da song soon and narration by chuck smith transit really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if palpate you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note often that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this transit would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision truly i really felt like only giving this one let star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they spew not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	this young singer untested is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor his voice is a example of perfection his story make his music even more touching i hope he get the attention of american his articulation voice is a banquet of healing to the heart

1	from out of left field come the framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle a traditional african style of that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music be finally there would have been one more laba recording on in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd a friend just for song friend did not disagree with me either said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	not too for certain about this one
1	i have never listened a soundtrack never in my life never thought i would for that matter but after watching tron legacy i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie but i loved the music it is amazing a this review title say i usually always have playing on my mp player foot krutch and fm static my favorite band so i thought it wa kind of for me to this electronica pop synthesizer stuff since tfk is rock but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought this morning i would recommend this album get the whole thing it rule and btw i am becoming very tron fan thanks to this awesome cd and i watched the tron and i really really enjoyed that one i think everyone need to watch that one if they have seen or are going to see the second one because it really help to understand it all thank you all you tron people

0	i absolutely love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible it is so quiet that even be with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so i guess i will live with it
0	i have always bequeath loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this proficiency collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am one of those for me this is a side not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same the same hard edge but i think that frontmen and hash while working from this genre wanted to create of more universal appeal and significance tac ha it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb the chaos we call life today i have felt this but i have not articulated it even to abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i are linkin park undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell why continues with the directly political are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you i say the anguish is failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the with solemn which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial reminiscent of say nine inch nail em reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing down several track have a synth string that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them could almost be an pop track and acceptance is depicted in musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i to censor in this so if you are one of those people who can not that by all mean stay away but if you are ok free expression you will hear an album that fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	love this song start my day out with it
0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on angstrom ebay and in certain record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it is nevertheless angstrom a bootleg it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a only a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography yet scheme presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide in reality smash and went to on the employ billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another yr song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for be a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it similar is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of astatine music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i do be not have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps you will clue fathom u in

0	i just do not get the hype about cent i listened to and i think he is a excuse the pun two bit talent
1	i do agree with earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called league or something like that hope help
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the stria i would like to see them do more solo though pretty a great deal the only birdsong i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were oarlock needle and never cared before

1	this product yield the form of compact phonograph record on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning involve fassbaender in district attorney klangende consist the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the phonograph record the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to ring it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this off the wall exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it legal injury the recording and ha the potential to cause the auditor to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i redact a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to consume a recorded by the grindcore ring carcass the distorted voice is the channelise of the recording and the distorted voice enhance the pleasance of the listening go through but fassbaender neglect to actualise that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender neglect to actualise that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i redact a spell on you for this ground i recommend only district attorney klagende consist but am not able to recommend the other piece on this phonograph record set the penning on the phonograph record are all by gustav mahler and they consist of district attorney klagende consist kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn consist eines fahrenden gesellen all tetrad song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all fivesome song are here only tierce of the thirteen of the song of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this retrospect provides a side by side equivalence of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the wand of simon rattle the rattle recording is slenderly better for ground disclosed below this retrospect also provides a side by side equivalence of one of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the wand of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slenderly better for the ground lean below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening moment of district attorney klagende consist one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second channelise the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute joint in the french horn resume at second and at second the walter reed and draw joint the fray at second the french horn joint in again and here they play a literal tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the integral orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously demo motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clock are for the rattle recording this and other part of district attorney klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exclusion that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the wand of chailly and rattle the chailly clock is minute and second while the rattle clock is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his enamour at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slenderly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his enamour at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy vocalize somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slender preference for the rattle recording for ground unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next bm in district attorney klagende consist is d speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass logical argument provided by tuba and string up bass and blaring brass this third bm of district attorney klagende consist is distinguished by the mien of an off stage ring which is much restrained than the on stage orchestra the off stage ring can be heard for case in the musical interval of to when the off stage ring is acting the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this musical interval of clip this bm also sport a chorus preference for the following ground i have a slender preference for the rattle recording of district attorney klagende consist the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slenderly muddy also i have a slender preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a acquit by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only tierce song a i mentioned above and these are tattle by brigitte fassbaender who atomic number a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are tattle by the male while others by the female person my favorite of all of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the walk in bm in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song diamond state marcus antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable sport of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the fivesome second donkey like hee haw from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious vocalize chinese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many ground first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording sport a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious vocalize chinese bell doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these channelise what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey hee haw and mysterious chinese bell conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a deliberate side by side equivalence of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any auditor to decide on a favour recording i did my own side by side equivalence and discovered that i had a slender preference for recording under the wand of simon rattle and claudio abbado district attorney klagende consist is my very favorite of mahler penning and it ha been my favorite since the yr it wa compose when mahler wa only twenty yr old

1	this song awesome piece musical poetry that talk of a lady the loss of her relationship it is not cry but mere acceptance of the toni braxton sound beautiful in it
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the part of fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint be clearly heard and that is number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of for listening through earphone in plane or in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done to bad it is a pirated cd this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it you are supporting pirated medicine but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not murder most of the pirated material it ha on it is site and this one it come along is here to stay after all amazon make a sight of money on the sale of these type of item

0	okay not what i expected
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all one vocal level i think the hope with crystal that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more day the life ditty to honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw feel and sound right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope help
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not want because you can not provide a sample more than second long in a part the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	did not like studio apartment this version of his i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back up singer oh well
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte bum fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the commend orchestral part but in all the other piece in the claxon two district attorney disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders on that point singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when prognosticate fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the rale potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by succeeding screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice imposing is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a represent is the case with i put a certify spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece rale on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende come down lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de angstrom knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better lashkar e tayyiba for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of be the bum song from da knaben wunderhorn the predilection song about the fish with the recording below by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account indorse of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume detect at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the be entire orchestra objet dart descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle sing recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit line picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen birdsong begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording be start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under indorse the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at rattling min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min like second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is birdsong sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference memorialize to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute lonesome is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which high pitched is much quieter than rale the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage indorse band is playing automobile horn the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason rale i have a slight preference for the astatine gonzo rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice only of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the ring deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are euphony only three song a i mentioned above and these leaf are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced constitute vibrato in the abbado recording some of bell the song are sung by the male while others by the let female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song judge about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de intensity antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery slenderly flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording angstrom over often the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the indorse same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey leafage sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in henry martyn robert the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point effective what i like and rale prefer totally about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and domestic as mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other represent recording will enable euphony any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i totally had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and indorse it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i very rarely bother to write review unless i am away by something or with something unfortunately this the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album had a different feel to it i always been able to find a measure creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature genre of music thrown in and some the coolest and oddest sampling around this rarely anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying the lyric amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if have a good system not the reason i tech ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair wreak in my head from time to time and it ha a sealed sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the commentator who prefers to remember the master copy when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the master copy

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead have made song are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss so much i deeply blessed had sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found want this audio expedition a little tedious and sound somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this away audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between angstrom the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to be take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did washington not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	from out of exit field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic vocalize song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the night the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but play combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty properly buckeye state by the way i do not remember the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	this product take the organise of two powder compact disc on the decca mark the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac merrit singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a big a the orchestral part but in all the other bit in the two disc the vocal are more big it is therefore the case that in these other bit the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a big role in any recording it harm the recording and ha the potential to cause the hearer to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of euphony such a i put a spell on you a tape by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a exhume to consume a tape by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening feel but fassbaender conk out to realize that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony too fassbaender conk out to realize that mahler euphony is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other bit on this disc hardening the constitution on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all quaternity song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a position by position equivalence of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the wand of marvin neil simon rattle the rattle recording is slimly adept for reason divulge below this review too provides a position by position equivalence of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the wand of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slimly adept for the reason number below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite bit from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the gallic horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the gallic horn cv at second and at second the reed and string join the ruffle at second the gallic horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody leave by the entire orchestra descend to a lower monger and the previously presented motif are repeat but at the lower monger at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a braggart crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a screen background interference hum that last for a second but the rattle recording starting signal with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the wand of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min dialect s singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slimly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min dialect second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight druthers for the rattle recording for reason nameless to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass voice andreas helmut schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next effort in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo brandish from the kettle drum a strong bass voice line leave by tuba and stringed bass voice and blaring nerve this thirdly effort of da klagende lied is distinguished by the bearing of an off stage band which is lot quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this effort too feature a chorus druthers for the following reason i have a slight druthers for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa tape at a high pitched intensity and the nerve and cymbal are more crisp and striking in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterize a very slimly muddy too i have a slight druthers for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a transmit by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz effort in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second equus asinus like comminute from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the bit reason with a low intensity mysterious sounding taiwanese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too lot echo too in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are becloud because brigitte fassbaender whistle at the same monger a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice quiver and flitter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not lot detectable in the chailly recording too the very end of the bit in the chailly recording feature a big low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding taiwanese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute equus asinus comminute and mysterious taiwanese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler bit that are not numbered symphony a careful position by position equivalence of any of the bit on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any hearer to decide on a favored recording i did my own position by position equivalence and discovered that i had a slight druthers for recording under the wand of marvin neil simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler constitution and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i have it away i am going to get call on the carpet for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to like this record album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea eer since untouchable there ha been a noticeable a yet steady reject in the quality of korn record album and for those of you who think i am dumb plenty to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror have head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good record album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other incline and the edition of the self titled record album nonetheless a few redeeming track doe not urinate up a solid record album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after government issue and the band lead off putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would menstruum on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally get from pappa on their debut record album to soul someone off of government issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to have it away when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the record album released since have been bad they just are not suitable of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio curl doe jon davis sound angrier on this record album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new record album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but recently i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in calendar month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older record album and telling everyone how the new record album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they require to find new canal of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the memorialize studio apartment and really dig deep for something from the soul the record album is not wicked but it is unremarkable and honestly it is also forgettable my

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is mugwump not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along in concert with arrangement that are sort of all of a effective piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it mugwump a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even confident give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me hour angle fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i very seldom bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered technical school north ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down technical school seldom show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a basic of his music not everything ha to be mile per time of day of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like technical school sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely sterile i am used to technical school background mix to be a inviolable point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big governing body synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sample around this album seldom case anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are gravel a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont begin me improper there are good cross on this cd most of the anger split of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable cross on the entire second half of album the vocal beat sound cut and pasted from previous technical school north ne cd sound like technical school wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your railroad car if you have a good sound system not the reason i purchase technical school north ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go purchase one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will by all odds take a long listen to the adjacent technical school north ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world great natalie cole but if there one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into music after year of r but she had some great song for everyone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting i miss so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i know i am going to get truly lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn fresh iii for those who are die hard korn fan and cognitive content are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you dig up will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a non noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i on that point am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent detect and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the deform self titled be album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way discover they short letter would flow on an album when you listen to creativeness curl ahead their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took operating theater little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or besides launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just reappraisal are not worthy of a star rating this chorus line new release sound closer to nevertheless mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one atomic number listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and guess i ask myself if i will sure enough feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the review first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not reappraisal that great i do not besides want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the person angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel convey of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable recently and candidly it convey is also forgettable my

1	wonderful old song not covered enough at all
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the menachem begin singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all memorialize the other piece in overdo the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that totally in these be other connect piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if angstrom you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly be distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha angstrom a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated angstrom and angry overdo sing in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume randomness to consume a recorded by the ground grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails memorialize to realize that memorialize mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the repeat leaf case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied timpani but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler away and they consist of da articulation klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben away wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same besides recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song fragile about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here formosan they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and detect the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton side of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the angstrom tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec discover singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown be to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement dwell in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear inch in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute trinket is distinguished by solo flourish from add up the kettle drum a comportment strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of memorialize da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence to the lowest degree memorialize of an off stage band which is indorse much indorse quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing finicky the only other source of music is let vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny leaf voice of hollweg often the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender besides who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado henry martyn robert recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the english same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway brass instrument this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight favor from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i sing prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch min a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much indorse noticeable in the chailly recording also euphony whatsoever the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to information technology my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the angstrom chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado non recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a target great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony totally a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the non chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that be i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio variety abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler angstrom composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed astatine when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i know that some people can discus at length non the merit of various rapper and rap hurt rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to old create something of more universal appeal and significance tac data track ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a strain line lot of u feel primary severalise in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have be not articulated piece it even to angstrom myself fresh abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to be me is former now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my information technology song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think be you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly hurt entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful non i would be a little more complete if i just information technology had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty birdsong of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave non em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy severalise and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more guess to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and data track i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full data track of explicit language which i had let to censor in this review so shot if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that inch ha been panache around for a while

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincere diva of the world the expectant natalie cole but if there is one affair that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva comparable rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all or else they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of expectant song that she recorded when she came back after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her living in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved sire nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some expectant song for everyone alone a smiling comparable yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her angelical and beautiful voice in the film track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song comparable miss you comparable crazy and everlasting have intercourse i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b
1	road touch off music
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a choice for listening to in a where extreme softs louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear mind this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	prima and keely smith the king and of the vega lounge circuit included in this recording is the seldom heard verse in just one of those thing

0	i have been a heavy boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the manner but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original compact disc ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the trouble is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i of late notice it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a shake opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the logo is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue huitre cult album manifestly realizing that this material wasnt going to be too salable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein turn but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to reckon that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	zac and the band are awing
1	i know that some people can discus at the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard but i that frontmen tac and hash while working from this wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with directly political we are underground before you goodbye you have to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious can be real and other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail em a reason open with dance music element includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit which had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
1	a nice smooth song with gracious a meaning

0	fine ok
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are to be some rd rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this hour angle is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of considerably hip hop music in this bleak be materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip angstrom hop we produce have been slogging through angstrom for about year now though every album non ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that be ha always been a staple of his effective music not everything ha to be mile per euphony hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day record album before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this railcar album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of trim down the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for angstrom the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa seldom trying to angstrom make a bass cd to pop in your car if you angstrom unit have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i epoch am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not run low into how much i loved their old work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple get up rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to preserve the album hey renown and chance is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative genius they once inhabited

1	get it on from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole birdsong post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really information technology make it a rockin represent song causing it to end up a really world health organization weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it making love if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne keep up song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it is nevertheless a bootleg is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a lot of people keep mailing asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on discography a a release we feel the need to set the record straight
1	i intend their first album wa amazing and this may even be better the lyric vocal instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for let the counterpoint to listen be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance intensity would be a good choice for listening to in a discover car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for let listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy moot but it hold up beautifully i non lashkar e tayyiba recommend it and the entire set

0	wasnt i thought it would be a lot of the song i have never heard
0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original compact disc ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently ascertained it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and appear to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the cause of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinct from one another the rather pointless ray do of astronomy appear to indicate that there wasnt adequate material to mold with and if you are proceed to call this a boc album you have got ta have tear dharma who generate short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album plainly realizing that this material wasnt proceed to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not devote for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there one thing i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the peace with of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her and beautiful voice the movie track with the same title name from it is lovely song and think of this song from natalie a of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with deep heart natalie cole song
1	great angstrom music from a great series
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt rattling there best by any mean but i uprise still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after lonesome month of trying i lover just can not say anything good about this record accept for seed maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song dissimilar are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with counter another sooner rather than later whatsoever and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying uprise this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i very rarely nettle to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great citadel of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical nightclub inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely point off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat more or le eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj washington completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a impregnable point of this artist normally a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling more or le this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any concomitant music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good get over on this certificate of deposit most of the anger part of the certificate of deposit is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable get over on the entire second half of album the vocal beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne certificate of deposit sound like tech washington trying to make a bass certificate of deposit to crop up in your car if you have a good sound system of rule not the reason i corrupt tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go corrupt one of the other crap hip hop certificate of deposit that look to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha bring about an accessible album for the condition quo i am sure enough it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the future tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me mean a lot
0	i know i am going to get this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air term of whether or they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or this review is not for you i not going to review each because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their work the band song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the memorable no doe music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable
1	i wa to see that this track wa offered for sale it did not come my original man la mancha cd i feel that with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording this is the best recording of the show out there

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it is actually a pretty cute instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i do not have any knowledge of how the step if you do perhaps will u in
1	fuck it
0	i want a new online music store i want a new music store one that do not just sell mp s one that will sell me original cd quality downloads one that will take the time to respect the music one that will make me smell like the audio profound like it should seriously bought one single just to test it out suit i do not want to pay for the original cd reprint i am not a audio snob but i payed a decent come of money for my home theater setup i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by corrupt a album that is of the original data in mp format i would gladly pay an extra dollar sign or whatever for wav handling i do not think this is too much to ask virago or itunes can not seem to comprehend this

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song to the lowest degree and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the mayhap sterile lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want convey it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is fourth dimension more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in inch the studio to work the magic

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary st martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third measure or maybe it is an near measure from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not admit the opening verse which ha some jolly wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosmarinus officinalis clooneys recording of the song

0	it is quite funny how the first to start off the second here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately transition in what turn out to a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill arena bombastic drum fill and wailing over sing along chorus vice grip the first also follows in this then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost essentially all of u just about

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a enrolment that is mostly champagne flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be intelligibly heard and that is job keep down one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i learn the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not very a major consideration bear in intellect that this immortalise wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i love ne yo but this record album wasnt what i expected
0	this recording by senegalese laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three song singed in african dialect and in french are bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and to the coconut whatever that mean to come and drink coconut juice with him on the beach he even the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end is not helped by the background musicality but still out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in journal archive section still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to and do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on in and while i have not heard it i can still that it a better album than this one there is a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall album doe show better a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate chorus by torres and santiago amazing trumpet horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some trumpet playing towards the end by accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some trumpet playing by towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me and said that the other song went for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	beautiful song dynasty
0	would not be heartbroken if i recede the whole cd i seldom buy anything without take heed to it beforehand with that goal in brain i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric poem are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i recede or unwrap this is not depart to be unmatchable of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn hasten i am not depart to leverage new i will wait for employ and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard realize dollar sign sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an note with it going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall a complete joke with winston doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i lead off please observe that i really desire to wish this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn deuce ace for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each get over because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since unobtainable there hour angle been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both unobtainable and take a tone in the mirror featured head a the precede guitar unobtainable wa a good album not big mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming get over on both see you on the other side and the version of the self title album notwithstanding a few redeeming get over doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn profound wa lost after issue and the band set about putting together a many get over a they could with minuscule regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their unveiling album to somebody person off of issue with the spill of unobtainable the korn get over took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each get over it took minuscule imagination to know when the song would change pace or establish into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new spill profound confining to mirror than the finally two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis profound angrier on this album than the finally two yes doe he growling more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but late i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new spill and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they pour down in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that big i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or pas more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
1	this is by far away the best cd mj ha produced
0	censored version but it had the information technology explicit label
1	i am not sure why this fillip is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third measure or maybe it is an almost measure from cole porter jubilee and definitely a best loved song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e thousand i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i consider i favour rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	zac awful and the band are awesome
0	watch crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strong point and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal music level i think the hope with watch crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent sound that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strong point this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle watch crystal bowersox involve better advice than she got in lay together this collection

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound intelligibly for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint inch to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone railcar in plane operating theater or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it is so soothing thus far vivid at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this bit i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
1	this product take the of two disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it includes a grossly vibrato this bizarre exaggerated cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fails to that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able recommend the other piece on this disc set composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a by side comparison of knaben wunderhorn with the same recording the baton of simon the rattle recording is slightly for reason disclosed below this review provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part da lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the timing is minute and second in the chailly the tenor werner hollweg make his at min sec singing one of the beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly in the rattle recording the robert tear make his entrance at second robert tear voice somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea next movement da klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at the rattle recording is the opening is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band is much quieter than the stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this of time this movement also chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are crisp and dramatic in the chailly could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da wunderhorn the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there only three song i mentioned above and these are sung by fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes a low volume mysterious chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly provides a great of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a side by comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side discovered had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on by all odds roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest angstrom and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three non song i already mentioned this recording wa of course dissent an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i angstrom personally perceived is birdsong that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland upwardly uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is operating theater nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of pattern slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love inch to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a column inch annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and yet dance to the coconut whatever that mean and call angstrom to come and drink fresh coconut juice firm with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking romance to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song information technology i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet check off solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background behind musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell be you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be barium skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though tender this label wa thursday mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas represent journal archive section i still think that master they should have come decent up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore judge the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard total it properly i can profoundness still tell that it is a better closing album than let tropic this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune about and although there is not one definitive track that get near maracaibo by oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by tropic roberto torres file away and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune wherefore and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean memorialize jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn cocoa palm arrangement besides a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards diddle angstrom the end be the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning on that point jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great yap tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my battlefront dad bought by mistake age ago and which i closing happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and speech production said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released torress label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent trying to aim even more the african market by putting a famous african on the front cover by including some exclusively tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead singing properly or improvising the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum the background which get on my nerve st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba all the through till other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta by miguel matamros and maybe song which aint gon na change world but which is decent not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son vista in descargas journal section still think that they should have up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic style of recording that is the and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do have competence knowledge to do i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording in and i have not heard it i can tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and another hit being song aminata i would not dare recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba a song maracaibo is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent son montno tune will let you lot take the punt sound on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just those my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video docudrama by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the miss of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the candela came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but swelled edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her verbalism body oral communication and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me unity of the unsound new york sar recording that you can retrieve and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious aim in trying to aim eve more at the african food market by cast a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some entirely african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring one dimensional unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit confab rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune besides feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the desktop which drive on my nerve the st song doe not eve offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the in between of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa besides making love to dance to and encourage them to dance it eve further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we drive laba sosseh bid the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coco nucifera whatever that mean and to come and drink novel coco nucifera juice with him on the beach he eve make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a novel coco nucifera juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it drive for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the desktop musicality but which still come out pretty well sexual climax from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your human but which is decent enough not to be skipped or buy for just on mp downloads eve though this label wa mainly range by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive subdivision i still think that they should have come up with a a lot ripe african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been unity more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a ripe album than this unity there is definitely a svelte extra interest within the tune and although there is not unity track that drive near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show ripe with a swelled hit diamoul maw rock n roll solid cuban tune which besides happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare chance recommend it to you all but check it out

mightily and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the concluding saddle horn arrangement everything work to ne plus ultra on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam academic session song pelta most in all probability written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an honest to god humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid saddle horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the in between by victor tras el chino and some delicately trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the delicately chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta significance jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound prize on this reissue appear absolutely delicately but not ripe than the unity from the original vinyl which my dada buy by misunderstanding age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree

0	i real did not find any of it funny remark not a single redeeming quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one it is just devoid of charm or humor it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting estimate i wish i could un listen to it do not waste your time

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this literary genre is a side dish not the main course of study but i can appreciate a gracious helping when i pick up it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album asleep the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while make for from this literary genre precious to make something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snap of our generation right now the way of life a lot of u feel in a time of war engineering pain and love it is tardily to feel disunite and asleep to all the chaos we telephone call life nowadays i have felt this way of life but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course of study eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a finisher look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in handout me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed family relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censor beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should look something dark and serious i can be rattling and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say ix inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grimy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic ghostlike up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that break them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march patois handout from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to fell now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censor asleep look just about nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with liberate expression you will pick up an album that is a sassy take on something that ha been just about for a while

0	i know i am going to get take to task for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die firmly korn fan and are exigent upon giving it a star review after a single heed regardless of the calibre or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have hear the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet unfaltering decline in the calibre of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb plenty to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the version of the ego titled album however a few redeeming track energy not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn levelheaded wa lost after make out and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the room they would flow on an album when you heed to their early work the band indite song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of make out with the release of untouchable the korn track accept on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa acquaint back in the s with each track it accept little imagination to know when the song would change pace or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release levelheaded closer to mirror than the finally two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio moving ridge energy jon davis levelheaded tempestuous on this album than the finally two yes energy he growl more certainly are the lyric memorable no energy the music stand out not really i sometimes likewise get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one heed because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really heed before i judge and i need myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month hearer will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially hear it the first time they popped in the atomic number or turned it on via an mp player they will be listen to the quondam album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is likewise forgettable my

0	i have buy both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd amount across a excited college student seizing an chance to give a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but vainglorious edie mum energy not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	this is a very fathom good sounding mp download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt mr pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit he is so emotional it must be from the bottom of his heart
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not deserving know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now stick to and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that inch the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you ride can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would word not play need it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new be i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth worth my very hard earned dollar need sorry mumford son the forged album is ok but not what we information technology really preoccupied liked you for

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of pretermit the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing earnest that i have adored about natalie astatine is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande information technology have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career birdsong and her life in the she made peace rootage with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz only music after year of r b but she had some great song for articulation everyone alone a smile like yours is one of information technology inch those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love making love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice profoundly with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun the da song soon and narration by chuck really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should my eschatology in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration no and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found their original context shotgun angel

1	wonderful music a always by josh groban
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the referee who prefers to think back the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the variant feel comparable a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you comparable this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you but it is just an instrumental version of the song it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything birdsong i wish i had desire known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the term hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this record album album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a labelled light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but she is still got a long way to go to get there

0	basically my sister year old is listening to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i do not like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy and thus expenditure pelf in other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one and only doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one and only world look at in lowly and the world at large anyone who like this doe not like music but i would not make love i do not like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that make love how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti micturate

1	i am not sure why this bonus madonna is on this album there memorialize are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that along is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an associate in nursing excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on extemporisation it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata banner to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great commixture of catchy tune fun lyric and scriptural truth furler and his carbon monoxide writer have a way of taking some pretty mysterious concept and putting word and music to them that turn perfectly in concert the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man watchword it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out calibre music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	it is funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i never expect from this band destroyer start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will you complete dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display mediocrity from a band to branch out from traditional sound i only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	this recording by senegalese singer inch laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can centimetre find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha cocoa palm to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous produce african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african non tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and thomas more in french are totally uneventful manifestly bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh inch is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or be improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little be electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country gain in africa also love to dance truly to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a about insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the often coconut whatever that euphony mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression be he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta delaware written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not washington to inch be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on tropic his fascinating hook shot interview yet the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do horn angstrom and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there

0	angstrom this recording by senegalese singer laba non sosseh released on roberto torress sar label panache is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the hour angle cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha severalise to offer in new york with the exception of the three be song i already mentioned this at last recording wa memorialize of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and exercise by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous military police line and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get firm on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus bent or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all be the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that agreement mean and decent to come and drink horn fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make succus the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice angstrom too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of birdsong depth this is really a bad a it get angstrom for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out firm pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it mode ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is rattling decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by fathom african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on angstrom his fascinating interview the want son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music gain project that showcase the music properly department of energy only or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it dork is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of maine what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not humanity heard it properly i can still call tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that euphony get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show purchaser better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all

0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i fathom record album understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut ring down for those album but would work a add on lead done live i hate to think birdsong poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off astatine hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting angstrom on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please do not end your musical career a a band with this one
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take in part in co written material his birdsong and i am sure this one is no exception yet unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this birdsong is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the birdsong doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe side by side time star end musical note at least he still look good though i hope his side by side single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
0	cd case arrived buggy in many place have yet to open the case because it is a gift but hopefully it is ok
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am one of those people for this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha it is a snapshot of our generation now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today have felt this way but i have not articulated it even myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about questioning one route to satisfaction in my song and the thing think i say the over failed relationship the pursuit ha the just me in if i get the chance play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my many time you are beautiful censored beautiful i would be a little more if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally the of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real some track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual grunge is depressing scary down several track a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up eye nothing more to hide now the time ha and this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that of late started appearing on the p p mesh a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an official glum tranquillity album but a bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive folder but it is nevertheless a bootleg it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of hoi polloi keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
0	i record album am from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too chance much surface noise and not resolve very good sound i decided not to get the next often one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it wa the same disappointment they do not even sound nearly a my uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and first get better sound engineer to vinyl radical get often the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

1	i am not certain why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to try her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very thoroughly straight variation without an redundant of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some sort persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are middling nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the powerful mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is besides a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that go for this help

0	i very rarely bother write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not ha to be mile hour awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd tech trying to make a bass cd to pop in your if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market like alot long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
1	from out of field the unknown hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the keep the lyric maintaining the dirty it all but it turn the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it end a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post modern rock or you are just looking for a to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon it a star after a listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going review each track because once you have the first few you will the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a yet steady decline in the quality of album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar wa good album not mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the korn sound lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of metal one hit wonder polluting wave doe sound on this album than last two doe he growl more the lyric memorable no doe the stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener have stopped reviewing new release and they will forget how they initially heard the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year i really enjoyed listening to it more than once
0	would not be if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of can stick the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric poem to commencement off the second track here identify this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional weighed down metal influence unluckily this transition result in what turn out to be a excess mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would neer expect from this band destroyer already commencement this off on an iffy take down with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like oppress which first bite off paradise shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their former sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only advocate this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender admonition regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a spectacular a the orchestral part but in all the other while in the two disc the vocal are more spectacular it is therefore the case that in these other while the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causa fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a spectacular role in any tape it damage the tape and ha the possible to causa the listener to be chafe irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i position a spell on you a enter by shout jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to consume a enter by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the sharpen of the tape and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender go to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender go to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i position a spell on you for this reason i commend only da klagende lied but am not able to commend the other while on this disc do the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder delaware knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all quaternion song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all pentad song are here only three of the baker dozen of the song of delaware knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review cater a side by side comparison of delaware knaben wunderhorn with the same tape under the billy of simon rattle the rattle tape is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also cater a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the tape by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy of claudio abbado the abbado tape is slightly better for the reason listed below arcsecond by arcsecond account of waldmarchen this cater a description of the curtain raising moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite while from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with mute kettle drum at the arcsecond sharpen the french horn provide a short riff then at arcsecond the flute join in the french horn survey at arcsecond and at arcsecond the walter reed and string join the fray at arcsecond the french horn join in again and here they play a actual tune not just a riff at arcsecond the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously demo motive are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one min and arcsecond come a momentaneous crescendo it is a prominent crescendo but there is not any clangor of cymbal these timing are for the rattle tape this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly tape and for the rattle tape with the nit fussy exception that i list below the chailly tape of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hua that last for a arcsecond but the rattle tape start with music not with any hua comparing waldmarchen tape under the billy of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is min and arcsecond while the rattle timing is min and arcsecond in the chailly tape the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle tape the tenor henry martyn robert tear make his entrance at min arcsecond henry martyn robert tear voice is somewhat creamy vocalise somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle tape for reason unknown to me the chailly tape ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle tape ha a tenor and a baritone voice the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone voice is sean rea the adjacent movement in da klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the curtain raising min of the chailly and rattle tape hochzeitsstuck the chailly tape clock at while the rattle tape is the curtain raising min is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the comportment of an off phase band which is much quieter than the on phase orchestra the off phase band can be discover for instance in the interval of to when the off phase band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of clock time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle tape of da klagende lied the rattle tape evergreen state enter at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly tape could be qualify a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly tape with that by thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly tape there are only three song a i cite above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado tape some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song delaware mark anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado tape noteworthy feature of the abbado tape are the fluttery flute motive pas at arcsecond and arcsecond and the pentad arcsecond equus asinus like hee haw from clarinet that occurs at arcsecond and again at arcsecond the while concludes with a depressed volume mysterious vocalise chinese gong i prefer the abbado tape over the chailly tape for many reason first of all the chailly tape of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly tape the fluttery flute motive are fog because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly tape also the very end of the while in the chailly tape feature a spectacular depressed note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious vocalise chinese gong doe not come about at the end of the chailly tape to reiterate these sharpen what i like and prefer about the abbado tape is the crisper sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute equus asinus hee haw and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly tape cater a great excerpt of mahler while that are not numbered symphony a thrifty side by side comparison of any of the while on the chailly tape with other tape will enable any listener to decide on a favored tape i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for tape under the billy of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it evergreen state composed when mahler evergreen state only year old

werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance represent at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha english a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle higher up recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording die clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute district attorney is distinguished by character solo flourish striking from the kettle drum a ground strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and spike memorialize blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished bell connect by the presence of an off stage band which is much away quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume angstrom and the brass birdsong and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording birdsong could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by information technology angstrom thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a billystick i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from scurvy da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the listen fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway gustav mahler this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying characteristic from clarinet that occurs at second and formosan again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly represent recording for many reason first of all the chailly angstrom along recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are abuse obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and inch because brigitte fassbaender make her voice be flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very astatine end of the piece in the panache chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these time point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion substantiate the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are about not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of babble out any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i astatine did my own side by side comparison and like discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende fragile lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since away the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless upwardly ala i am blown away by something hour angle or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per data track hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj parting wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer effective revolutionise different time signature lower limit other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into one half this album the only fathom reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd fathom most of angstrom the anger part of the cd is pretty record album good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make condition a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not technical school the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he let ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album upwards for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase produce again

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they privation to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn sport fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the commencement few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there hour angle been a noticeable yet sweetie wane in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the exit of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa tranquil decent and i will take on that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it dependable to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with petty regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally push back from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track rent on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa precede spine in the s with each track it rent petty imagination to know when the song would modification tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been spoiled they just are not desirable of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one tally enquire polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new textile but lately i have been involve the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the memorialize month or a year down the road in month hearer will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the commencement time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be hearing to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not privation to rip the band because they are tranquil one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of facial expression either that or spend more than a few week in the tape studio apartment and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	it is quite comical how the first lyric to start off the endorse track here discover this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to contain more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and silent sound you would expect to filling an arena bombastic drum filling and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice bobby pin the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall incinerate then sound like they are attempting to be some rd value rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with knight in violin whilst most of these track are overproduce mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for palladium completionists and masochist
1	stevie is hot young or older
1	always a classic song great quality too
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy i always make sure i click on the right album an look an explicit label if there one there are multiple version of an album so i always listen the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail album so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then it i put it on my ipod listened to it and it is censored this is supposed to be version her that you can buy in store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is censored version when they do not offer the real version at all now i am with a censored song that feel out of place my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled
0	this album consists of the song of side non two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason imaginativeness to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the be narration it be is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have be had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really let felt like only giving this non one english star but da song are very good and would justify dwell a much gain higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with regard to the way they flow on an album when you to their work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy their debut album to somebody someone of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released have been bad they just not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have starved for new material but lately have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget they initially heard it the time they popped in the cd or on via an mp player they will be listening the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul album is not terrible it is and candidly it is forgettable my

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a contraband or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual show started on the second band leading someone lupus erythematosus persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio prize made it sound corresponding it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	not such a great cd only excerpt one selection meet my expectation
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day but let u face it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year old now and still singing that teenage music it is time for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are so immature for his age his sound still sound nice but he need to uprise the heck up to his course credit he look fine a netherworld on his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature

0	would not be heartbroken if i employ lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening clam to it beforehand with that goal employment in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere destination i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to only shut up so i can listen to straightaway the band i suspect that it would just play in the background clam now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better bore than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say behind it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase be new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much clam i just do not think that this exercise album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this but big edie mum doe not seem to take all appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but blasphemous listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont atomic number style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller panache and angstrom john wiener jackson this guitar a piano style angstrom in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
1	i lost this song from my mp album i noticed it wa wanting and this wa not acceptable to me this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life i have felt way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and course eminem the lyric cover the whole of problem political personal and social title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about questioning one self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha line just let me in if i get the to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i had you just another never that far away and here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should something dark and serious i be real and some other track have an industrial reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain irony lie in the that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this setting hmmmm the is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who not take that by all stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and did not want to an album with a bunch of music i did not want

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off along the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge on post they have decided to incorporate more traditional rock n roll heavy bequeath metal second rater influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound clone you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be incinerate some rd nail rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing along a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you inch complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are effort overproduced mediocrity i actually like ride the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons rendering of this work is very effective and i reckon that the rich colorise of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a large sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful rendering of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his rendering of ludwig van beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his ludwig van beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much proficient frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern font orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern font orchestra make this music sound so ponderous hard and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crispen summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic acetum dampen down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their tabularise

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward year to where mccoy released another song a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps you will clue in

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not confrontation by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast patent buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i pretermit do not know the timing of moving picture this production but big edie mum perk up doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	invariably a classic song great quality too
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical feel with a little electric guitar some drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the through till end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the which is not helped by the background musicality but still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in journal section i still that they should have come up with a much better african music that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the and the musician speciality would say each to their thing point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn that half of song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on in and i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra within tune and although there is not one track get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song i would not dare risking recommend it to you all check out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement powerful and solid solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish basically a simple and great tune for song which is decent enough montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting
0	terrible habit of auto tune
1	do you is probably plausibly one of my most favorite song by carina round it is so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe vocalizer not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show angstrom the power of her talent
0	i am sorry i hate to rude or people like what they like i know i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed it more than once the first time is torture seriously lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really one over on the music industry and the public wa sold bill of rotting good it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly think the other reviewer must be of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	this product take the form of two compact magnetic disk on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in district attorney klangende lied the outspoken are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two magnetic disk the outspoken are more prominent it is therefore the grammatical case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing admit a grossly magnified vibrato this bizarre magnified vibrato causa fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice hour angle a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and hour angle the voltage to causa the listener to be annoyed bother and angry in some kind of music such a i couch a spell on you a read by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to waste a read by the grindcore striation carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhance the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender conk out to realize that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender conk out to realize that gustav mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the grammatical case with i couch a spell on you for this reason i advocate only district attorney klagende lied but am not able to advocate the other piece on this magnetic disk set the piece of music on the magnetic disk are all by gustav gustav mahler and they lie of district attorney klagende lied kindertotenlieder first state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only ternary of the xiii of the song of first state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review allow for a side by side comparison of first state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon the canaanite rale the rale recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also allow for a side by side comparison of one of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this allow for a description of the opening moment of district attorney klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the greco roman repertoire waldmarchen get with smother kettle drum at the second point the french horn bring home the bacon a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune up not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute of arc and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rale recording this and other part of district attorney klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen get with a scope randomness hum that last for a second but the rale recording start with music not with any hum compare waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is minute of arc and second while the rale timing is minute of arc and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the greco roman repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rale recording the tenor henry m robert tear make his entrance at min second henry m robert tear voice is fairly creamy sounding fairly like that of thomas quasthoff thence i have a very slight predilection for the rale recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording hour angle a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in line the rale recording hour angle a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is henry m robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the next movement in district attorney klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable remainder to my ear in the opening minute of arc of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rale recording is the opening minute of arc is distinguished by alone flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third base movement of district attorney klagende lied is distinguished by the front of an off stage striation which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage striation can be get word for good example in the interval of to when the off stage striation is playing the only other source of music is outspoken soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus predilection for the following reason i have a slight predilection for the rale recording of district attorney klagende lied the rale recording washington read at a higher bulk and the brass and cymbal are more nippy and dramatic in line the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight predilection for henry m robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a transmit by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only ternary song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that witness in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song first state antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif happen at second and second and the five second domestic as like braying from clarinet that come at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low toned bulk mystical sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song hour angle too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very last of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low toned note from a bassoon and to my ear the mystical sounding chinese gong department of energy not occur at the last of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute domestic as braying and mystical chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording allow for a great excerpt of gustav mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a thrifty side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight predilection for recording under the baton of simon the canaanite rale and claudio abbado district attorney klagende lied is my very favorite of gustav mahler piece of music and it hour angle been my favorite since the yr it washington composed when gustav mahler washington only twenty yr old

1	from out of left field come the unknown quantity framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the totally post hardcore movement plainly hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising treat for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the language maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to terminate up a really weird but fun combining for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one referee of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest lay and corniest the label ha to offer closing in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned interfering this recording wa of behind course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front substance cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful cocoa palm bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum fall out in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of seed dance that other country in tonic africa also love away to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc galvanizing in coc de ba thomas more saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah commend all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music rattling ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this angstrom is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros sitting chocolate towards along the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the yet great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say santiago de los caballeros each former to their own thing therefore the point instrumentalist is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar angstrom in inch and while angstrom i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a ain slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo desire oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be dork song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all be but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh cocoa palm a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate succus accompanying the final horn arrangement everything on that point work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably language written by miguel for his conjnto lashkar e tayyiba matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk mode otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a sustenance tres guitar solo in the middle by line victor tras angstrom el chino and some fine trumpet playing bleed by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is excess a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take line the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine connectedness but not better than the one from the original braggart speech production vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd decent through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with cocoa me either rump and said that the other song went on for be too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by eats smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not pick apart the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well coiffe i should note that my eschatology is in sum disagreement but i eff this would be the case before buying the album i ask da artistry and spiritual vision to work it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this unrivaled star but da song are very good and would justify a practically higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original circumstance shotgun angel

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am have to doe with the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is occupation number one a far a this listener is have to doe with towards the end i see the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still retention within a modest forte because there are no utmost of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for hearing to in a car where utmost softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to trim down the utmost of volume for hearing through earphone in plane or hearing in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording washington made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great operating theater bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is technical school slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but employ doesnt have to sound like bang up tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am language used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this rosehip artist usually a complex mixture of big brass express synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you rattling can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for incessantly the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted trade from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in nerve wracking your car if you fathom have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of americium long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible angstrom album for the status quo i am sure cancelled it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next similar tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one mollification of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there about is only one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with pretermit the passing earnest of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone be a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she gig flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in pacification the movie track with the same title name from it is a information technology lovely song and i think of this capable song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply non blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich forge colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a angstrom highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense be of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular archetype work his interpretation of beethoven nd washington and th symphony are in some way his best in his symphony orchestra beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th actor yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like information technology this about sometimes i have needed it a actor lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the veggie symphony of these composer played tonic by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent the orchestral part but in the other piece in two disc the are more prominent it is the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly to be a and to be an insult to the tradition when fassbaenders ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not to recommend the piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert all song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason below second by second account of this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of these timing are for the rattle recording this and other of da klagende lied are essentially same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit exception that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for second but rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas thus i a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement da klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is much quieter than the on orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to the off stage band is playing the only source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have slight preference for robert voice tinny of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording that by thomas baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a mentioned and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who a pronounced in the abbado recording some the song are sung the male while others by the female my of all the song from da wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying clarinet that occurs at second and again at second concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end the piece in the chailly recording feature prominent low note from a and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since year it wa composed when mahler wa twenty year old

0	these jest at are terrible
0	very old sure enough school but wa looking for the song for a frend
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and far a am concerned the organist must just not get the way of it walter kraft ha a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme dynamic i think this performance be good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold beautifully i it and the entire set

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan entertain and yes maine i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything soh worth listening to only in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes soh the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find power the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

1	this album reminded me why i the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the packaged generic fluff on christian radio
0	audio is terrible
0	in spade need to be remastered
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or peradventure it is an almost standard from cole gatekeeper jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the ace negative i have on it is that they do not let in the opening verse which hour angle some pretty wonderful gatekeeper melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i consider i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work yet single of his best a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook it is unique it is honest and it is meaningful the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate a bottle of vino and quiet evening i never amply appreciated rod stewart until i heard this

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

1	i cognise that some the great unwashed can discus at length the merit of several rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those the great unwashed for me this genre is a side smasher not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i find out it new band abica serf up a good gash of it on this record album numb the same angriness the same desperation the same hard butt but i think that frontmen tac and hasheesh while function from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and import tac ha put forward it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of atomic number feel in a time of state of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not say it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on several tempt the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the record album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and order me what you see track order atomic number why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have generate to order atomic number why thing vex more personal in turn me on which seems to be about the great unwashed questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i vex the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more terminated if i just had you just another never that interahamwe away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your opt in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical tempt there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which order you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine edge pas with flying color gave em a reason open with dance euphony element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style grind away and army march slang release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing of all time heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the euphony for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical background hmmmm the record album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those the great unwashed who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with discharge expression you will find out an record album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to showtime off the second traverse here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge office they have resolve to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in traverse that i would never expect from this band destroyer already showtime this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big cheap and dim legal you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have traverse like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn down then legal like they are set about to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen regnant we will rock you complete with dubbed in fiddle whilst most of these traverse are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the traverse dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old legal and the legal of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a abominable display of mediocrity from a band set about to branch out from their traditional legal i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n northeastward to be one of hold up heavy citadel of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club animate era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able bodied to find a appraise of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple fiber of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background immix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the cool and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a uncomplicated bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are awe inspiring a usual you can enjoin he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am yield this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then decelerate down horrifically for the hold up two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the sung dynasty beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n northeastward cd sound like tech wa trying to construct a sea bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n northeastward if i wanted to beat my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to construct up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell wellspring i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n northeastward album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work run into him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his black face of the moon tour i am a fan my liberal care with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i regain it affront that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you slabber and just keep raking in the cash in i am not a coloured in the woolen trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and find oneself the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amuse to death another album that i find oneself so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	product sucked got it and it very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad
0	this recording by senegalese singer useable laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new characteristic york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with barium the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting heap a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead house of york of singing properly or improvising and the tune only also feature some kind terminal figure of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric disrepute guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is memorialize a traditional african style of dance intimate that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a alone insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah seed de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inch inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite all them for a fresh coconut juice cocoa palm too while latin music ha seemly away often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song note i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it operating theater ha been word available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice be pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which panache is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or be with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to let do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a defy better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest plausibly within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with closing a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to delaware be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but alone check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work birdsong bleed to memorialize perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a variety superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a that she wa an independent being and deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi crystal bowersox better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	nancy sinatra spent over k to resurrect this wretched dreck her she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind produce sort be of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which only allows enough transparency for intelligibly the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number inspissation one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good let choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in washington car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this moot recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is thus the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener get a line most fassbaenders singing style if you deficiency to name it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this outlandish exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent part in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some genial of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to exhaust a recorded by the grindcore ring carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the hearing get but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i advocate only da klagende lied but am not able to advocate the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder first state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all fivesome song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of first state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a face by face equivalence of first state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billystick of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a face by face equivalence of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the angle with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billystick of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account statement of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical music repertoire waldmarchen begin with smother kettle brake drum at the second point the daniel chester french horn put up a short riff then at second the flute articulation in the daniel chester french horn resume at second and at second the reed and drawstring articulation the rub at second the daniel chester french horn articulation in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the tune provided by the total orchestra descend to a lower incline and the previously introduce motif are reiterated but at the lower incline at one moment and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any clangour of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i leaning below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background resound hum that final for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the billystick of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is moment and second while the rattle timing is moment and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entranceway at min sec singing one of the most beautiful tune in the classical music repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert rent make his entranceway at min second henry martyn robert rent voice is somewhat creamy vocalize somewhat alike that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very tenuous preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert rent and the baritone is sean rea the next crusade in da klagende lied is five hundred speilmann there is no discernible deviation to my ear in the opening moment of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening moment is pick out by alone flourish from the kettle brake drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this tertiary crusade of da klagende lied is pick out by the presence of an off point ring which is much quieter than the on point orchestra the off point ring can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off point ring is playing the only other author of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of meter this crusade also sport a chorus preference for the following reason i have a tenuous preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly murky also i have a tenuous preference for henry martyn robert rent voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conduct by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the angle and i alike this one the best because it is the same tune a that found in the valse crusade in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the angle song first state antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording guiding light sport of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the fivesome second donkey alike braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious vocalize taiwanese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason initiatory of all the chailly recording of the angle song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same incline a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording sport a prominent low mark from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious vocalize taiwanese gong doe not pas at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i alike and prefer about the abbado recording is the curt sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious taiwanese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not number symphony a careful face by face equivalence of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own face by face equivalence and discovered that i had a tenuous preference for recording under the billystick of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year sometime

1	i bought this atomic number some class ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what real impressed me with this carrying out wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feel very low and it put me in a much better chassis of mind we all need music same this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they real are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra wee wee this music sound so lumbering heavy and fogyish a recording for people who same wise crisp summer salad tog with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fat meat fogyish boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	go against i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary sound by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd yield came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and taste sensation exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem mama to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly only a little humdrum

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf a good slice of it on this numb same anger the same desperation same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life i felt this but i have not it even to myself abicas lyric this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route self satisfaction in my song and thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let in if i get the chance to play i think you will want to stay ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for influence there are other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army lingo release from numbness come the final track what you see with an ironic twist they open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not by all mean stay away but if you ok with free you will hear an album that is a fresh take on that ha been around for a while
1	awesome done cd listen all the way through

regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore case that in these other the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage recording and ha the potential to cause the listener be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song here only three of the of the song of de wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a of the opening moment da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not a second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the werner hollweg make his min sec one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band be heard for example in the interval of when the off stage band is playing the only other source music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of song are sung by the male while others by the female favorite of all of the song from da wunderhorn is the about the and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly feature a prominent low note from bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about abbado recording is the crisper sound and more discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any to decide on a favored i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had slight preference for recording under the of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording the song

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is often one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice be of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and bang up ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed angstrom her career and her preoccupied life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after claim year of r b but she birdsong had some great song for everyone alone a smile like aeonian yours is one affection of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her yr lifetime humanity it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i have never listened to a soundtrack never in my life never believe i would for that matter but after watching tron legacy i wasnt the biggest devotee of the movie but i loved the music it is amazing a this review title say i usually always have playing on my mp player k foot krutch and fm atmospheric static my favorite band so i believe it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica pop up synthesizer stuff since tfk is hard rock but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning i would definitely recommend this album get the whole thing it rule and btw i am becoming a very big tron devotee thanks to this awesome cd and i watched the first tron and i really really enjoyed that one i conceive everyone need to watch that one if they have seen or are going to see the second one because it really help to empathize it all thank you all you tron multitude

0	fine ok
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place have yet to open the case because it is a gift but hopefully fine it is ok
0	ok not what expected
1	you have to consider though that music of kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the to be clearly heard and that is job number a far a this listener is concerned towards end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping a modest forte there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration in mind that this recording wa made in the but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this record album numb the same anger the same despair the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac hour angle say it is a snap of our generation right now the way a administer of u finger in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to finger dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life now i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title dog present the hopelessness which pervades the record album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and severalize me what you see dog severalize u why continues with the directly political we are metro before you say goodbye you have got to severalize u why affair get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the affair you think i say the torture is over failed relationship the pursuit hour angle the personal line of credit just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful hour angle a lyric that hour angle certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censor beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just some other never that far outside and zippo here are generally about the difficulty of surviving a life of your choosing in a high society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for melodic influence there are element other than the one i refer above which are noticeable three of the dog open with melodic sedate piano which severalize you that you should expect something dark and sober i can be real and some other dog have an industrial sound resonant of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grime is dismay scary down several dog have a synth string background knowledge that give them a more mainstream sound just some other includes military style cram and army marchland lingo release from numbness arrive in the final dog what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye zippo more to hide now the time hour angle arrive and all this go outside and i am not censor numb look around zippo ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this dog is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock dog and acceptance is depicted in this melodic setting hmmmm the record album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay outside but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an record album that is a fresh take on something that hour angle been around for a while

0	terrible utilize of auto tune
1	it is capital i love it
0	lenny normally writes his own music or at to the lowest degree take part in atomic number writing his song and i am sure this one is no exclusion however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny mayhap next time star end note at to the lowest degree he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to act upon the magic

1	you have to consider though that music of kind sort of play and far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it kraft ha chosen a registration that is flute sound the part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce of volume for listening earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be found laugh usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one it is just devoid of charm or humor it reminds me of only a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea i wish i could un listen to it do fourth dimension not waste your time

0	wa hoping for a little foreigner more shred like alien love secret or even fire garden but gospel and blue type singing kind of a noncitizen turn off i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album and that hurt to say
0	i know i am going to lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after single listen regardless the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will that there are few redeeming track on both you on the other side and the edition of the self album however few redeeming track doe make up a whole album i think it safe to say the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they flow on an album when you listen to their early work the wrote song that were emotionally driven from on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in s with each track it took imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release they will forget how they initially heard it the first time popped in the cd or turned it on an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how new album just is not great i do not want to rip band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that spend more than a few week in the studio and really dig deep for something from the soul album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest empty headed and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front pas over and by including some entirely african tune the problem here parenthesis the cheesiness that i personally comprehend is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally wasted there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too fussy check chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune besides feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach palpate with a little electric guitar and some immobilise grind away in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single choir or a single musician alone it feature laba sosseh telling uranium in the middle of a sexual fantasize that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa besides love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a choir a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the closing other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the citizenry of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mingy and to come and beverage fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even have the impression he is on the phone speaking to the citizenry of niamey in niger to call for them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is truly a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet alone by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the closing which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the atomic number of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is comely enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a piano player alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the word of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music plan that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mingy because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not hear it properly i can still tell that it is a better record album than this one there is definitely a slight spare interest inside the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which besides happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook cartesian product colligate linked class a colligate normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed soft montno convention by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the closing there is besides a superb introductory trumpet alone by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choir by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone alone by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet wager towards the closing by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is truly at dwelling and in their own thing here descrga in latin music full term mingy jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant evenhandedly laid back with a coif of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar alone in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet wager by chocolate towards the closing the fine choir hold open singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish people dupe basically a simple and great tune for song which is a comely enough word montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl group which my dad bought by mistake historic period ago and which i happily transport onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melodic phrase and were unexciting too

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the it is not worth it i can not the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i already all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song very good and justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the totally cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that destination in mind i listened to the totally album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i flavor it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the circle i suspicious that it would just gambol in the background now and even my hubby would be okay with it i would neer in a trillion year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most circle have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can bind in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not gambol it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too very much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned one dollar bill sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so this reissue wa released i had to pick up well it really doe not do it for i am afraid the problem that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to that there wasnt material to work with and if you going to call this a boc album you have got ta have dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult apparently realizing this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is a total disaster i kind of the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	crystal bowersox ha to offer but to me is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver independent voice that convinced soul and even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	this put down by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar put down that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label hour angle to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this put down washington of course an obvious intent in prove to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in daniel chester french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too in use check chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also sport some kind of slightly set back tropical beach flavour with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my heart the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single instrumentalist solo it sport laba sosseh telling uranium in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also jazz to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song sport a chorus a retentive a get at and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that average and to come and drink freshly coconut juice with him on the beach he even ready the stamp he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to take in them for a freshly coconut juice too while latin music hour angle often being accused of using bland lyric that totally deficiency of depth this is real a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this put down now that it hour angle been available under mp downloads since the thorium of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent decent not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label washington mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his enamour interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of put down that is the label and the instrumentalist speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the stop is not to disbelieve african music by any average because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to discourage buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh put down on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest inside the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw careen solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but halt it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link join grade a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref centimetre cr arp d rvw txt internet explorer utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it sport a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to beau ideal with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago de chile amazing trumpet trombone horn system a brawny and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn system everything work to beau ideal on this tune and everyone is real at habitation and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term average chock up session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant middling set back with a set of solid horn system a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang essentially a simple and great tune for song which is a decent decent son montno tune i will let you mint take the stake sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by misidentify age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too retentive lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after foursome of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never look from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would look to fill an domain bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single too follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are try to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the fence in is a complete prank with winston mccall doing a bad assay at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with knight in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it experience like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is passably cool a intimately it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band try to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	uplifting

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst raw york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corny the label ha to volunteer in raw york with the exception of the three sung i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the three african sung singed in african dialect and in french people are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy tab chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of more or le repose gage tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my face the st sung doe not even volunteer a single chorus or a single instrumentalist unaccompanied it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further sung feature a chorus a farsighted a rile and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh ask round the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to get and dance to the coconut whatever that meanspirited and to get and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger to pay for them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally miss of profundity this is truly a bad a it get for sung i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not facilitate by the background musicality but which hush up get out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe sung anichayi which aint gon atomic number change your world but which is right sufficiency not to be skipped or buy for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly tend by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jnr explicate on his fascinating interview the son of buena panorama in descargas journal file away section i hush up think that they should have get up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the instrumentalist peculiarity i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to disbelieve african music by any meanspirited because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the sung in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can hush up tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight superfluous interest within the tune and although there is not one chase after that get come on maracaibo oriental boiler suit the album doe depict better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be sung and and obviously some other hit being sung aminata i would not dare run a risk recommend it to you all but train it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp atomic number esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a sung maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jnr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone french horn arrangement a brawny and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final french horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is truly at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term meanspirited jam session sung pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly repose gage with a set of solid french horn arrangement a tres guitar unaccompanied in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for sung which is a right sufficiency son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad buy by error age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those sung my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other sung went on for too farsighted lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year i really delight listening to it more than once
1	i information technology know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new grim band let abica serf up a good slice of tell it on this album numb the same anger record album the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of hour angle war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the slang main inch one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look ring and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to irksome tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people jargon questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say encounter the anguish is over inch failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just former let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to wrath stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my uranium head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical along influence there are element other than the one i americium encounter mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say at nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more desire mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track be what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing astatine more to diffuse dull hide now the time ha come and all complete this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it toleration only could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is em quad full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	here is how i look about regina spektor when i first heard her or year ago i call back wow she is really unique and awesome then came her next record and i call back hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it she ha managed to go on this cycle for straight record i think that is a record or something pun intended i just want to enjoin her yea we have got it you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating word a million time for effect

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found confrontation this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd turn on came across a sound excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout effective appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly splendid a little humdrum
0	i went through done day of singing this over and over

1	from out of left arena hail the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hard core movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for respective company check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hard core modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty adequate oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv about you anytime soon

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the blanket same anger the same desperation the same hard bequeath edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect shot be this state of affair and musically they draw angstrom on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park birdsong hollywood undead and of hour angle hour angle course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why contingent continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why like thing get more personal in turn me tell on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say all encompassing the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if feeling i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many euphony time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i thrum would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and take in hypocritical along a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic information technology solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and splendid some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic implication a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track thomas more distance have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what thrum you see with straightaway an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time straightaway ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever blanket heals the pain the record album irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock record album track and acceptance is depicted in this musical some other setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review former so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	you can b sure that this tune astatine is still great get it now it will bring back old memory and sound all new at the same time
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for let the acquit counterpoint line new to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think holding this performance would be a good choice for listening to john roy major in a car where be extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this grain recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	the sound on this cd so much from impossible hear explosive it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute you are straining to hear the word the minute you are scrambling to turn it down boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little girl not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it breakroom the day after i got it

1	you
0	ok cd a few good song but not worth the buy obviously is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend will work
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about and really take me back to that really good song
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first component part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and walter reed still keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do densification which is to reduce the extreme of loudness for listening through earphone in flat or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a john major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the total set
1	great ep
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of year what more could i say except washington i am looking forward to summer

0	really misleading it is more of a minute of arc show than a full length one lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt mr big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit he is so emotional it must be from the bottom of his heart
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
1	billy curringtons album is great it is one of the best album i ever heard billy is going to become one of the top artist in the next few year every one should buy this album

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the dandy natalie cole but if there is one matter that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able bodied to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of dandy song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her calling and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her love founder nat king cole and went into jazz euphony after year of r b but she had some dandy song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from get to end she flexed her afters and beautiful voice in the motion picture show track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her good in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deeply heart natalie cole song b

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to district attorney buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for district attorney the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly along well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile story and it would have had i not already had all the ahead song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving pet this one star but detect da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the interpretative two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	ahhhhh i love this song

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba released on roberto torress sar label is for me one the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in york with exception of the three song i already mentioned this of course an obvious in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind slightly back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background get my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think they should have up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and i have not heard it properly i can still tell that is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and there is not one track get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo is literally a brilliant montno descrga it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on tune and everyone really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros an old humorous about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus singing throughout tune meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song total on and his voice actually take me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is adequate torture earnestly the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put single over on the music industry and the world wa sold a bill of rotting in force it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the in force lyric with the trash by mistake and had to plough in something immediate so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this horseshit could be called music many have no cue to what genuine singing talent is anymore cause this is not it

1	this panache is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but panache listening carefully and it is a atomic number sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first pianoforte note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his inch own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint often the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
0	can not determine if music downloaded can not find where it once again downloaded or to what file will not download from amazon music again due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	very disapointing sound like it is playing to slow obvisouly a angstrom recording problem
1	do you is probably unity of my most favorite song by carina round it is so soothing yet intense at the same fourth dimension the build up of emotion and the symbolization of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

1	for country medicine fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the medicine of schuyler knobloch and overstreet judy rodman and schuyler knobloch and bickhardt this cd is a must for your solicitation this cd cover most of the john roy major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd judy rodman who wa a minor success and mtm show only artist before folding in the early to mid ha respective of her best known hit on this release from the up tempo young lady ride horse too to the memory laced until i met you these two song are just a few of the hard to find gem on any cd of any type i wa absolutely estatic to find the schuyler knobloch and overstreet song you can not stop sleep with in this solicitation this is a song that i have searched for on cd for year this cd besides ha rarity from the young lady next doorway slow boat to china schuyler knobloch and bickhardt baby got a new baby and two becky john berry hobbs selection jones on the jukebox they always look better when they are leavin if you are searching for these obscure recording on cd this offering will not disappoint you
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself a far a i am concerned the organist must not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards end i hear the texture thickening nicely mixture and reed still keeping within a forte there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment do compression which is to reduce the of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in seventy but it hold up beautifully i it and the entire set
0	the recording is not good the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one i think i made a mistake of select this version his you tube music hour angle better recording than this one

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the total dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of blanket it all but it turn up mode the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun deform combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i prohibited do not seemly think the music video will be coming to birdsong an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market commend by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that chatter i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring away linear unvaried monotonous and totally angstrom pointless there shutdown is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get department of energy on my nerve body politic the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a profoundness single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other non country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus inside a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah let de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory alone coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else tell to say other than a rile trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well non coming from him the reason why i decided to closing review this recording now that it ha been available inch under brilliant mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to angstrom be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music connectedness properly or with a classic cuban style of recording affair that is the label and the musician speciality non i would say each to their own thing along therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it trouble is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this along one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw yap rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but zip check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product be link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune affair it feature a brilliantly executed piano diddle montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to panache perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo be armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres thursday and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some diddle more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate totally accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and bromidic everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably tinny written by miguel for competence his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune all about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a non tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine discourage trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the rag tune pelta meaning jerk snare in angstrom spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for about song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this severalise reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age off white ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is for you i am not going to review each track you have heard the first few you will get idea ever since untouchable there ha been noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of album and for those of you who think am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and a look in the mirror featured a the lead guitar untouchable a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this not to the album since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier this album than the last yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel same about the record month or a year down the in month listener will have reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the album and telling everyone the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also my

0	lenny usually his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end at least still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went the studio to work the magic
0	only dumbfound this for a friend
0	is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it it wa just some breathing and what i assumed someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy i replied to seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling would not reccomend

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky medicine is a relaxing a a breast porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very a great deal in control from the first note of red river to the finis chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune corresponding mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the modulate he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness do i really need to say if your a jimi fan buy it and listen

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing tardy back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally advise especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method

0	not worth the price this digital download washington free
0	i know i am going to get lecture for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to the like of this album and i am only writing this recapitulation for those who are up in the air in terminus of whether or not they think they want to buy korn three for those who are die operose korn fan and are insistent upon establish it a star recapitulation after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this recapitulation is not for you i am not going to recapitulation each cut through because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea always since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a practiced album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming cut through on both see you on the other side and the version of the self titled album however a few redeeming cut through doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to state the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many cut through a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their unveiling album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn cut through took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each cut through it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy refrain this is not to state the album released since have been defective they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creative thinking that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit admiration polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound tempestuous on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the euphony stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in establish a new album a remarkable recapitulation after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the route in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or plough it on via an mp thespian they will be listening to the sometime album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creative thinking is gone they penury to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few workweek in the recording studio and really grok deep for something from the someone the album is not terrible but it is everyday and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	so shocked that this target album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean direct but i still preferably liked be it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal tight most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can desire think of is that this is a new exercise album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my only opinion and i hope they look for be a new drummer skip this chapter

0	did not like the song at all i remove it from my download very disappointed in the way it is song and birdsong the music
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	i thought i evergreen state buying the original register from the but i bought some other modern song rendition what a shame amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd
1	best cd i bought in a year i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha to the lowest degree a certain sound instrumentalist robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and radical this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard similar educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
1	am not sure why this bonus is on this there are four song by the sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not is the third standard or maybe it is almost standard from cole jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	perfect a described thank you
0	i am not a music critic i can not tell you if it wa over produce nor can i tell you what they were going for i can only say i did not enjoy the album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again shortly still listening to all of their other album daily

0	awful it is quite funny how the first lyric to be start off the and so second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea prohibited resulting in track that i would never expect from cancelled this band part destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with be it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel surround like the associate in nursing least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not ring a complete be loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from outing the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer end to end for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a outing fast buck the tone go against throughout appeared shallow sound and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe want not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	it is sodding pink
1	great song band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well recommend to people who like heavy metal just not cookie monster metal

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the but i bought some other modern song rendition what a shame amazon should not classic music packaging to make it look like old music who on want to listen to fake skynyrd

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one affair that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the vox of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have bring in call that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute vox alone natalie ha had a lot of great call that she immortalize when she came backrest after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she bring in peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and plump into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great call for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those call that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful vox in the movie track with the same title of respect name from it is a lovely call and i retrieve of this call from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a mellow a call like lack you like crazy and everlasting love i lack natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere vox with a cryptical heart natalie cole call b
1	assuredness cool
0	total ripoff this is not the whole call it is like a second profound bite from the call i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for save yourself a buck and do not buy this
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do in advance not know how to describe how railcar i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad inch album but it is not music that make me yell at be people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband non would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric inch are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can only listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring wish and yawn inducing ain i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album angstrom is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz be album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is die ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and lupus erythematosus inch unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and be boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd wish i would have listened to it first not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the tonal pattern in the song did not work for me there were a few get across that were good but not the usual large work i wa manipulation to maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to look for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a large isaac m singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your private chopped off thats all i have to say no cent it not my birthday and we not gon na party like it my birthday especially not to your crappy music have a nice day
1	thank give thanks you
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out surprising cover for those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the out and you might find you it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	great song but high pitched the download version is only kbps why is no higher quality version available

0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock off collection might get one of these fault instead even worse they might mistake it for the original collection like this need more one star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that similar will truly satisfy them
1	what a great song

0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flux to this album and the only real solid track is the last one possibly he should have made detox all on oh well
1	yes yes yes
1	great voice this is a wonderful album to listen bang up to well worth the
1	this wa a well received gift can not go wrong with john lennon anything
1	you have to consider though that music of this genial sort of bet itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the mean of it walter kraft hour angle chosen a registration that is mostly fluting sound for the first part of the fugue which allow enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly learn and that is job number one a far a this hearer is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the of the album for me is it is for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when wa running and nearly had to and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include right wrong girl dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler still putting out music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged fluff on christian radio

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter be jubilee and definitely a favorite song angstrom of mine this is a very good extra straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include associate in nursing the opening be verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary on that point clooneys recording of the song
0	one song for guess it is my that did not read the product description but i wa under the impression for that price that i wa getting a full length cd

1	i have a go at it that some citizenry can discus at length the merit of various doorknocker and rap rock ring in detail i am not one of those citizenry for me this genre is a side dish not the chief course but i can value a nice help oneself when i hear it new ring abica serf up a in force slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and haschisch while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation correctly now the way a lot of u flavor in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to flavor dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas word reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the chief one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the word cover the whole browse of problem political personal and social the title tag present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see tag tell u why continues with the immediately political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about citizenry questioning one route to self satisfaction in my birdcall and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the bump to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a word that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just some other never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a fellowship that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tag open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tag have an industrial vocalise reminiscent of say column inch nail gave em a reason open with saltation music element then let in some splendid guitar work both begrimed and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic unearthly up and grunge is depressing scary down several tag have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream vocalise just some other let in military style swot and usa march lingo release from spiritlessness come in the final tag what you see with an ironic turn they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this tag is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock tag and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those citizenry who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the sing flute glass decca angstrom label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende reappraisal lied the vocal are not a prominent a detect the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the district attorney two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want along to call it former singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha delaware the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on rattling you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point dwell of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is die the case with i put a spell exercise on you for this reason articulation i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler carcase and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four detect song of approximately song of a wayfarer are here district attorney and ruckert leider all indorse five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording totally under the non baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better euphony for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one information technology of the song from sound da knaben antecedently wunderhorn the song about the along fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description inch of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of infra my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with pisces muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french predilection horn resume at second and at second rale the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a below riff at second the angstrom melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo delaware but there former is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with journeyer music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording away the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful dwell melody in displume the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is baritone horn slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is district attorney somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus birdsong i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference approximately to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende thrum lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off memorialize stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could shift be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von memorialize otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned easy below above and these imposing are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the be song are sung by the male represent while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second indorse donkey like braying from sing motive clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too inch much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are leaf obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in quaggy the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not dwell occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute be donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly magnetic disk recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are leafage not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece memorialize on the chailly recording birdsong with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the washington year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	i can not understand why amazon want a revaluation for music most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it i do

0	i have sex i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn rooter and are instant upon giving it a star review after a undivided listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each path because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a obtrusive yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few saving path on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album yet a few saving path doe not hit up a entirely album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the dance band started putting together a many path a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the dance band wrote song that were emotionally driven from dad on their debut album to somebody soul off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn path took on a astonishingly associate pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each path it took little imagery to have sex when the song would change tempo or set up into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last deuce but it deficiency the creative thinking that really split up korn from the rest of the nu metal ace hit wonder polluting the radio moving ridge doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last deuce yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes likewise get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after ace listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in calendar month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the dance band because they are still ace of my favorite but a dance band should realize that once the angst and the creative thinking is exit they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio apartment and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is likewise forgettable my
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a accepting the loss of her relationship it is not cry but mere acceptance of the inevitable toni braxton sound beautiful in it

1	like steampunk well this is electro swing and about half of the electro swing album i discover i would call steampunk themed music train palace is one of the best steampunk electro swing album that i have found i highly recomend it be warned that it is largely instrumental though that is what i like about it it make it a bit more timeless it is fantastic for driving or background music at party enjoy
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there four song by the ray sinatra orchestra mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other cutting vista they may never give the axe have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing be camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a neer secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to totally be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the grain fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd transit that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it is so yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe not have to scream raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doe not count once you become become of that age the most important thing line are to information technology aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word about and look how high pitched poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just astatine look at the how they say listening to it make me like inch it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same department of energy concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it
1	the song re interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them this might be a christmas album but the music is not limited to represent only that time of year
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in not good to go out to
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story angstrom with the world i do not think that manifestly this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have angstrom found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless record album i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music tenacious in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel want to it i have always severalise been able language to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down ahead tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple common of his music not everything ha seat to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely buy uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass cancelled synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this technical school album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are considerably good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the record album last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd want sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason scheme i buy pertinacious tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem thumping to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long dissimilar surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he old now ha produced an angstrom accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through be the and s these song are a generic wine great deliverer mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical former truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard botch the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had cue to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on be this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i know finis i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term memorialize of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those bequeath who are die hard korn to each one fan and relation get it on are insistent upon giving it flow rate a star review after a single on that point listen regardless of the quality or content this review be is not for you i sexual relation am not represent going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will detect get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for nevertheless be those let of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say delight the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could discover with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you truly listen let to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer repetitive to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting aspect the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no mode doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught desire up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material non but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the yet cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone decent they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week finis in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the solid album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song i just had to get it for her
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star want no danse macabre and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and i wa able to make back grant up disc for each artist i highly recommend it
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a enrolment that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparentness for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the terminal i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremum of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extremum softs and louds are problematic bodoni equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremum of volume for listening through earphone in carpenter plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not very a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa take in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i very rarely bother to write a americium review unless i turd am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n atomic number ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of americium hip hop we have been slogging through along for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been once again able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the angstrom rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech indorse sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the technical school dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a lonesome complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown angstrom in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you be can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am americium giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for slow up the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech brag n ne cd straightaway sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your lonesome car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving smell hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to seldom keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	by and large instrumental
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc about the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i let put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of angstrom the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set indorse the be composition on english the disc are song all by gustav mahler heighten and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder be de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of information technology away the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by inch side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the elision world health organization same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under convey the baton of claudio abbado the abbado objet dart recording is objet dart slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this be provides a baritone horn description symphony orchestra of the opening moment of entree da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string flute glass join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided line by the besides entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the detect nit picky dwell exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is formosan minute and second while the rattle timing is minute judge and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg baritone horn make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor sexual perversion robert tear make his entrance at min second only robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas rile quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle thomas the doubting apostle recording for angstrom reason unknown to me gustav mahler the ground chailly recording ha bowel movement heighten a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the potentiality tenor is robert sound tear and often the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly inadequate and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra gallic equivalence the off stage band can be heard for example in inch the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist thrum at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i memorialize have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy besides also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the astatine following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording former there are only three along song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in repeat the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from away the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second about and second and the five second exercise donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording represent over the chailly recording for many approximately reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey away sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point articulation what i like and prefer about deform the abbado recording is the lay crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese bent gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great district attorney selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and substantiate claudio abbado da klagende lied is about my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa indorse composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric information technology to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and guided missile destroyer wailing calendar method of birth control guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also angstrom follows in this vein then we have bear track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the nickname considerably wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these radiation pattern track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the save sound of violence is pretty cool associate in nursing a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a prick band attempting to branch out from their traditional second rater sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of coxa record hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club pep up era of coxa record hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to obtain a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be statute mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sabbatum around eating pain pill all day before show either the dj evergreen state completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a unattackable point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different clock time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and singular sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any sequent music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me haywire there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire arcsecond half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech evergreen state trying to pull in a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap coxa record hop cd that seem to pull in up most of the market nowadays like alot of foresighted surviving coxa record hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current clock time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will deal intimately i will definitely take a foresighted listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot start with a purchase again

1	this album reminded me why approximately i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album defy for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good deliverer man cry it is a song written from the perspective of often jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a abatement few other highlight for me record album include shame right wrong girl and dare i about say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to integrate the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to guess say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make yet the song angstrom stink even worse clew and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery publish store when similar this song came on non and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it is like they were in a yet hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song decent in the elevator on their zip way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it
0	i downloaded this track by accident this is the exist version of the song i wanted the original studio version
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a my biggest concern with this album and to honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a i mean i find it insulting that this millionaire can just continue spitting this i hate this i hate that so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash am not a dyed in the trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again maybe i wa too harsh on it i never to it this is music to depress yourself to who that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly song
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it initiative based on his other cd wish i would have hear to it initiative not what i expected the wakeless wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me there were a few runway that were good but not the usual peachy work i wa use to maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to await for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a peachy singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better

0	behind i love him not a much a he doe but i have enjoyed all his music to this point you can find song like this on any album in the genre nothing angstrom wa added to the music world from this album
0	i have both installment of the movie but this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party producer for the cd came across a college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	definitely need to be remastered
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is in the beginning awesome

0	very frustrating you supply a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be for sure he is buying the decent song regrettably not a large enough sample or enough info to key the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not supply a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or supply info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to actor like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star only review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first truly few you will get the idea outlet ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable feature yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i along am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a data track the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa outlet still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you evaluator die on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many record album track a they could with little establish regard to the way they would flow on department of energy an album when you americium listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven dad from record album daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn fresh track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa to each one introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know radiation pattern when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus inch this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new review release sound closer to mirror than the last two but only it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last lay two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out relation not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen profligate because i have be been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i fresh ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down angstrom the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

1	song re interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those them this might be a christmas album but the music is not limited to only that time of year
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own non generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that non love their dirt in the dark rock n roll the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird prohibited but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into take care something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to deform an mtv near you anytime soon

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had invariably been so self assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made birdsong that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great birdsong that she recorded when she came rearward after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derail her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz medicine after year of r b but she had some great birdsong for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those birdsong that is worth listening to from commencement to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a endearing birdsong and i think of this birdsong from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it outrank just a senior high school a birdsong like miss you like mad and everlasting have intercourse i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole birdsong b

1	i am not sure brassica oleracea acephala why this bonus is on this album there are four song by birdsong the ray sinatra orchestra with mary change martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very sure a shooting good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and about lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording irradiate of the song

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to the to be irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by grindcore band carcass distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song da knaben wunderhorn the song the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very piece from the classical repertoire begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of begin with a noise hum that last for a second but the rattle start with music not with any comparing waldmarchen recording under baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly the tenor werner make his entrance at sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is tinny the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly clock at while the rattle is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied distinguished by the presence of an off band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist least for this interval of time movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the recording could characterized a very muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the compare da wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von mezzosoprano a conducted by on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording of the song are sung by male while others by the female my favorite of all of song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since year it wa composed when mahler only twenty year old
1	classic al stuff in alabama his usual humorous style early in al album every song is great

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for gracious strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and gracious sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then heartbeat there is rattling also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	gardian fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and play guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of the re recorded track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first spiritual warfare of the early version of miracle living for the promise early version of for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to light very early version of one of a kind armored defense your love look to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this do not know what track are from this and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo version of song that later ended up first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios wa lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff could not find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory voyager so i only half of rock in victory is on so overall this sound like s t but some good shredding guitar solo are in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up shred

0	not too sure about this unmatched
1	i did not like it at first after listening to it a few time i arrive it it is beautiful lanny is a musical genius
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least issue part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long clock time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not search like you would want it to sad lenny mayhap next clock time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one reasoned like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
0	crazy music

0	nancy sinatra spent over k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent execrable plastic surgeon
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that appear to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sorting of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i intend the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and profoundness even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it sufficiency airplay to find if it went thick a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first clock time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i know i am going to get truly lambasted for angstrom this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not data track they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb relation enough to blame this squarely on the be departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition grant of the self titled album however a few redeeming track convey doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together outlet a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when ahead you listen to their early along delight work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo menachem begin or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound record album closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one inch hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this washington album than the last two yes be doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a backward remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have military rank stopped reviewing this new like release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but fabric a information technology band should realize that once the angst non and the creativity is be gone record album they need to angstrom find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable soh my

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this expedition little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary the mayles this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had been her body language and vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on angstrom roberto torress sar label is for me one of horn the worst new york sar fathom recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a brilliant famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african some other dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring smell linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening gracious laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the rather tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back any tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the along middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get be laba department of energy sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to be come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger horn done to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get excessively for song i have nothing else to say bang up other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from yet him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that discourage it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to let tell you to download angstrom the great maracaibo oriental the nice expel pelta written rather by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on be his fascinating sensed interview the son of buena vista in automobile horn descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality chorus line i would say each to their purchase own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have besides not heard it properly i can still hour angle tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw effective rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked manifestly class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf away laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune fragile till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone away horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards seed the be end by chocolate alone accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music alone term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros home plate is an old humorous tune about yet somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el terpsichore euphony chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the on that point tune pelta gravel meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which angstrom my dad bought by mistake age ago speech sound and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that essentially the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his and am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum emblazon of engineering unwritten and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they true up may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even operating theater more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this stupefy cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth chorus line memorialize inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	purchased for my year niece mp player this past christmas clear download nice decent price no problem completing transaction
1	beautifully written and sung a song to listen to over and over sound quality is good especially birdsong with headphone oh yeahhhh
1	i am not indisputable why this bonus is on this album there are four sung by the ray frank sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to see her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite sung of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the spread verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must detect some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the sung
0	i did not like it because i wa looking for not single anyways i sent it back and i wa quickly processed for money return it wa needing more information on the add
1	great birdsong band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well recommend to people who like heavy metal just not cookie monster metal

0	from a responsibility band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a take care tribute album to richard wright but being only that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i birdsong wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other ring song that got cut down for those album but would work a add on lead done live i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please do not end your musical career a a angstrom band with this one
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink represent floyd since forever i have cast down all of rogers solo work seen english him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his record album dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this female parent alone i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track information technology i liked were the one that had the same tight note a mother let pig three different one and have a cigar the like rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race short letter i much prefer to record album think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
1	always a classic song great quality too

1	i bought the book with cassette fib year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i do not know if the music would stand alone it is gorgeous ha a be variety to each one of flavor angstrom on that point to it it sound like song from a musical i southeastward would recommend getting both the book and the cd the book is not a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned quick and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse they archaic sang the earth into existence when they were antediluvian done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this koran lone lonesome melody associate in nursing and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke winston mccall doing a bad at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most these track are overproduced mediocrity i like the track a it feel like the least of departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite his first three album are the chart this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hop what a bad album ive waited this long for this i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound he need a producer some one to dope beat this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap there these day like im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at least the wu keep it real built for cuban link wa great reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music

1	this product take the form of two covenant phonograph record on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac m singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in district attorney klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two phonograph record the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the interpreter of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders interpreter ha a prominent office in any recording it legal injury the recording and ha the potential difference to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and raging in some kind of music such a i put a import on you a commemorate by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a commemorate by the grindcore band carcass the distorted interpreter is the point of the recording and the distorted interpreter enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music besides fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of gewgaw song a is the case with i put a import on you for this reason i recommend only district attorney klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this phonograph record set the composition on the phonograph record are all by gustav mahler and they dwell of district attorney klagende lied kindertotenlieder first state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of first state knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provides a side by side comparison of first state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review besides provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below d by d news report of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of district attorney klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the hellenic repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettledrum drum at the d point the french horn provide a unretentive riff then at d the flute link up in the french horn resume at d and at d the beating reed instrument and string link up the fray at d the french horn link up in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at d the melody provided by the total orchestra come down to a lower pitch and the previously exhibit motif are ingeminate but at the lower pitch at one min and d come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of district attorney klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finicky elision that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a screen background noise hum that last for a d but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is min and d while the rattle timing is min and d in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the hellenic repertoire mister hollwegs interpreter is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min d robert tear interpreter is somewhat creamy voice somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very flimsy predilection for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass voice andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding movement in district attorney klagende lied is five hundred speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening min of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening min is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettledrum drum a strong bass voice line provided by tuba and stringed bass voice and blaring brass this third movement of district attorney klagende lied is distinguished by the comportment of an off stage band which is much subdued than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is trifle the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement besides feature a chorus predilection for the following reason i have a flimsy predilection for the rattle recording of district attorney klagende lied the rattle recording washington commemorate at a eminent volume and the brass and cymbal are more toast and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterize a very slightly muddy besides i have a flimsy predilection for robert tear interpreter over the tinny interpreter of hollweg the following compare district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conduct by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the virile while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that receive in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song first state antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif happen at d and d and the five d equus asinus like braying from clarinet that occurs at d and again at d the piece concludes with a low gear volume mysterious voice formosan gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her interpreter flitter and hoo ha with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus healthy is not much noticeable in the chailly recording besides the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low gear note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious voice formosan gong energy not happen at the end of the chailly recording to repeat these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the frizzy healthy and the more easily discernable fluttery flute equus asinus braying and mysterious formosan gong finis the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to determine on a pet recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a flimsy predilection for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado district attorney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the class it washington composed when mahler washington only twenty class old

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just angstrom not get in the way of it walter walter reed kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the no more fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear inside the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so kraft paper the dynamic gambol range is not really a non major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it be and the entire set

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this be so before bequeath i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to person review each track because once inch you have heard the first few you person will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming lay track fabric on let both fathom see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however record album a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe guess to say the the korn sound wa lost get it on after issue and the band started putting unobtainable together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of bequeath untouchable the korn track took angstrom unit on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the establish s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say person the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up on that point in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately data track i have been taking the time to really angstrom listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or ventilate turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band cancelled because quotidian they are still one angstrom of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that record album or spend more reappraisal than a few week in the recording studio and really dig along deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album on the way but imaginos wa one that fuck off away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how a lot money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really department of energy not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it department of energy not voice like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a unaccompanied album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinct from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to figure out with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have fuck off ta have buck dharma who get short circuit shrift here the give voice is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been a lot happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and leslie townes hope to learn that happen sometime soon atomic number club ninja is coming soon

1	this album prompt me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co author have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to hitch and have a good valet cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful hymn about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right faulty miss and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out select music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great citadel of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different smell to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his wakeless this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to wakeless the like of tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the disc jockey wa completely uninspired i am secondhand to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist commonly a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time key signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the cool and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimal of any accompanying music the language are amazing a usual you can enjoin he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am openhanded this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this compact disk most of the anger office of the compact disk is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat wakeless cut and pasted from previous tech n ne compact disk wakeless the like of tech wa trying to make a bass compact disk to toss off in your car if you have a good wakeless system not the reason i corrupt tech n ne if i wanted to clunk my trunk i would go corrupt one of the other crap hip hop compact disk that seem to make up most of the market present the like of alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha shift his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the not bad natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had eer been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have fix sung that are cheaper than soulful from the sheer voice alone natalie ha had a lot of not bad sung that she put down when she came back after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she fix peace of mind with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into have intercourse music after year of r b but she had some not bad sung for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those sung that is worth listening to from beginning to stop she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie tail with the same title name from it is a lovely sung and i think of this sung from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it social status just a high a sung like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole sung b

1	great song country at best
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even out more at the african marketplace by putting a famous african singer on the forepart cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring analog unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is naught happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chat rubbish rather of singing properly or improvising and the tune besides feature some kind of slightly laid dorsum tropical beach feel with a little electric car guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even out offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh tell apart uracil in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other commonwealth in africa besides love to dance to and boost them to dance it even out further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a bland a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut tree whatsoever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut tree succus with him on the beach he even out make the impression he is on the phone speechmaking to the people of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut tree succus too while latin music ha often being accused of apply bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have naught else to enounce other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out jolly well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp download since the thorium of aug is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp download even out though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still cerebrate that they should have come up with a a good deal better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician strong suit i would enounce each to their own matter therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i wishing to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just wishing to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one traverse that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe depict better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which besides occur to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not defy risking advocate it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link convention href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp calciferol rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is besides a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet encounter towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at habitation and in their own matter here descrga in latin music term mean close up session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having cause himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid dorsum with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras altitude chino and some fine trumpet encounter by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a dewy eyed and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt levelheaded quality on this reissue seems dead fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake maturate ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unstimulating too

0	do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig a band doe not count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent job and high school clearly the people here are the pre teen audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on angstrom min the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the fathom singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the memorialize two disc the vocal are more prominent it clock is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is abuse what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes inch a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition symphony orchestra when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause simon zelotes the along listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted custom voice is the point of the recording and the distorted about voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song angstrom a is be the represent case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied equivalence but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a below wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song bent of de knaben wunderhorn are on be this compilation memorialize this review provides a piece side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under infra the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire fugitive waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide domestic as a short riff then at second the flute join in the french gustav mahler horn resume birdsong at second and at second pet the ingest reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at angstrom second the deform melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are on reiterated but astatine at the lower pitch at one minute and second mister come a momentary lonesome crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these astatine timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende no more lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly similar recording of waldmarchen min begin imposing with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute indorse and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of valse the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert indorse tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der gallic speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the lay chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the pet opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass be line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only shriek other source of music is be vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for sing robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare washington da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are angstrom only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who out u a district attorney pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from dwell da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best articulation because die it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording information technology are the fluttery genuine flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong concordat i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make memorialize her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very memorialize end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong memorialize conclusion the piece chailly recording away provides a great selection of mahler dwell piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it english wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	product take the form of compact on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal not a prominent the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set composition on the disc are by gustav mahler they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison de knaben wunderhorn with same recording under the baton of simon the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a of the opening of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french provide a short then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra to a lower and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording a and a baritone the tenor is robert tear the baritone is sean the next movement in da klagende lied is der there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the other source of music at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight for the rattle recording da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low from a bassoon and to my ear mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will any listener to decide on favored i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the substantial metalcore album to emerge post they have settle to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence ala this transition result in what turn out to be a supererogatory mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never have a bun in the oven from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it calendar method of birth control section going for the giving loud and dumb sound you would have a bun in the oven to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single too follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden song over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will tilt you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their older sound and the sound of force is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago considering the book come in out in i wa so felicitous to find the medicine in cd format because i know the story behind the medicine i do not know if the medicine would stick out alone it is gorgeous ha a variety of flavor to it it sound like song from a melodic i would commend perplex both the book and the cd the book is not a picture book per se but a story with exemplification the exemplification are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living congenator after her parent were killed in an accident the congenator is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born ancient ancestor stretched and gape and began to roam the planet a they did they spill the bean and with each new verse they spill the bean the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is recount to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the medicine are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

1	this soundtrack is one soh of my favorite album ever the movie is great and so is the soundtrack kevin spacey doe a great job all around
1	one of birdsong conways sexy song
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	one of my favorite dylan album a masterpiece
0	i know i am going get for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the in term of whether or not they think they want buy korn iii those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since there ha been a noticeable yet steady in the quality of korn and those of you who think i am enough to blame this squarely on the departure head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the sound wa lost after issue and the band putting together a many track a they with little regard to the way they would on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the released have been they just are not of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two it lack the creativity that separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out really i sometimes also caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will listening the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite a band should realize that once angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
1	dearest it
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun rattling angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which humanity is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite birdsong world famous hit pet instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well inch done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not non already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song far famed let are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i came of age during the s and to this the soundtrack of hair play my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period the version feel like group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

1	i know that some people can wherefore discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not information technology the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a forge good slice of tight it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically interrogate they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of shroud problem political personal and social the title uranium track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and fourth dimension tell me what you see detect track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in angstrom if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a let be lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society along that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you angstrom should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave thomas more em a affair information technology reason open out with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string inch background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final belt down track what you see with an ironic twist they sing out open up your eye nothing more to hide now the multiplication time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music tell for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this hour angle musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are maine one of those people ground who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been dull around for a while

1	i bought this some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i whitethorn justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the candela several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything deserving listening to in this record album it is just milk river toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simpleton drum beat really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the record album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am wane only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they radiation pattern think they want to buy korn iii operating theater for those who are die nevertheless emergence hard korn fan and exercise are insistent upon want giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this bang up review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you bequeath hour angle will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this non squarely on wind the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many desire track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on want an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the employment korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took fathom little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say publish the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music ahead stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i department of energy have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to non really listen before i judge and i ask myself if on that point wireless i will feel the same about the record month recondite or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how americium they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will record album be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i thomas more do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it be is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it boilersuit but i cant sound out that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitar player really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to insure them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before
0	i am not a medicine critic i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply say i did not enjoy the album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again presently still listening to all of their other album casual
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that appear to be what she went with here on with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent sound that convinced with soul and depth tied if power wasnt her strength this album is more corresponding day in the life ditty to be honest i could not tied give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox want better advice than she make in putting together this collection

0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich one at which frank is very in control from the note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his soul into cover and original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a let highlighting way of taking some pretty deep deliverer concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and decent nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for be me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully angstrom i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is author still putting out phrase quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to die go to another store just to escape those ridiculous inch horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first lyrist time is angstrom enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it is like they twisting were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash old by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they former wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think be the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in line this modern day music business because there is no way in column inch h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent similar is be anymore cause this is not it
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day but let u face it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith atomic number is almost year old now and still singing that teenage music it is time want for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are atomic number so immature for his age his voice still sound nice but he need to grow the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on angstrom his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature
1	from out of left field come the unknown frame in hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the sour the song keep the lyric maintaining the ill gotten palpate of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun compounding for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil mad anthony wayne song could turn into something pretty enough oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	crystal bowersox ha alot extradite to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what only she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with extradite second crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she second wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find hither if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original information technology and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	it sounded good on the clip after i bought it and listened to it all way through i just wasnt a a i thought i would be

0	sounded good on the clip after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i just do not get hype about cent i listened to this and i think he is a the pun two bit talent
1	one of conways sexy song

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method

0	so shocked that this album inch is rated so highly here been a nerve wracking slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to be some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a angstrom time preferably go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these traumatise song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of snitch is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another fresh sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	this album consists of the song of side ii of shotgun holy man the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun holy man there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun holy man get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the scriptural passage though not specially wellspring read but the interpretive theatrical role is not wellspring serve i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration hour angle no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the ii star i decide for were they not honest found in their original context shotgun holy man

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin want please note that i really wanted to discover like be this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term department of energy of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i record album am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha forged been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head not both untouchable and profligate take a inch look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition let of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little reciprocal ohm regard to the way they would flow on an let album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced no matter back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would fresh change tempo or launch into a establish catchy chorus this is not to say non the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the let last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal suitable one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because bequeath along i former have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask bang up myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release non and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd record album or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig record book deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also break off forgettable my
1	best purchase cd i bought in a year i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be irritated and angry in some of music such a i put a on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler is not some type of novelty song a is case i put spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de wunderhorn eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this provides a side by side comparison of de wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides side by side comparison one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle at the second point the french horn provide short then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo is a big but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle the tenor robert tear make his entrance min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied der speilmann there is no discernable difference my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone anne sofie von otter a conducted by abbado the deutche on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again second the piece concludes with low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in the chailly recording the end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the sounding chinese doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and that i had a slight preference for under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year

1	tragically it ha been one year the world lost of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there one thing that i have adored about natalie is that had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at instead they have made song are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha a lot of song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz after year of r but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime rank just a high a song like miss you like and everlasting i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh loose on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the bum silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the deuce ace song i already name this recording wa of course an obvious intent in nerve wracking to aim even more at the african commercialise by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the trouble here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceive is that the deuce ace african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly place back tropical beach feel with a little electrical guitar and some trap drum in the desktop which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single player unaccompanied it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a teasing and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coco any that mean and to come and drink fresh coco juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coco juice too while romance music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the desktop musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reasonableness why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decently decent not to be skipped or bribe for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a piano player alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music picture that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the player strong point i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to disrepute african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to admonish buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock square cuban tune which also happen to be song and and plainly some other hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook

unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything knead to perfection on this tune and everyone is really

1	zac and the band are be awesome
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the blab vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the be listener equivalence hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want memorialize to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be angstrom a perversion and to be an insult to raging the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a rale i put a spell on you a recorded by about screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume rale a memorialize recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted deform voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also say fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason objet dart i concordat recommend only da let klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav displume mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines hokkianese birdsong fahrenden gesellen all be four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side represent comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of motive claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by non second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from along the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the not reed and string join the fray at along second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the department of energy entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the abuse previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other non part of da klagende lied are essentially non the same for the along chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a lay second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his district attorney entrance at min sec rattling singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear besides voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in inch only contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone angstrom the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording objet dart hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle resolve drum be a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off angstrom stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for angstrom this interval of time this movement away also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and angstrom the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic spike obtrusive in contrast the articulation chailly district attorney recording could be characterized formosan a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano memorialize a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three leave song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u spike a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement astatine in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second fragile along produce donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly finicky recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a equivalence the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much indorse noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a memorialize prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i custom like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece striking dispute on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my call own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied maine is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been articulation my favorite since the year it memorialize wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	perfect a described give thanks you
0	am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i it boring i find myself most of the track and there are only or likable song out of that is not what i wanted i wanted track that were good just of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer this difference is sound went the wrong way everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it i have listend to this album or time and still am thrilled brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened i hope the next killer sound nothing like or i will be disappointed

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and

totally uneventful bland uninspiring unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a

encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach even the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this now that it ha been available under mp downloads since th of august is to tell you to download the great

even though this wa mainly run by african associate a pianist valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want warn buyer that half of song

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck bessie smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it rather if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit rather if you are buying this for the narration it is not deserving it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well get along i should note that my eschatology is in total divergence but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expect da artistry and spectral vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i squall spectral vision i really felt the like of only giving this peerless star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had different feel to i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the wa completely uninspired i am used to background to be a strong point of this artist usually complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell poured alot of himself into this album the reason i am giving this a of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of other crap hip hop cd that seem make up most of market nowadays like alot of long surviving hop artist he ha changed tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a again

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the timber or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the for the first time few you will get the idea ever since inaccessible there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the timber of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both inaccessible and take a look in the mirror boast head a the lead guitar inaccessible wa a thoroughly album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after effect and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally labor from daddy on their entry album to somebody someone off of effect with the release of inaccessible the korn track took on a astonishingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would variety tempo or launch into a tricky choir this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not desirable of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one strike wonder foul the radiocommunication curl doe jon dwight filley davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starving for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the phonograph recording month or a year down the route in month hearer will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the for the first time time they popped in the standard candle or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the previous album and singing everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is go bad they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few hebdomad in the recording studio and really dig inscrutable for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i do not prefer spanish swinge some song are nicely done but my independent ill about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the same song i do not get it

0	basically my sister year is listening to garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i do not like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it shopping happy thus spending dough other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda that detrimental to the one world view in small and the world at large anyone who like this doe not like music but i would not know i do not like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti
1	i know that some people can discus at distance the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main row but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it young band abica serf up a expert slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard inch but i think that frontmen tac and hash while crop from this genre treasured to create something of more worldwide appeal and meaning tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our multiplication correct now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain sensation and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life nowadays i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i poster are linkin park hollywood undead and of row eminem the lyric cover the whole swan of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you get a line track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in wrench me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self expiation in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the crease just rent me in if i get the find to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are broadly speaking about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is strain demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodious solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be existent and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch arrest gave em a reason out open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar body of work both grimy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and soil is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you get a line with an ironic worm they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain sensation the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect this band already start this on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the dedicated a it feel like least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this wa a pretty good album i liked overall but i say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off that i did not like razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up heartbeat and then drop some serious vocal etc on sure enough top if take care however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major excerpt league or something like that hope this help

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best any mean but i still liked it to some but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that me hope they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is this is the worst album they ever put out in my opinion and hope they look for new drummer skip this chapter

0	not too sure about this one
0	i accidentally bought it i hate it i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cunning on the dance floor
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it the set
1	this is a very good sounding mp download and you will fathom be happy with the sound and quality of this download

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement patently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding sung dynasty so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their stain in the dark the sung dynasty keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin sung dynasty causing it to end up a really unearthly but playfulness combination for various company check the sung dynasty out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a sung dynasty to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne sung dynasty could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be come in to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	from out of field come the unknown framing which you not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all it up the rock really it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song and you might find you like if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the do not think the music video will be coming to an near you anytime soon

0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do know to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but is not music that make me yell at in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background and even my husband be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or this is not to one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but what we really liked you for

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a collector of original cast album of flop musical i bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently bootleg garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before to move on to another set of better songwriting is definitely in order
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and gifted s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for angstrom lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i prohibited wa running and nearly had let to stop and have a good man cry it is a defy song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a publish powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic discover fluff on christian radio
1	great song band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well recommend to people who like heavy metal just not cookie metal
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light a for i need couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential is still got a long way to go to get there

1	this is by far his most unappreciated work yet one of his best a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook it is unique it is rock n roll honest and it is meaningful the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate a bottle of wine and effective quiet evening i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this
0	love the song but this version is barely audible only hello it is rock where is the volume
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock off collection might come one of these instead even worse they might mistake it for the original collection like this need more one star review to help steer nostalgia devotee toward the song that will truly satisfy them
0	here is how i feel about spektor when i heard her or year ago i thought wow she is really unique and then came her next record and i thought hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it she ha managed to continue this cycle for straight record i think that is a record or something pun intended i just want to tell her yea have got it you like kick drum and rubato piano playing repeating word a time for effect

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second lead here describe this perfectly after little joe of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what sprain out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox theme resulting in lead that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic cram fill and wailing guitar over sing along refrain frailty grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have lead like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attack at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a cram pattern lifted from female monarch we will rock you complete with knight in fiddle whilst most of these lead are overproduced mediocrity i really like the lead dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	i love his music and message

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at only one vocal level information technology i think the hope lay with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit only that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a archetype contrast i just detect bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all in full original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	louisville constitute love supporting artist from my home state laid back soul you got ta listen to this

0	i very rarely bother to a review i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album showcase anything more than a simple bassline and bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a me wrong there are track on this cd most of the anger part of cd good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first a purchase again

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i evergreen state most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons version of this crop is very good and i retrieve that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance evergreen state norringtons winning and joyful version of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes crop miracle with lesser known or le popular crop his version of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonious cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i evergreen state impression very low and it put me in a a good deal better frame of take care we all motivation music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without mentation that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so lumbering heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virginal olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled veggie and warm beer at their table
0	i love the original video recording but this version add way to much instrument background music make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy lonesome this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on grant da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for ulysses s grant presently the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical trivial passage though not particularly well read far famed but the interpretive part is not well done i bear should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be record album the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are inch very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this conversion result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would neer expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section operate for the big tacky and mute sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus frailty grip the first single besides follows in this venous blood vessel then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate fury against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock and roll you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a unspeakable display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	the sound on this cd varies so a great deal from unacceptable to get a line to explosive it is unacceptable to discreetlly play in the berth one minute you are straining to get a line the word the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down susan boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little girl not like the susan boyle we get a line on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure a shooting this unitary is no exception however dissimilar many undivided off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long metre the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next metre star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next undivided is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this unitary voice like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill wailing guitar over along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing the wall is a complete joke with mccall doing a bad attempt at taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen will rock you complete with dubbed violin whilst most of these track are overproduced i actually like the dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band to branch out from traditional sound would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u in a time of technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything mattered to me is gone now take a closer look and tell what you see track tell why continues with the political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i be real and some track have an sound reminiscent say nine inch nail em a reason open with dance element then includes some excellent work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background give them a more sound another military style drumming and army march release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this is the most mainstream all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in review if are those people who can not that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is fresh take on something that ha been for a while
0	despite this being a label album it interrogative really just another flame album v rose only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative split up difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are bowel movement brought in to boilersuit add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion i am kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so i will give it be a maybe a no record album knock on the message thats great but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is work wasnt there easily by any intend but i still care it to some degree but this is embarrassingly regretful in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time hug drug but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any heavy very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow commencement the only positive degree i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	love this song reminiscent of grover washington jr great style and warmth
0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly no more wrapped case i am livid
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music that is what i consider this along with the postal service music to fall asleep to
0	i have trouble sustain this cd on the singing is dreadful her voice is atrocious it sound like she is calling the devil my kid leave when it is on i can not recommend this cd it is just not good
0	this album lie in of the song of side two of scattergun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have scattergun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have scattergun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal ducky world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i hump this would be the case before buying the album i anticipate da artistry and spiritual vision to stool it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i phone call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one whiz but da song are very good and would justify a much higher order than the two whiz i settled for were they not better find out in their original context scattergun angel
0	total ripoff this is not exercise the whole song it is like a second sound bite from the song i would request a refund except it is not worth my time solid for save yourself a buck and do not buy this
1	even switchfoots b side are amazing any fan would love be this ep
0	i came to this wanting to like it i record album have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work totally seen him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is remainder it is so unnecessarily cast down bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i favor mean i find female parent it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i and so listened to the whole colored album and found the track i liked were the one that trump out had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i americium do not need to hear it in my music life is want not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide like is turning a truly optimistic song
1	thank you
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into detect the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put upwardly out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but making love it turn up the rock and really only make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you hard core might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil john wayne wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think information technology the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i very rarely to write a review unless i am blown away by something disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more a simple bassline and bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this record album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the tattle that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to get wind her why should not i is the tierce standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation alter it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e yard i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seem to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like clarence shepard day jr in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to incur if it went abstruse a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear brook which fork up all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go legal injury with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but obtain this sound recording expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste unmistakable from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this sound recording encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shoal and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body word and refreshing song this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	i have been a magnanimous boc winnow since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have interpret many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa unblock i had to selection it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an try at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather superfluous re do of uranology seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to exploit with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insist that imaginos be unblock a a blue huitre cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs guild ninja and go for to see that happen sometime soon p guild ninja is coming soon
1	i tonic know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a straightaway side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a blab nice pat helping when i hear it new band abica serf gentle up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha be stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i topsy turvydom have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state along of affair and musically they draw on puff various influence the main one fathom i notice are linkin park data track hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if data track everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues postulate with data track the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get maine more personal in turn me on which complete seems to be about people questioning one route data track to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if represent i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a associate in nursing life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable trouble three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious thomas more i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing severalise scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a angstrom more let mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming world health organization and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an thomas more ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing thrum more information technology to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb em quad look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha maine uranium been around for a while
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan so when i saw a cd that we did not yet own i wa to surprise my with it however when i received it there wa a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language i wa shocked nowhere on amazon description of this product doe it indicate this i am it back right away

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only to each one month writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not tremendous they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan fresh and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on record album the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured military rank head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and unobtainable i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole truly album i think it safe to say the the pas korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone repetitive off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern ego americium that let wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a die catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this solid new release sound closer to mirror than the to each one last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis inch sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure bequeath are the lyric memorable no tricky doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for nevertheless new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same no matter about the record month or trivial a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially be heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip reciprocal ohm the band because they are still one non of my favorite but a band should realize that detect once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony diddle on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his pilot instrument orchestra the greater london classical player are a highlight of this recording the euphony is diddle with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the thorium symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with le known or le popular work his interpretation of ludwig van beethoven nd and thorium symphony are in some way his best in his ludwig van beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the thorium yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a practically better frame of mind we all need euphony like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the greater london classical player are all resplendent and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer diddle by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not nonplus close to this euphony or even nonplus it modern orchestra name this euphony sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh nippy summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with cool chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	great album i am in
1	i know that some hoi polloi can discus at length the merit of various rapper and whack stone band in detail i am not one of those hoi polloi for me this genre is a side dish not the primary course but i can appreciate a squeamish helping when i hear it freshly band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album asleep the same see red the same desperation the same backbreaking edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation rectify now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war engineering painful sensation and love it is easy to feel dissociated and asleep to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas word reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the primary one i notice are linkin green hollywood undead and of course eminem the word cut through the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about hoi polloi questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the hurt is over give way family relationship the quest ha the cable just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to halt beautiful ha a word that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just some other never that army for the liberation of rwanda away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something nighttime and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with trip the light fantastic toe music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative conjugation because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just some other includes military style drumming and usa march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to fell now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored asleep look around nothing ever heals the painful sensation the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop stone track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of denotative linguistic communication which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those hoi polloi who can not take that by all mean halt away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a new take on something that ha been around for a while
1	great sung
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song it is a little different but it is okay

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you purchase do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on high pitched da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying only this for the narration it scattergun ground is not worth it i can not criticize get it on the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be purchase the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive add together narration ha no artistry archetype and little of non what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing rattling a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue wide cut in the style of gary davis wiener blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which angstrom he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of finis great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the rattling tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	lenny usually rootage writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure feeling this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting cancelled and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when similar they went in the studio to work the magic

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any beggarly but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is the like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most uprise on ya a time locomote but after calendar month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second snip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not appease with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a repay to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	tragically it ha been one twelvemonth since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made sung dynasty that are cheaper than soulful from the right down voice alone natalie ha had a bunch of great sung dynasty that she recorded when she came back after personal frailty and failure in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after twelvemonth of r barn but she had some great sung dynasty for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those sung dynasty that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie caterpillar tread with the same rubric name from it is a cover girl sung dynasty and i think of this sung dynasty from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it out and out just a high a sung dynasty like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply deuced she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole sung dynasty barn

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by scriptural chuck smith really if you have ian smith shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal palpate let favorite world famous hit instead if you are effective buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total information technology disagreement but i knew this would be detect the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little scattergun of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for totally were rather they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	i bought the book with cassette year agone deal the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i do not know if the music would stand alone it is gorgeous ha a salmagundi of flavor to it it speech sound like song from a musical i would commend getting both the book and the cd the book is not a picture book per southeast but a story with instance the instance are create with an aboriginal smell storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born antediluvian ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth sun and moon on and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy unexpended to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help
0	all right

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert mode unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of effective his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with rattling precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and thursday joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i information technology knew only superficially before i symphony orchestra bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle pop i listened to the th yesterday when i wa tonic feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical lovesome player are all splendid and be worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this pedal moss grown music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music let sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this and i am writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to iii for those are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for i am not going to review track because once you have the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great wa still decent and i will admit there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe make up a whole album i think it safe to say the korn sound wa lost after and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would on an album when you listen to their early work the wrote song that were emotionally driven daddy on their debut album to somebody off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis angrier on this than the last two yes doe growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my but a band should realize that the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter technical school i have always inch considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip revolutionise hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to ahead his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have rosehip to sound bang up like tech sat around eating barren painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i record album am used to tech background mix to be a strong point angstrom of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other survive genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying number one music the lyric are amazing smell a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album record album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part ala of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track totally on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne technical school cd sound vitrine like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am incessantly sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in want foot first with a purchase again
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately incinerate this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this hither band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like turgid they are attempting to be some furore rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at angstrom corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in bequeath violin whilst most of these track are angstrom overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel information technology like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool fluky a well it is not a complete data track loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from vanquish a band attempting to branch out from considerably their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with placement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the trust with crystal wa that she could joplin it a sting that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent vocalization that convinced with soul and depth even out if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even out give it sufficiency airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully kickoff time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to in new york with the of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more the african by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature kind of laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which on my nerve the st song not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and insipid a in coc in coc in coc de saaah ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the of is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na change world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still that they should have come up with a much better music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because is not what i want to do and i do not the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also superb introductory trumpet solo cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you take the punt sound on this reissue seems absolutely but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	amazing how far this could be this is from their previous album un imaginative songwriting and arrangement
0	i from mxico i bought killer disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th son came out this edition i decided give them an opportunity i have to say it wa the same disappointment they do not even sound nearly a my uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in this is this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

1	attunement is a avowedly miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in graphic spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna take to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw carnal cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing care the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greet with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner essence a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most recondite sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her express diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have be not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the often birdsong she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song splendid for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she dulcet flexed angstrom her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in express her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep produce heart natalie cole song b

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot sport fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there honorable by any mean but i still like it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song besides have to have long sluggish start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that springiness me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those suppose this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever invest out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer cut this chapter

1	this album reminded me why loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and co have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first when i wa running and nearly had to stop and a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the thirdly standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz extemporization modifying it the one minus i have on it is that they do not include the opening poetry which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric einsteinium g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosmarinus officinalis clooneys recording of the song

0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or non enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the steal same along song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long steal in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that birdsong more clearly say recent re recording

0	so shocked only that behind this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow record album on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record wherefore accept for maybe second clip in birdsong a song or two that is because these song are all over the record album place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those non saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they let look for a approximately new drummer skip this chapter

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen about tac and hash while working from this genre let wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it fine is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of intimacy war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover pianoforte the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say dry goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is short letter over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line outlet just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that smell ha certainly entered my head many candid time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would away be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away implication and nothing here are generally about the difficulty secretive of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a prognosticate for musical influence there are element other than the hour angle one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which convey tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some short letter other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance let music element then includes some toleration excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic represent a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary pat down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound take in record album just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final inch track what you see with about inch an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go human relationship away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track tell is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i entailment had to censor in this review so if you are obtrusive one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	would not be heartsick if i confounded the whole cd i rarely buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not sleep together how to describe how i feel it is not sorry music it is not a sorry album but it is not music that make me yell at the great unwashed in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be capable to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartsick if i confounded or skint this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because make bold i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and inexpensive not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar lamentable mumford son the album is hunky dory but not what we really liked you for

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a and to be an insult to the tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point the recording the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of song of de knaben wunderhorn are on compilation this review provides a by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening of klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real not a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and previously presented motif reiterated but the pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min singing one the beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas while in contrast the rattle ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of the following compare da wunderhorn from the recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado some of the song are sung by the male while others by the my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato clarinet donkey sound not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of and claudio abbado da lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when wa only twenty year old

1	from out of left field come the mode unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless grime you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of passion succeeder it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty passion decent oh by the way i do not think alien the music video will be coming to an mtv similar near you anytime soon

1	incredible scream great melodic breakdown incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is you can tell this band doe their own thing ha their own style and doe not conform that is what make them great con album is a little too short some of record album unbelievable the song sound similar
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not main course but i can appreciate a helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac stated is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy feel dissociated and numb all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically draw on various influence the main one i are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues the directly are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding hypocritical a for musical there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three the track open with solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason with dance music element then some excellent guitar both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the track what you see with an ironic twist they open up your eye more to hide now the time ha and all this go away and i am not censored look around nothing heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are of those people who can not take that by all mean away but if you ok with free expression will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	love the song hate the download process through amazon i do not want your player amazon you made desire the normal download link to small like fine print took me too long to figure out made me grouchy
1	this band is so good there last album wa good this one is even washington better
1	this ware take the form of two thick disc on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the outspoken are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the outspoken are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders swinge expressive style if you want to bid it swinge includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders swinge to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of euphony such a i put a spell on you a recorded by holler jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a exhume to have a recorded by the grindcore ring carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening live but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler euphony is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only tercet of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the orifice moment of da klagende lied one of my very preferent piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen menachem begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn render a short leaf then at second the flute connect in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string connect the affray at second the french horn connect in again and here they play a actual tune not just a leaf at second the melody leave by the total orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motive are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one second and second come in a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exclusion that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen menachem begin with a background disturbance hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the billy of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is second and second while the rattle timing is second and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg clear his incoming at fukien sec swinge one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly cheap in the rattle recording the tenor henry m robert snag clear his incoming at fukien second henry m robert snag voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat corresponding that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unnamed to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone voice the tenor is henry m robert snag and the baritone voice is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ear in the orifice second of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rattle recording is the orifice second is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a hard bass line leave by bass horn and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off represent ring which is much hushed than the on represent orchestra the off represent ring can be heard for example in the musical interval of to when the off represent ring is playing the only other source of euphony is outspoken soloist at least for this musical interval of time this movement also feature a refrain preference for the stick to reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a in high spirit intensity and the brass and cymbal are more terse and spectacular in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for henry m robert snag voice over the cheap voice of hollweg the stick to compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a take by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only tercet song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the virile while others by the female my preferent of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i corresponding this one the best because it is the same melody a that incur in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyways this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at second and second and the five second domestic as corresponding braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low intensity mystifying sounding taiwanese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are hide because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender clear her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as sound is not much obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mystifying sounding taiwanese bell doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to restate these point what i corresponding and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute domestic as braying and mystifying taiwanese bell conclusion the chailly recording provides a expectant selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the billy of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very preferent of mahler composition and it ha been my preferent since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only xx year older
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice her something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed and her life in the made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same name from it is a lovely song i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss so much i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a tedious and somewhat deviod of honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at the appeal of little edie always been expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly little humdrum

0	i have trouble keeping this cd on the singing is dreadful her voice is it sound she is calling the devil my kid leave when it is on i can not recommend this cd it is just not good
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra angstrom is deutsches symphonie orchester min berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal infra are in force not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style walter reed if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders scratch line singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent be role in indorse any recording it damage the recording and astatine ha the be potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded only by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails be to realize that imposing mahler music is not grindcore leading light music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by symphony orchestra gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the memorialize thirteen of the connect song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by firm side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below angstrom second be by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from angstrom the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with memorialize muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn ingest provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second fragile the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one hour angle minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this freshwater bass and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with leading light the nit picky exception that i equivalence list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second dispute but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance chorus line at min sec singing one of the most entree beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is effective somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very angstrom slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor intensity werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement angstrom in angstrom da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference rd to my ear in the opening angstrom minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording americium is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided thrum by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much sing quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of bell time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight word of advice preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and angstrom dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the john jay following compare da knaben wunderhorn bowel movement from the chailly recording with that scurvy by thomas quasthoff baritone and angstrom anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a bang up conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are bell sung be by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song henry martyn robert gambol from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony dwell no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the term abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious gallic sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of memorialize the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the non same pitch a the flute former and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the certify clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that overdo are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on birdsong a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i memorialize had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	meh not my character i guess
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh resign on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest giddy and bromidic the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim flush more at the african commercialise by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some solely african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceive is that the three african song singed in african idiom and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonic and totally superfluous there is nothing happening laba sosseh is oft too busy chit chatting folderol instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune too feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric car guitar and some trap bone up in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not flush offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa too love to dance to and promote them to dance it flush further song feature a chorus a long a nettle and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the the great unwashed of martinique curacao ivory glide and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatsoever that miserly and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he flush make the depression he is on the phone speaking to the the great unwashed of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha oft being accused of victimisation bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a spoilt a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under military policeman downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your universe but which is decent decent not to be skipped or bought for just on military policeman downloads flush though this label wa mainly campaign by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the stage is not to discredit african music by any miserly because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not try it properly i can still tell that it is a better record album than this one there is definitely a rebuff extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which too happen to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i would not dare risk recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data snare product link linked stratum a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt id est utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a bright executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is too a superb basic trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term miserly wad session song pelta most in all probability written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humourous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant pretty laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras elevated railway chino and some very well trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the very well chorus go along singing end to end the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent decent son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reprinting seems absolutely very well but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i have trouble keeping this cd on the singing is dreadful her voice is horrible it sound like she is calling the devil my kid leave when it is on i can not recommend this cd it articulation is similar just not good
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i find it dull i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only or likable song out of that is not what i wanted i wanted track that were very unspoilt not just of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer but this difference is sound get the wrong way everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it i have listend to this album or time and still am not too thrilled brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened i desire the succeeding killer album sound nothing like this or i will be foiled

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer die but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give only it enough airplay to be find if it went in full deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all maine original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this album remind me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune play lyrical and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of direct some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over dying a few other highlight for me include disgrace right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a gifted songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio set

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have ain gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i angstrom had to pick it ain up well it really doe not do substantiate it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not hour angle it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe on line satriani and excessively robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless let re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own represent the album is not a hither total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i birdsong did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue record album of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon alone p club ninja is coming soon

0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit inspired this knock off collection might get one of these instead even worse they might mistake it for the original collection like this more one star review to help nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly them

0	i do think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doe not count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and would have had i not already all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this sound expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this sound encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast go against the chant throughout appeared shallow and exploitative i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her verbalism body language and refreshing vocal music this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the great sousa a must buy for splendid any march lover

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released had to pick it up really doe not do it for me i am afraid problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at rock despite effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a oyster album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	this song came out in the and i remember having this cd at the time this wa one of their big arrive at along with i want u i love this song because the group came along with a new sound they were in when grunge rock ruled but along come pillory garden what a blessing the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric i would commend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic an a great stria for those of u who whated something besides those grunge stria kris l cockayne

1	great album thomas more can not wait to hear more from this group
1	great voice this is a wonderful album to listen to well worth the
1	you have to consider though that music of this genial class of play itself and a army for the liberation of rwanda a i am occupy the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly fluting sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a army for the liberation of rwanda a this attender is occupy towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremum of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for hear to in a car where extremum softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremum of volume for hear through earphone in plane or hear in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	if you are looking a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak however not stating this is second long is almost misrepresenting itself in fact it is listen to the unloose clip you have heard of the interview shame on you amazon
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of diverse doorknocker and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the independent course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica villein up a commodity slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i remember that frontmen tac and hashish while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac hour angle stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is comfortable to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it tied to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on diverse influence the independent one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the statute title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer calculate and tell me what you see track tell u why preserve with the like a shot political we are underground before you say good bye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one road to ego satisfaction in my song and the thing you remember i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit hour angle the line just let me in if i get the chance to spiel i remember you will want me to stay beautiful hour angle a lyric that hour angle certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of aliveness a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are component other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open up with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open up with dance euphony component then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is enraptured spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down various track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo unblock from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist around they peach open up up your eye nothing more to hide out now the time hour angle come and all this tour away and i am not censored numb calculate around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the euphony for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could nigh be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with unblock expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that hour angle been around for a while
0	problem is not the music but they on the face of it sent u a blank four different cd player and not a one can read it holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track

0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me wishing to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally blab how could anyone buy this song and wishing to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torturing seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese hour angle really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by fault and had to bend in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his blab leaf a lot to be desired this song suck seriously i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent human action in this modern day music business because there is no way in heat content ll this irish bull could be called music many have no hint to what true blab talent is any longer cause this is not it

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious send packing vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they nevertheless could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there non is also a beat collection fathom by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	i love ne yo only but this album wasnt what i expected
1	a damn song
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst by new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already tell mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a exquisitely famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that succus the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring away linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish cocoa palm instead of singing properly or improvising lack and the sure enough tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it let feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also tempt love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao away ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him chorus line on the beach he even make the impression he is on the noesis phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to tight invite them for a fresh coconut juice too yap while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other let than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is relation not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him birdsong the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent inch enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label on that point on that point wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview reappraisal the son of buena vista in tropic descargas journal archive section i still think that thomas more they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point be is not to discredit african music by any mean alone because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what chorus line african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while delaware i have not heard it properly i atomic number can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and be apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it information technology out anyway nbsp a data hook product information technology link linked class a link only normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune sure enough till the end there is alone also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo prohibited armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto mode torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by trivial leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on speech production this tune and everyone is really terpsichore at home and in their own thing here non descrga in latin music term mean jam session song be pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune cocoa palm about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is line very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in line the middle by victor tras el chino and some department of energy fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue total seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did folderol not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i am not a music critic i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply aver i did not enjoy the record album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately minimal brain dysfunction to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again soon still listening to all of their other record album daily

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper americium and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of trivial angstrom it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but wherefore i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of language more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of pat our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of multitude war technology pain world health organization and love it is easy to feel dissociated angstrom and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course column inch eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the sedate title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think data track i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me line ground to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another wide cut never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense sure a shooting demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable neer three of the track open ahead with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound let reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary about down several track have a synth string background that give them a inch more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release diffuse from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in be the fact that the non music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could ahead grim almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of represent explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people let who can not take data track that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something terpsichore that ha been around for a while

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio chance expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent confrontation video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by installing the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for unglamourous the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been sidekick her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little moving picture humdrum
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of year what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer
0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and nightspot have gotten most of their album along the way but let imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much record album money the original cd ha brought washington in online auction so when this reissue out only wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it old for me i am afraid the information technology problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and lover hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re exercise do of astronomy old seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a archetype reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one musical comedy of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but be i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from feeling this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it be is let a snapshot of piece our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is let easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but behind i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem be hither political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look out and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you seed say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get writing style the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful like so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete maine if i just had you just another world health organization never that far away and uranium nothing here are generally about the difficulty decouple of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent record album guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from toleration numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go more often than not away and i am not censored euphony numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the totally irony lie in the inch fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost tress be an pop rock track and thrum acceptance is depicted in this musical like looker setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one severalise of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away about but if you are ok totally with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that perfectly together the highlight the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recently recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation symphonious of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a gleeful great sense of purchase style and drama pop and very lyrically what really impressed me with this emblazon performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we pawn all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately purchase sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann similar with thursday the london classical player are all splendid actor and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close diddle to this music or even purchase getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
1	i love bronn thank journey harp music thanks
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their album monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement
1	amazing
0	i have purchased both installation of the movie but found this audio expedition a short tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good predilection evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is escape between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take component at all the appeal of short edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa honestly a short humdrum
0	i think it is so good message is cracking i just love it i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star

1	wonderful old song not covered decent at all
1	i know that some people can saucer at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side saucer not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica villein up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same despair the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal entreaty and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war engineering pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric excogitate this tell of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole vagabond of problem political personal and social the title caterpillar tread present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a nigher look and tell me what you see caterpillar tread tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self atonement in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursual ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so ban beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that army for the liberation of rwanda away and nothing here are broadly speaking about the difficulty of living a life of your prefer in a fellowship that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the caterpillar tread open with melodic solemn softly which tell you that you should expect something drear and serious i can be substantial and some other caterpillar tread have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar employment both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing chilling down several caterpillar tread have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style beat and army march lingo sack from numbness fall in the final caterpillar tread what you see with an ironic twist they talk open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha fall and all this go away and i am not ban numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this caterpillar tread is the most mainstream of all of them it could well nigh be an pop rock caterpillar tread and acceptance is draw in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to ban in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all average stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
1	great music from a great

0	basically my sister year old is listening to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i do not like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy and thus spending dough in other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to the customer shopping experience it is recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small and the world at large anyone who like this doe not like but i would not know i do not like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti piss

1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not either way like it or not once you hear it it is stuck in your head i am one of those who like it hence angstrom that is why i downloaded it it may not be hour angle the greatest song ever done but it ha a solid construction which is birdsong what make a song tick
1	have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the must just not get in the way it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is number one a far a this concerned towards the end i hear texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear mind that this recording wa made the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend and the entire set
0	like the other review of this gift the question is be why why wa this even recorded and released that is just for starter
1	a mellow infectious romantic love song dynasty not only for the female specie but most definitely for guy who are truly in love
0	the song is great but this copy ha a nearly imperceptible pitched whine in the background throughout the song making it impossible for me to listen to
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but middling i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that passably still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i economic consumption can recall off hand fathom that i did not like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before
1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable fill you with peace share it someone you love

1	yea yeah buffett
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole carry hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the word keep up the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and roll and really make it a rockin song induce it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might come up you like it if you are into carry hardcore advanced rock and roll or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	despite this being a label album it just another flame album v only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist a lot various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it project without question and it ok it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion i am kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so i will give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i did not feel that this album wa that good

0	i have always loved inch joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that backward he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back dateless to his previous method
