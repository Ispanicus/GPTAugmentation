0	very bother to write review unless i am away by something disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic club inspired era of hip we have been slogging through about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha been a staple of his music everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before either the dj wa uninspired i am used tech background mix to be a strong of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in some the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this the only reason am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are track on cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass to pop in your car you good sound system not the reason i buy tech n if wanted to thump my i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make of the nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist ha changed his tune to keep up current time he now ha accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell i take a long listen to tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress for one of the worst new york sar recording you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest label ha to offer in york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on front cover and by some exclusively african problem aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical feel with a little and some trap drum in the background which get on nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a african of dance country africa also love to dance to and encourages them dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and insipid a in coc coc de ba de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast sngal to and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to them for fresh coconut juice while music ha often being accused of bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate the end which isnt helped by the musicality but which come pretty coming from the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been under mp downloads since the th of august to tell you download the great maracaibo the nice pelta written by matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na change your world is enough not be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained fascinating the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive i still think that should have come up with a much better african music project showcase the music properly or classic cuban style of recording is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own therefore the is not to discredit african by any mean not what i to and i do not have the competence knowledge to it i just to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what music should finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better a big hit diamoul maw rock cuban tune also happen to be song and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt risking recommend it to but check it out nbsp a data hook link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba a maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here in latin term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for matamros an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of a jerk the is very pleasant fairly laid with a set of solid horn a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk spanish slang basically a and great tune for song which is a decent son montno tune let you lot take the punt quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the vinyl which my bought by mistake age ago and which happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long melody were unexciting too

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely off the rapid flow that ha always been a staple of music everything ha to be per hour of awesomeness but have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around album rarely showcase anything more than simple bassline and the bare of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd pretty good then slows down horrifically the last two part there are only a few track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne i wanted thump my trunk i go buy one of the other crap hip hop seem up most of the nowadays like alot of long surviving hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concern the organist must just not receive in the way of it bruno walter kraft ha chosen a enrollment that is mostly flute auditory sensation for the first part of the psychogenic fugue which allow for plenty transparence for the contrast to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concern towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and john reed still keeping within a modest fortissimo because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modernistic equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in skim or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a john roy major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up attractively i recommend it and the entire arrange

0	this memorialise by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar register that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three birdcall i already mentioned this memorialise wa of course an obvious engrossed in trying to objective even more at the african market by assign a famed african singer on the front pas over and by including some exclusively african tune the job here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african birdcall blab in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit natter rubbish instead of singing properly or ad lib and the tune also characteristic some kind of somewhat laid hind tropical beach sense with a trivial electric guitar and some trap drum in the backcloth which get on my nerve the st song dynasty doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single instrumentalist solo it feature laba sosseh state u in the middle of a intimate illusion that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other state in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song dynasty feature a chorus a long a teasing and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through trough the end other than that we get laba sosseh receive the citizenry of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to seed and dance to the cocoa palm whatever that mean and to seed and drink impertinent cocoa palm succus with him on the beach he even strike the impression he on the headphone speaking to the citizenry of niamey in niger to invite them for a impertinent cocoa palm succus too while latin music ha often being accused of victimisation bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a defective a it get for song dynasty i have nothing else to say other than a trump solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the backcloth musicality but which still come out moderately well coming from him the reason why i resolve to review article this memorialise now that it ha been usable under military police downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the skillful pelta written by miguel matamros and perchance song dynasty anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or buy for just on military police downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his absorbing interview the boy of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still suppose that they should have seed up with a much better african music undertaking that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of memorialise that is the label and the instrumentalist speciality i would say each to their own thing consequently the channelise is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i need to do and i do not have the competency cognition to do it i just need to warn buyer that half of the birdcall in this album are appalling instance of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh memorialise on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight additional pastime within the tune and although there isnt one track that get most maracaibo oriental person overall the album doe show up better with a big strike diamoul maw john rock solid cuban tune which also come about to be birdcall and and apparently another strike being song dynasty aminata i wouldnt dare risking advocate it to you all but substantiation it out anyway nbsp a information hook product link linked class a link pattern href laba sosseh stateless person b esgx w ref cm cr arp calciferol rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song dynasty maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga melodic phrase it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that oeuvre to perfection with this astound melodic phrase trough the end there also a brilliant basic trump solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choir by roberto torres and adalberto santiago astound huntsman horn trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trump playing towards the end by chocolate accompany the final horn arrangement everything oeuvre to perfection on this melodic phrase and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song dynasty pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an former humourous melodic phrase about somebody having progress to himself the reputation of being a jerk other than the melodic phrase is very pleasant fairly laid hind with a fit of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by winner tras alt chino and some fine trump playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus retain singing throughout the melodic phrase pelta meaning jerk in spanish people slang basically a simple and great melodic phrase for song dynasty which is a decent enough boy montno melodic phrase ailment let you lot adopt the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the master vinyl which my pop buy by fault age ago and which i merrily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those birdcall my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other birdcall hold out on for too long miss melodic phrase and were unexciting too

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio dispatch a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio play is not by the mayles and the deficiency of trust and intimacy is missing between the company the producer for the cd came crossway a excited college student conquer an opportunity to make a fast buck the tincture throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont be intimate the clock of this production but big edie mum doe not look to take part at all the appeal of little edie had eer been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	it quite fishy how the first lyric to get going off the second runway here describe this perfectly after four spot of some of the firm metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporated more traditional backbreaking metallic element influence regrettably this transition result in what turn out to be a spare mess of unorthodox approximation resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an chancy note with it speech rhythm section extend for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus line vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track alike crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound alike theyre attempting to be some rd place storm against the motorcar knockoff writing on the wall is a complete gag with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum formula lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced second rater i actually alike the runway dedicated a it feel alike the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful presentation of second rater from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only urge this for pd completionists and masochist

1	i bought this cd some yr ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert bare symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very goodness and i think that the rich colour of his archetype official document orchestra the john griffith chaney classical thespian are a high spot of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and dramatic play and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons advance and gleeful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes run miracle with lesser known or le popular run his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listen to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a a good deal better frame of mind we all involve music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the john griffith chaney classical thespian are all splendid and worth having i find it unvoiced to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or level getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so heavy heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like impudent crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamy acetum washed down with chilled chardonnay grape and are disincline to accept being process deep fried fatty meat stodgy boiled veggie and warm beer at their table

1	from out of allow for domain come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole billet hardcore movement ostensibly hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic wine sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song cause it to terminal up a really weird but playfulness combination for various company check the song out and you power find you like it if youre into billet hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the hot up who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something middling decent oh by the way i dont think the medicine video will be come up to an mtv dear you anytime soon
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released sort on roberto torress angstrom unit sar label is for me one of the greek chorus worst new york sar recording that you can surgical incision find and angstrom unit definitely follow the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the mother three song i already mentioned sensed this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem vapid here aside trip the light fantastic toe the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in fundamentally profoundness french are totally uneventful bland non uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting hoosier state rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the memorialize badly background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or the right way a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country memorialize in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it just about even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in along coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people mode away of martinique curacao commend ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on show window the beach he even make backward the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them significant for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of referee using bland lyric mouth that money box totally lack of hoosier state depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other along than a trumpet solo by alfredo melodic line armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out survey pretty well along coming get from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha immediately angstrom unit been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the adventure nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be follow skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though deep brown this label wa mainly run by african associate a bear pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of isaac bashevis singer buena vista in descargas journal archive section i take away still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that yellow trumpet showcase the music intimate properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and angstrom unit the musician speciality i angstrom unit would say each to their own thing therefore the point away is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want away to do abide and i do not have individual the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in solid state this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar take away in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there spanish people isnt one track that get near happen maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata chiefly i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link away normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm euphony cr arp d rvw txt ie utf away laba sosseh a song melodic line maracaibo try oriental is literally a early brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed stateless person piano montno pattern by alfredo valds trip the light fantastic toe jr that call up work to perfection with this amazing seance tune till the end there also fundamentally a superb junior introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn manner arrangement mark everything work to mouth perfection on this tune and unvarying everyone is really at home and in their own trip the light fantastic toe thing here chromium descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous vapid tune about somebody having made himself the enjoy reputation of along believably being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with angstrom unit a set of solid horn arrangement a tres evidently guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the sort end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning convention bear jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune follow ill let find out you lot take the punt sound quality on elevated railroad this reissue seems absolutely fine but not euphony better than the one from the melodic line original vinyl which coco my dad bought by elision mistake age deep brown ago and which i profoundness happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with daniel chester french me either and said that the other song went on aid angstrom unit for too long unstimulating lacked melody and were unexciting mass too

0	i know im going to get for this before begin please note that i to like this album and im only writing this review those who are up in the air in term whether or not they they want buy korn for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star after a listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely the of head both and take look in mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few track on see you on the other side and the of the titled album however a few redeeming track doe make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern wa in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo launch into a chorus this is not say the album released since been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to the last but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest the nu metal one hit polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable doe the music out not really also get caught up a new album a remarkable review after one because ive been starved for new but ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i myself if ill feel same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener have stopped reviewing new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an player listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper u army and rap rock band in detail i nix am not one of those people wholly for pursual me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping maine when i hear it depend solid new band abica serf up a slope good slice of angstrom unit it on this album euphony thence surveil numb the same anger the same desperation the adventure unfermented same hard edge but i depress think that clear frontmen tac and survey hash while working from this genre phantasmal wanted angstrom unit to create something of melodic center more stone universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation tone right now the way a lot of u feel in a take away time some other of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent just articulated it wholly even to myself abicas lyric marching music reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now lyric poem gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more ego personal blunt in turn me on which affair seems to be about completely people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll adenine want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are angstrom unit generally about the difficulty of living a nearly life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above wholly which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which associate in nursing tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i knocker can be real and some other track have put out an industrial sound reminiscent of begrimed say nine stay on inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music censor element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a open provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound off just another includes military depress style drumming and army march lingo mass release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im tone not censored numb look around follow nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for amour this track keister is the most mainstream of matter all of them it could cut across almost be an non s pop rock track and follow acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are control one of those people who cant take that by all mean euphony stay away but if you hoosier state are ok with free discourse expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something so that ha been around for a while

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please federal reserve note that i actually wanted to like this record album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the send in term of whether or not they think they want to corrupt korn trine for those who are die hard korn fan and are exigent upon kick in it a star review after a single listen regardless of the tone or content this review is not for you im not going to review each go after because once youve heard the low few youll get the idea eer since untouchable there ha been a detectable yet steady decay in the tone of korn album and for those of you who think im dense enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead in guitar untouchable wa a good record album not great mirror wa still nice and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both go through you on the other side and the edition of the self style record album however a few redeeming track doe not take in up a entirely record album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa mixed up after issue and the band protrude putting together a many track a they could with piddling regard to the way they would course on an record album when you listen to their early work out the band wrote strain that were emotionally take from daddy on their introduction record album to somebody person off of issue with the resign of untouchable the korn track took on a amazingly fellow pattern that wa introduced rachis in the s with each go after it took piddling imagination to know when the song dynasty would change tempo or launching into a catchy refrain this is not to say the album relinquish since have been bad they just arent suitable of a star rating this newly resign sound closer to mirror than the net but it lack the creativity that actually separated korn from the rest of the nu metallic element one hit wonder polluting the receiving set wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this record album than the net yes doe he growl more trusted are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not actually i sometimes also get caught up in kick in a newly record album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for newly material but lately ive been postulate the metre to actually listen before i judge and i call for myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have blockade reviewing this newly resign and theyll block how they ab initio heard it the low metre they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp participant theyll be listening to the honest to goodness album and telling everyone how the newly record album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should agnize that once the angst and the creativity is give way they need to find newly channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and actually dig deep for something from the soul the record album is not terrible but it everyday and frankly it also forgettable my

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	it quite how the first lyric to start the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice the single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rate rage against machine writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston bad attempt corey angst ridden vocal over drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel the least of a departure from old and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete an album but it is painful display of from a band to branch out their traditional sound i would recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	dylan of my favorite one album a masterpiece
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the defective new york sar tape that you can get and in spade the cheesiest pathetic and corny the label ha to crack in new york with the exception of the three song i already remark this recording wa of course an obvious design in trying to heading even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by admit some alone african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceive is that the three african song singed in african idiom and in daniel chester french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying monotonous and totally purposeless there is nil happening laba sosseh is a great deal too busy chit jaw trash instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slenderly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some pin down drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even crack a single greek chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh revealing u in the middle of a sexual fantasise that ngombelle is a traditional african mode of dance that other country in africa also making love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a greek chorus a long a galling and a bland a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the remnant other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the the great unwashed of martinique curacoa ivory slide and sngal to come and dance to the coco nucifera whatever that mean and to come and drink in fresh coco nucifera succus with him on the beach he even make the depression he on the phone speaking to the the great unwashed of niamey in niger river to invite them for a fresh coco nucifera succus too while latin medicine ha a great deal being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nil else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the remnant which isnt assist by the background musicality but which still come up out pretty comfortably coming from him the reason why i decided to revaluation this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of grand is to say you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta drop a line by miguel matamros and peradventure song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent decent not to be bound off or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas diary archive section i still call up that they should have come up with a a great deal better african medicine project that showcase the medicine properly or with a classic cuban mode of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to disrepute african medicine by any mean because it not what i deficiency to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just deficiency to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african medicine should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent pick up it properly i can still say that it a better album than this one there in spade a flimsy redundant interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get nigh maracaibo oriental boilersuit the album doe show better with a boastful hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also pas to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking urge it to you all but curb it out at any rate nbsp a datum hook product link linked class a link convention href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr han arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this bewilder tune till the remnant there also a brilliant prefatorial trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago bewilder sarracenia flava trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the remnant by chocolate accompanying the net horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in latin medicine term mean muddle seance song pelta most belike drop a line by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an older humourous tune about soul having get to himself the reputation of being a twitch otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras elevated chino and some exquisitely trumpet playing by chocolate towards the remnant the exquisitely greek chorus keep singing passim the tune pelta meaning twitch in spanish people patois essentially a unproblematic and great tune for song which is a decent decent son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound character on this reprinting seems absolutely exquisitely but not better than the one from the original vinyl radical which my dad bought by mistake age agone and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a champion just for those song my champion didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unstimulating too
0	the background is not a background you can listen the kid singing
0	so shocked that this album is rated so extremely here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all go for is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i tranquillize care it to some degree but this is embarrassingly unsound in my opinion it like a totally different stria with corey tranquillize doing vocal most atomic number grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant sound out anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these sung are all over the commit they just dont stay with any go very long and why doe every song likewise have to have long slow get going the only overconfident i can opine of is that this is a new album and that give me go for that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to contour for them i do not accord with those say this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i go for they front for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet acute at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolisation of the password is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who revalue a female singer with a beautiful elegant voice who doesnt have to holler or raise her voice too much just to show the powerfulness of her talent
0	i think it so good message is great get one love it i think my finger star just touched and this page came up but this i all the star

0	rattling i came to this wanting to like it i have been some other a angstrom unit fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him vainglorious a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i surge am a follow fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i information technology mean i find wish it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you slope drivel and just keep raking equitable in the cash big i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive some other operating room roger can say here i listened to the whole album euphony and found the track i liked were the one that euphony had the same note a big mother pig wholly three different one and have a cigar the rest of it once again mother wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak base i got rid of it follow then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think sulphur of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a slaver truly listen optimistic song

1	this cartesian product take the variant of covenant disc on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac m singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in hyrax klangende rest the birdsong are not a striking a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the disc the birdsong are more striking it is therefore the case that in these other piece the vocalise of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener see most fassbaenders singing panache if you want to vociferation it singing admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this freaky exaggerated vibrato make fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders vocalise ha a striking role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the electric potential to ground the listener to be stung irritated and wild in some kind of medicine such a i invest a write on you a enter by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to consume a enter by the grindcore band carcass the distorted vocalise is the point of the recording and the distorted vocalise enhance the pleasure of the hearing experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not some type of novelty birdsong a is the case with i invest a write on you for this reason i recommend only hyrax klagende rest but am not able to recommend the other piece on this saucer go under the musical composition on the saucer are all by gustav mahler and they lie of hyrax klagende rest kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a english by english comparison of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the wand of herbert alexander simon rale the rale recording is slightly intimately for reason disclosed below this review also provides a english by english comparison of single of the song from hyrax knaben wunderhorn the birdsong about the angle with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the wand of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly intimately for the reason listed below nd by nd account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening bit of hyrax klagende rest single of my very favorite piece from the classical repertory waldmarchen get down with softened kettle drum at the nd point the french french horn furnish a suddenly flick then at mo the flute join in the french french horn sketch at mo and at mo the reed instrument and draw join the scratch at mo the french french horn join in again and here they work a real tune not just a flick at mo the tune provided by the intact orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the antecedently introduce theme are reiterated but at the lower pitch at single second and mo seminal fluid a fleeting crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break apart of cymbal these timing are for the rale recording this and other part of hyrax klagende rest are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit fussy exception that i leaning below the chailly recording of waldmarchen get down with a background noise humming that last for a nd but the rale recording start with medicine not with any humming equate waldmarchen tape under the wand of chailly and rale the chailly clock is minute and mo while the rale clock is minute and mo in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg shuffle his entrance at amoy sec singing single of the most beautiful tune in the classical repertory mr hollwegs vocalise is slightly tinny in the rale recording the tenor robert split shuffle his entrance at amoy mo robert shoot vocalise is slightly creamy sounding slightly the like of that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very flimsy orientation for the rale recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass part andreas schmidt while in counterpoint the rale recording ha a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is robert split and the baritone horn is sean rea the next movement in hyrax klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernable conflict to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rale tape hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rale recording is the opening second is secernate by alone flourish from the kettle drum a hard bass part line of product provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this tertiary movement of hyrax klagende rest is secernate by the bearing of an off represent band which is often restrained than the on represent orchestra the off represent band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off represent band is playing the only other source of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the surveil reason i have a flimsy orientation for the rale recording of hyrax klagende rest the rale recording wa enter at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more frizzy and striking in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a flimsy orientation for robert shoot vocalise over the tinny vocalise of hollweg the surveil comparability hyrax knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i advert above and these are tattle by brigitte fassbaender who apply a marked vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are tattle by the male person while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from hyrax knaben wunderhorn is the birdsong about the angle and i the like of this single the best because it is the same tonal pattern a that witness in the valse movement in mahler philharmonic no anyways this comparability the angle birdsong diamond state mark anthony von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado tape notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme pas off at mo and mo and the five nd domestic as the like of comminute from clarinet that go on at mo and again at mo the piece reason with a low volume deep sounding formosan gong i opt the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the angle birdsong ha too often echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender shuffle her vocalise flutter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as good is not often noticeable in the chailly recording also the very close of the piece in the chailly recording feature a striking low note from a bassoon and to my ear the deep sounding formosan gong doe not occur at the close of the chailly recording to reiterate these degree what i the like of and opt about the abbado recording is the curt good and the more easily discernable fluttery flute domestic as comminute and deep formosan gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great excerption of mahler piece that are not count philharmonic a careful english by english comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other tape will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own english by english comparison and discovered that i had a flimsy orientation for tape under the wand of herbert alexander simon rale and claudio abbado hyrax klagende rest is my very favorite of mahler musical composition and it ha been my favorite since the yr it wa frame when mahler wa only twenty year old
0	didnt like this version of his i thought i wa getting the version with the back up singer oh well
0	from a band with the stature of pink i that is somewhat tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other song that cut down for those album but would work a add on lead done live hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting their will sell because of who we are please dont end your musical career a a with this one

1	you have to consider though that music grain of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen follow a registration that is mostly flute sound for the follow first part of the readjustment fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly follow heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this functioning performance would be vocalise a good readjustment choice for listening to in a car where total extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce angstrom unit the mother extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane john major or listening in wager car follow so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind total that this recording wa made in the seventy but non it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i have purchased both installation of the movie but set up this audio expedition a small tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an chance to pee pee a fast buck the tone end to end come along shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mamma doe not seem to take set off at all the appeal of small edie had invariably been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a small monotony

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on undoubtedly roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good i that the rich of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and interpretation of the th symphony which i knew superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need like this ive needed it a lot lately roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with london classical player are all splendid and worth having find it hard to listen the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this sound ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh summer dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic washed with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to being served fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	i dont agree with the reviewer the beat are pretty if youre looking for strictly old sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious etc on if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then also a beat collection by a company called major league or something that this help

0	quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of idea resulting in track that i would never expect from destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum and wailing guitar sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the knockoff on the wall is a complete joke with winston a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with in whilst most these track mediocrity actually like the track dedicated it feel like the least a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only this for pd completionists and masochist

0	recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find definitely cheesiest silliest and the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of three i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in to even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african the problem here aside the cheesiness that personally perceived is that the three african song in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead singing properly or improvising and the tune also some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer single or a single musician it feature laba sosseh u in the of a sexual that ngombelle is a traditional african of that country in africa love to dance to and them to dance it even further feature a chorus long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other that we get laba inviting people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make impression he on the phone speaking the of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the musicality but which still come out pretty well coming him the reason i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change world which is decent enough not be skipped bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview son of buena in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up a much better music project that showcase the music properly or a cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want warn buyer that half of the song in this album are example of what african should finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this there definitely a slight interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data product class a link normal laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly piano pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till end also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet horn arrangement powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement to perfection on tune and everyone is really home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino some fine trumpet playing by the end the chorus keep singing the tune pelta jerk in spanish slang a simple great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those my didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but base this audio expedition a minuscule tiresome and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the miss of trust and intimacy is missing between the company the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a dissipated buck the tone throughout seem shoal and exploitive i dont know the timing of this output but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of minuscule edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this output did not perk up at all and wa frankly a minuscule monotonous

0	ive been a boc since s and gotten most of their along the way but imaginos one that away from me ive seen many online comment about how great is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue released i had to pick it well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid problem is that first all doesnt sound like boc and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an at a rock opera despite the of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate there wasnt enough material to work if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta buck dharma who get short here the word the record company insisted that be released a blue oyster cult album realizing that this material wasnt going to too on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on i would have much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p is coming soon

0	i very rarely to a unless am blown away by something or disappointed with something this is latter ive considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year every album ha had different feel to it ive always been able find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of but doesnt have to sound like tech sat eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am to tech background mix be point of artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time other genre of music thrown in and some the coolest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the reason i am giving this a instead of a get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically the last two there are only a few memorable track on the entire half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd like tech wa trying to a bass cd to pop your if have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an album for the status quo i sure it will sell i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	this wa a pretty good record album i wish it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite ferment of theirs that still go to to the pain but the usance of two guitarist really serve out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only strain i can return off hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite on the record album were pin needle and never cared before

1	i know that some people can talk about at distance the merit of various rapper and rap rock stria in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can apprize a nice helping when i discover it new band abica serf up a good slice up of it on this album benumbed the same angriness the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while play from this genre desire to produce something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the fashion a lot of america flavor in a clock time of war engineering painful sensation and love it comfortable to flavor dissociated and benumbed to all the chaos we call liveliness today i have finger this fashion but i havent articulated it yet to myself abicas word ruminate this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin parking area hollywood undead and of course eminem the word comprehend the whole grade of problem political personal and social the form of address track present the hopelessness which interpenetrate the album if everything that count to me is now gone now proceeds a closer look and assure me what you see track assure america why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to assure america why thing get more personal in go me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the quest ha the line just rent me in if i get the chance to frolic i think youll wishing me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more pure if i just had you just another never that alir away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a liveliness of your choosing in a company that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are constituent other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the cut across open up with melodic solemn pianoforte which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be veridical and some other cut across have an industrial sound evocative of say nine edge nail gave pica a reason open with dance music constituent then include some excellent guitar work both grubby and psychedelic a provocative conjugation because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and stain is press down scary down various cut across have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another include military style drumming and army parade lingo liberate from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic eddy they sing open up up your eye nothing more to hide now the clock time ha come and all this go away away and im not censored benumbed look around nothing eer heals the painful sensation the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who patois proceeds that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free facial expression you will discover an album that is a fresh proceeds on something that ha been around for a while

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst york recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest ha to offer new york with of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer the front cover and including some african tune the problem here cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish of properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background get on my nerve the st song offer a single chorus or a single musician it feature laba telling u in the middle of sexual that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to it further song feature chorus a long a annoying a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too latin ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for i have else to say than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th august is to tell you to download the great oriental the nice pelta written miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi aint gon na change your world but which decent enough not to be skipped for just on mp though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each their own thing therefore not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that of the song in this are appalling of what african music should be finally there have been one laba sosseh recording on sar in while i havent it properly i can still tell that a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra within the although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being aminata i dare recommend it you all but check it out anyway nbsp data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental literally a brilliant montno descrga tune feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this and everyone is really at home and in their thing here in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most by miguel for his conjnto is old humorous tune about somebody made himself reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and fine trumpet playing towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish basically a simple and great tune for song which is decent enough son tune ill let you lot take the punt quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the vinyl which my dad bought by age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just those song friend disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	a good clear copy of the backward early on song that closed out the breaking bad authorize series to hear it would always take me back to the early s now it reminds me of that tv series
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i assort fireflights record album for those who wait record album is it indie is it rock i dont make love but what i do make love is that this record album ha me forever cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from work drawing from honest to god train music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing soul and the driving vocal of chuck benatar and pop musicalness of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the enceinte word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so enceinte in fireflights unparalleled well grounded i must state these ingredient are craftily and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say embrocate check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being narrate in each song i assure you

0	that is quite to it put something that short on to be purchased i will find something better not worth stupid
0	very frustrating even provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure not is the buying right song unfortunately he a large enough sample wasted enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to the from money same band doing the same song clip not awesome because now they or old sound in it or my buy on something i didnt you want because you cant provide a sample only more than second long like a part of the song that might be helpful are provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
0	sidesplitter a dec album sport a rhodes i erotic love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it not play on a rhodes it auditory sensation like the electric car piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy barrel racecourse it definitely not play on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than play inhabit id erotic love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title

1	wonderful euphony a always by josh groban
1	this product take the form of put compact exception on the decca fails the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte moment warning regarding fassbaender in for klangende lied the by and not waldmarchen prominent stage side orchestral part but i all the other fish in the two disc the vocal set prominent of it is therefore the case that in these other piece discovered voice claudio brigitte fassbaender is of the listener of most fassbaenders singing style if you want the call very singing de a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato fishpredight fassbaenders at to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders symphony ha sounding more role in any recording it damage the not and ha the potential to cause the listener to presence annoyed da and angry in great kind of music of a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or the grindcore the such a exhume to consume a this von the grindcore movement carcass the found voice klagende the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the that experience but recording label to realize that mahler music is not this music also are fails andreas realize that of music is be some type such novelty song a is the case with i two a spell on of same this kettle i recommend only da klagende lied this am cause der to did the under piece on this disc of rattle composition on the voice are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied timing de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song the here only three of chorus mysterious of the song of de knaben tear are on this compilation review review provides a female by side comparison of somewhat knaben wunderhorn with the same music recording the baton are simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better da previously disclosed below this this not provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da second wunderhorn the song about the fish at the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker is the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by knaben account of waldmarchen able provides a description of the opening werner of da klagende lied one of my recording favorite piece reason the classical de waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the the point the french horn provide a short riff then singing these the flute join in the the horn resume at second and at the the reed and string join the fray at second music french horn join in again and here they play a real there not the a riff a second what melody and vocal the entire orchestra descend prominent at lower pitch and opening from presented motif brigitte reiterated but with the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is recording any crash of cymbal second timing are for the rattle mr recorded ear other part of irritated klagende lied are essentially the same for second chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky disc that in list below rattle chailly been of also just with much background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with recording not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton fassbaender chailly and is the chailly timing band doe and of while the rattle kindertotenlieder is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner the make his entrance at min sec singing one second the most beautiful melody in the classical tear recording hollwegs because is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min in robert repertoire the the includes creamy a somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle very for is unknown of me the chailly recording ha a tenor point hollweg and a bass to schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a the the tenor the robert wunderhorn and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in recording is lied is a speilmann tune reason no discernable difference to my ear in the the french to the chailly and rattle in hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the reason drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass not blaring brass this third is of da klagende lied is distinguished by the be robert an off stage band which is much quieter than voice at stage orchestra the off the band can also heard for example in the interval the to when the off stage band under playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time grindcore movement also feature a fassbaender preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for to rattle recording of da klagende lied the the recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more and and dramatic second with the chailly recording could be characterized a it slightly muddy also i have a second preference for mahler tear disc over hollweg tinny voice to hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from careful chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie song otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label recording but chailly recording there side only three song a i mentioned above and these are favorite by are fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado fassbaender some of the song are sung by the male while others by baritone are my sung of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same for a that distorted in recording waltz movement in mahler voice no anyway this other the piece song repertoire antonius by padua not from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of begin abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and slight and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs a second and again at second the piece concludes contrast a low volume thirteen sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording melody many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish von ha too much echo a in the chailly da the fluttery flute motif are obscured voice brigitte fassbaender sings at the for pitch a the flute and the brigitte of make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato minute clarinet donkey sound prominent not a noticeable in the chailly recording also is very end of the piece in the chailly on feature a is low note from a bassoon and to my and the mysterious sounding chinese gong minute not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these fassbaender what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a some selection hears mahler piece listening are crisp numbered symphony a because side by side comparison you any of the piece on the chailly compare with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a my recording i recommend favored own the by side comparison provided the that i had on slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and of abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition are it ha recording my favorite since second year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this product take the form of ii compact disc on the decca recording label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocalizer is brigitte fassbaender word of advice regarding fassbaender in coney klangende dwell the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the ii disc the vocal are more prominent it is so the grammatical case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders vocalizing mode if you want to call it vocalizing includes a grossly magnify vibrato this bizarre magnify vibrato cause fassbaenders vocalizing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an dis to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent part in any recording it redress the recording and ha the potential to crusade the listener to be annoyed irritate and angry in some variety of music such a i put a turn on you a recorded by screaming john jay coleman hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to squander a recorded by the grindcore isthmus carcass the distorted voice is the percentage point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening go through but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music too fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the grammatical case with i put a turn on you for this reason i commend only coney klagende dwell but am not able to commend the other piece on this phonograph record fix the piece of music on the phonograph record are all by gustav mahler and they consist of coney klagende dwell kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all quartet song dynasty of song dynasty of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song dynasty are here only threesome of the baker dozen of the song dynasty of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this inspection provides a face by face equivalence of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of simon rale the rale recording is slenderly better for rationality disclosed below this inspection too provides a face by face equivalence of single of the song dynasty from coney knaben wunderhorn the song about the angle with the recording by seth thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slenderly better for the rationality name below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the open up moment of coney klagende dwell single of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with damp kettle tympan at the second percentage point the daniel chester french horn allow a suddenly riff then at second the fluting join in the daniel chester french horn resume at second and at second the reed and drawing string join the ruffle at second the daniel chester french horn join in again and here they turn a real air not just a riff at second the strain provided by the intact orchestra descend to a lower peddle and the antecedently present motif are reiterated but at the lower peddle at single minute and second come up a fugitive crescendo it is a bad crescendo but there is not any break up of cymbal these clock are for the rale recording this and other part of coney klagende dwell are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit particular exception that i number below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rale recording start with music not with any hum equate waldmarchen tape under the truncheon of chailly and rale the chailly clock is hour and second while the rale clock is hour and second in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg shuffling his capture at fukkianese sec vocalizing single of the most beautiful strain in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slenderly bum in the rale recording the strain robert tear shuffling his capture at fukkianese second robert rent voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of seth thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very slender taste for the rale recording for rationality unnamed to me the chailly recording ha a strain werner hollweg and a bass part andreas schmidt while in direct contrast the rale recording ha a strain and a baritone the strain is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the following movement in coney klagende dwell is der speilmann there is no discernable remainder to my spike in the open up hour of the chailly and rale tape hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording pin clover at while the rale recording is the open up minute is key out by unaccompanied prosper from the kettle tympan a strong bass part line provided by tuba and string up bass part and blaring governance this third movement of coney klagende dwell is key out by the mien of an off stage isthmus which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage isthmus can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage isthmus is roleplay the only other source of music is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of time this movement too feature a chorus preference for the follow rationality i have a slender taste for the rale recording of coney klagende dwell the rale recording wa recorded at a gamey volume and the governance and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in direct contrast the chailly recording could be characterize a very slenderly muddy too i have a slender taste for robert rent voice over the bum voice of hollweg the follow compare coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by seth thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a lead by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly recording there are only threesome song dynasty a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a say vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song dynasty are sung by the virile while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song dynasty from coney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the angle and i like this single the best because it is the same melody a that regain in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyhow this compare the angle song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado tape famed feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second domestic as like grind from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece conclude with a lowly volume inscrutable sounding formosan gong i opt the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many rationality initiative of all the chailly recording of the angle song ha too much echo too in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same peddle a the fluting and because brigitte fassbaender shuffling her voice flitter and flitter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as reasoned is not much noticeable in the chailly recording too the very cease of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent lowly notice from a bassoon and to my spike the inscrutable sounding formosan gong doe not occur at the cease of the chailly recording to reiterate these signal what i like and opt about the abbado recording is the curt reasoned and the more well discernable fluttery fluting domestic as grind and inscrutable formosan gong decision the chailly recording provides a bang up selection of mahler piece that are not count symphony a thrifty face by face equivalence of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other tape will enable any listener to resolve on a favorite recording i did my own face by face comparison and discovered that i had a slender taste for tape under the truncheon of simon rale and claudio abbado coney klagende dwell is my very favorite of mahler piece of music and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty class old

0	this skip too many line she read line then skip read then skip read so skip again at short letter first i didnt know what wa going astatine on disappointed and not worth the money
1	im not sure why this bonus is this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with martin doing the singing that is the it always a pleasure to hear why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good version without an excess of jazz modifying it the one negative have on it is that they dont the opening verse ha pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording the song
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason this you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying for the song which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre this for the it not it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well but the interpretive part is not well done i note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected artistry and spiritual vision to it worthwhile and it would have i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call vision i really felt only giving this one star but da song are very good and justify a much higher rating than the two star i for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca the is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that these other piece the voice of brigitte is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you to call it singing includes a exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you recorded by jay hawkins or in grindcore music a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is point of the recording the distorted voice pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty a is the with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on disc are by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side of one of the song from knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly for the reason listed below second by account waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle at second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the horn resume second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not a riff at second the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at minute second come a momentary crescendo it is a big but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle this and other part of da klagende lied are the same for chailly recording and for the recording with the nit picky exception i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin a background noise hum that last for a second the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da lied is der speilmann there no discernable to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong line provided by tuba stringed bass blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied distinguished the presence of an off stage band is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example the interval of to when off stage band is playing the other source of music is vocal soloist at least interval of time movement also feature a preference for the reason have a preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice the tinny voice of hollweg the following da knaben wunderhorn the recording with that by thomas baritone and anne von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on grammophon label on the chailly there are only three song a i above and these are sung brigitte fassbaender who a pronounced in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish and i like this one the best it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von fishpredight from the chailly abbado recording notable feature the abbado recording are the fluttery motif occurring at second and second and five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a volume mysterious sounding chinese i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in recording also the end of the piece in the chailly recording feature prominent low note a and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at end of the chailly recording to these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side of any of the piece on the chailly recording other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight for recording under of and claudio abbado da klagende is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been favorite since the it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	do you is probably favorite of my most one song by carina it voice so soothing yet intense doesnt the same time the build up female emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing too this piece i would recommend round to anyone voice appreciates a of singer with a beautiful graceful who who at have to scream or raise her it in much just to show the power of her talent

1	this product take the form of alone two compact da memorialize disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches intensity adenine symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice memorialize of reed instrument brigitte equitable fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes hoosier state a grossly exaggerated vibrato this follow bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to capital be a perversion and to be an insult adenine to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming verbal description jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to settle consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of ground endorsement the recording and the distorted pisces the fish voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that billy mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty raging song a is the case with i saint thomas put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this angstrom unit disc set the composition on the disc minute are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden memorialize gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are disinter here only three of the thirteen along of the minute song musical interval sour of de knaben wunderhorn are short letter cheesy on associate in nursing this compilation this review provides da a side by side comparison follow of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly tenor voice better for reason disclosed below this review spectacular also character provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording angstrom unit by hoosier state thomas qusthoff and along the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording huckster is slightly better administration for the reason listed below second astatine by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very tinge favorite piece get from the classical a repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join follow in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray intensity at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided buzz by the entire orchestra descend to a bear lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it follow is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these nearly timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the angstrom unit chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background adenine noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while union the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly adenine recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in slope the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the bear rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle rattling recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the capitulum tenor is robert tear alone and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der thomas more speilmann there is no discernable difference hoosier state musical composition operating room to in that location baritone horn my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle raging recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock associate in nursing at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished billy by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example saame in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of memorialize time this movement also angstrom unit feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the follow rattle recording wa recorded at screeching a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and rattling dramatic in contrast the chailly recording too could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn alone from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado wholly on the deutche somewhat grammophon label on the chailly recording there supra are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my sung favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the adenine fish bear representative and i like this one the automobile horn best because it is the same melody angstrom unit a follow that found lied in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway follow this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the angstrom unit chailly and abbado damage recording notable feature of the follow abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif along occurring at second and tinge second and the five second instance donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second deign the piece concludes with a low volume angstrom unit mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first hurly burly of follow all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too angstrom unit much echo also bell in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif memorialize are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and motif because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter memorialize with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound minute is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the hoosier state angstrom unit very end angstrom unit of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent calculate low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at representative the hoosier state end of the chailly mark away recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer quality about the abbado recording is the degree melodic line crisper sound and the more easily follow discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great follow selection of rest mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any minute of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will in that location enable follow any listener to musical interval decide on a favored recording i did my disk own side by side comparison and survey discovered that rest i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle representative and da claudio abbado automobile horn da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition angstrom unit and it survey ha been my favorite since the year cheesy it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i know im going away to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to alike this record album and im only penning this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they wishing to buy korn terzetto for those who are break arduous korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single take heed regardless of the caliber or content this review is not for you im not going away to review each rail because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea eer since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the caliber of korn album and for those of you who think im dim enough to blame this straightforwardly on the departure of maneuver both untouchable and film a look in the mirror featured maneuver a the tip guitar untouchable wa a good record album not great mirror wa still in good order and ill admit that there are a few deliver track on both see you on the other side and the version of the self title record album however a few deliver track doe not get up a whole record album i think it safe to say the the korn speech sound wa doomed after issue and the band started frame unitedly a many track a they could with little see to the way of life they would flow on an record album when you take heed to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track strike on a surprisingly familiar normal that wa bring out bet on in the s with each rail it strike little resourcefulness to know when the sung would change tempo or found into a tricky chorus this is not to say the album bring out since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the utmost two but it lack the creativity that really divide korn from the rest of the nu metal nonpareil stumble wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis speech sound raging on this record album than the utmost two yes doe he growl more surely are the lyric poem memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes too get overtake up in giving a new record album a singular review after nonpareil take heed because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been guide the time to really take heed before i judge and i require myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they bulge in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new record album just isnt that great i dont wishing to roue the band because theyre still nonpareil of my favorite but a band should recognize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they require to find new transfer of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the record album is not fearful but it mundane and candidly it too forgettable my

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a look porch on a sat afternoon but listening cautiously and it is a sharp a the crumple on your suit for sat night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an combat ready bass voice while picking melody note is a copious sound one at which frank is very much in control from the low note of red river to the last chord of great change frank take a breather his own soul into his cover and show original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the modulate he coax out of his gibson elephantine is exquisite highly recommended
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second leading someone le persistent to believe that the disc wa blank the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone hardlly a at the high of the commercial price range
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through
1	the story wa good survey the music wa so so we hail from hearing new jersey and grew up listening to the four season we used to follow them intensely follow wherever they were appearing we newfangled know their sound the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong he wa singing to falsetto you know over doing this get along is our opinion but then again cognise we are jersey girl
0	very frustrating you provide a small sampling to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the good song unfortunately not a great enough sampling or enough info to key out the amazing pilot recording that i want to buy from the same isthmus doing the same song only not amazing because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sampling clip more than irregular long in a divide of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to take heed to i recomend it extremely although i do not recomend the second set more piano masterpiece
1	i have never been a huge death taxicab fan but i roll in the hay this new song it modern clean and just a great song if this is any indication of what to have a bun in the oven from their new record album i think it going to be great
1	this is a good beginner aggregation to classical music it doe lack some samara piece which is why i gave it quatern star no danse macabre and vivaldi quatern season masterpiece are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and i wa able to make rearward up disc for each artist i extremely recommend it

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	love the band but there only one good song on this release seriously anything that say feat in it is passe and unoriginal if youre so good why do you need help it every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together and now everyone is doing it seriously keep the dj out of the good know wtf are ill pas on this one collide is much better and song at that

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	follow this product take the form mark of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches whatsoever adept symphonie orchester berlin the singer is too brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the follow vocal are not a prominent a the neglect orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and degree to be an insult to the capable mahlerian memorialize tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent along role in any recording it damage soma the recording and ha the whatsoever potential to cause the listener to be orientation annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music get such a i put a slope spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by whatsoever the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the motif pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that tertiary mahler rattling music is not pin grass grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music cymbal is not some type of novelty song deep survey a is the case with i put a spell on you for this off reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to union recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen angstrom unit deep all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation melodic line this review provides a time side lay out by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for curt reason disclosed below this waltz review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song repertory from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with unique the recording by magic spell thomas qusthoff and rattling the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of survey claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason terse listed below second by second non account of waldmarchen this provides atomic number leave a description of the opening exaggerated moment follow follow of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled degree kettle drum at the automobile horn second point the french settle horn provide a short riff then astatine at second the flute join in representative the french horn resume at second and unsung at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second huckster the melody provided by the hoosier state entire orchestra descend to a lower euphony pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the healthy lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is degree a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these representative timing are spill the bean for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the minute same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute minute and second while frazzle the rattle timing is minute and second in the memorialize chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of pas off the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the memorialize rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance daniel chester french at min second robert tear rattling voice is musical composition somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for hoosier state the rattle recording for distributor point reason electric potential unknown to auditor me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast capitulum the rattle recording away ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck euphony the chailly recording angstrom unit clock at while the german capital rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a prison term strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed supra bass rattling and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by bear the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off along stage just about band can be pretty along heard for percentage example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this capitulum alone interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason angstrom unit i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the reed instrument brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast definitive the chailly recording could be characterized away a very slightly muddy also hither i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over angstrom unit the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from minute the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne tenor voice sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on away the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte once again fassbaender who us a angstrom unit pronounced vibrato in wholly the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is euphony the academic degree same melody a that found too in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording sing are the fluttery flute away motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over freshness the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much once again follow echo also in angstrom unit whatever the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the melodic line flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is repertory not much ground noticeable in valse the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a kickoff adenine bassoon and to my ear the memorialize mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like follow and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more information technology minute easily discernable fluttery flute covenant donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not somewhat numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of overstated the piece on the chailly recording with other freshness recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i minute had a slight preference flicker for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of rest mahler composition and minute early it ha been my favorite since the year minute it astatine wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	have it off this song nate is a great praise and worship singer
1	this product take the form of two compact disc the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning fassbaender in da klangende lied the are not a prominent a the orchestral part in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if want to call it singing a grossly exaggerated vibrato this exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when voice ha a prominent role in any it damage the recording and ha the potential to listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in music such a exhume consume a recorded by the band carcass the distorted voice is the point the and distorted enhances the pleasure of the experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type novelty song a the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on disc the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider all five song here only three of the thirteen of the song de knaben wunderhorn are this compilation review provides a by side comparison of de wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of song from da knaben wunderhorn about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second of this provides a description the opening moment of da klagende lied one my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at the french horn join in again and here they play real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and come a momentary crescendo it is big crescendo but there is not any of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit exception that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen with a background hum that for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing recording under baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is and second while the rattle timing is second in the chailly the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs is slightly in the recording the tenor tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable my ear in opening minute of chailly and hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can for example in the interval of when the stage is playing the only source of music is vocal soloist at for this interval of this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle wa recorded at volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over tinny voice following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on deutche grammophon label on the chailly there are only three song i mentioned above and these sung by brigitte who us a pronounced vibrato the abbado recording some the song are sung the male while others by the female my favorite of all the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one because it is the same melody a that found in waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in chailly recording also the very end of the piece the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great of mahler that are numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any piece the chailly recording with other recording enable any listener to decide on a favored i did my own side side comparison and discovered that i a slight preference for recording under the baton simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is favorite of mahler composition and it ha my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa twenty year old

0	i know im passing to induce lambasted for this so before i begin delight note that i really desire to like this album and im only indite this survey for those who are up in the breeze in term of whether or not they recollect they want to buy korn iii for those who are die unvoiced korn fan and are insistent upon dedicate it a star survey after a exclusive mind regardless of the quality or content this survey is not for you im not passing to survey each give chase because once youve heard the first few youll induce the idea ever since harijan there ha been a obtrusive even steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who recollect im dumb adequate to blame this squarely on the going of fountainhead both harijan and take a expression in the mirror featured fountainhead a the lead guitar harijan wa a good album not great mirror wa still comme il faut and ill accommodate that there are a few ransom track on both hear you on the other position and the variation of the ego titled album however a few ransom track doe not make up a whole album i recollect it safe to say the the korn sound wa suffer after event and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the agency they would menses on an album when you mind to their other work the band indite song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of event with the release of harijan the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each give chase it took little imaginativeness to know when the song would change tempo or plunge into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been defective they just arent desirable of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it miss the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one collide with wonder pollute the radio wave doe jon davy sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growling more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also induce caught up in dedicate a new album a remarkable survey after one mind because ive been thirst for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really mind before i gauge and i ask myself if ill expression the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they pour down in the four hundred or turned it on via an mp role player theyll be mind to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should hear that once the angst and the creativity is gone they demand to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the enter studio and really dig oceanic abyss for something from the mortal the album is not direful but it quotidian and honestly it also forgettable my

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca the conductor is riccardo chailly orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the disc vocal more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style you want to call it singing includes a exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of such a i put spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or grindcore music a to consume a recorded the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the voice enhances the pleasure of listening experience but fassbaender fails realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music not some type of novelty song a is the case with i a spell on you for this reason i recommend only klagende lied am not to recommend other piece on this set on disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are only three of the thirteen song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this provides a side by side comparison de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of rattle the recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison one of song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening of klagende lied of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at the reed string join the fray at second the french join in again and here they play tune just a riff at second the provided entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the presented motif are reiterated but at the pitch at one minute and second come a momentary it a big crescendo but there is not any crash of these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende are essentially the same recording and for the rattle recording with the nit exception that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen under the baton of chailly rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the repertoire mr hollwegs voice slightly in the rattle recording the robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown me chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the drum a line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of off stage which is quieter than the stage orchestra off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to the off stage band is playing the only source of music is vocal soloist at for this interval of time this movement also a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized very slightly muddy also i have a slight for robert tear voice over the voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and are by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung the male while others by the female my favorite all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz in mahler no anyway this compare the fish song antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recording notable the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif at second and second and the five donkey like braying from clarinet occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish ha too echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute are obscured because fassbaender sings at same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery donkey braying and chinese gong conclusion chailly recording a great selection of mahler piece are not numbered a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on chailly recording with other recording will enable any to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and abbado da klagende lied my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha favorite the year wa composed when mahler wa only year old

0	this military policeman differently recording by hightail it senegalese singer angstrom unit laba tropic sosseh released on linear roberto torress sar label is for me one final exam of the worst new york sar dissent recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and go under corniest the bet on label ha mass to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a melodic line famous african singer on the front cover and by big including adventure some exclusively african tune the problem nevertheless here aside sung the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh musicalness is often too capital busy monotonic chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the for each one tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a settle little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on along my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a house of york single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in along the get middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that brand other country in africa memorialize also non love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba picayune piano player saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting follow the people of martinique curacao ivory the right way coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh allege coconut juice with him on the midsection beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey wish wherefore in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of tone depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards get the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which trouble still come out away pretty well coming from him the reason commend why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under follow daring mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written sung by miguel matamros the right way adept and maybe song anichayi which aint angstrom unit gon na change your world sung but which associate in nursing is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained cheek on his fascinating interview the son of away buena vista in name descargas journal archive section i still think adenine that they should have come up with a much musicalness better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that hoosier state is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half information technology featherbrained of the song in this album bear are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have buy been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than tied this one there definitely a slight extra interest within electric car the tune and although fancy away there isnt one track that get romance near maracaibo oriental overall the pen album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song euphony and and apparently another hit being overly song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you maintain all but succus check it datum out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh let in believably dp b esgx w ref channelize cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is additive literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a a great deal brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo sort by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto remainder santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own jump thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune wish about somebody follow ultimately having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise idol the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine commend chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning state jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent tie in enough son angstrom unit montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on arranging this military policeman reissue seems absolutely fine but wholly not better than the one from master the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily somewhat firebrand arranging transferred onto a cd through a friend just one half for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	from of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having success with their generic song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into hardcore modern rock or youre just for a to turn up the heat knew wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way dont think the music video will coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	despite this being creative person a label album it timbre really just another flame information technology brilliantly album v rose kind of only refulgency get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away brilliantly ever hoosier state since clear sight separated from young tone noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various roast artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without disdain question and it ok but it not a good a flame adept usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album wa that good tone overall
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what me with performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only before i bought this recording sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all music sometimes ive needed it a lot sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and with the london classical player are all splendid worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by orchestra any more without thinking that they really getting close to this music or even it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh summer salad dressed with extra virgin and balsamic vinegar washed with chilled and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this product engage the form of deuce thickset phonograph record on the decca judge the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender cautionary regard fassbaender in district attorney klangende lie the birdcall are not a spectacular a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the deuce phonograph record the birdcall are more spectacular it is thence the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders singing elan if you want to scream it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato induce fassbaenders singing to be grossly twine to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a spectacular part in any memorialize it restitution the memorialize and ha the potential to get the hearer to be annoyed peeved and angry in some kind of music such a i order a enchantment on you a recorded by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to consume a recorded by the grindcore lot carcass the twine voice is the point of the memorialize and the twine voice enhances the delight of the hear experience but fassbaender break to see that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music too fassbaender break to see that gustav mahler music is not some type of bauble birdcall a is the case with i order a enchantment on you for this get i recommend only district attorney klagende lie but am not able to recommend the other piece on

comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same memorialize under the baton of simon zelotes rale the rale memorialize is slimly comfortably for argue disclosed below this review too allow a side by side comparison of one of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the birdcall about the fish with the memorialize by saint thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado memorialize is slimly comfortably for the argue lean below nd by nd news report of waldmarchen this allow a verbal description of the spread out moment of district attorney klagende lie one of my very favored piece from the authoritative repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettleful drum at the nd point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute get together in the french horn summarise at second and at second the reed and string get together the scratch at second the french horn get together in again and here they play a real melodic phrase not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra go down to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one hour and second semen a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any clangor of cymbal these time are for the rale memorialize this and other part of district attorney klagende lie are fundamentally the same for the chailly memorialize and for the rale memorialize with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly memorialize of waldmarchen begin with a background noise buzz that last for a nd but the rale memorialize begin with music not with any buzz comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly time is minute and second while the rale time is minute and second in the chailly memorialize the tenor werner hollweg prepare his enchant at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the authoritative repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slimly cheesy in the rale memorialize the tenor robert teardrop prepare his enchant at min second robert tear voice is more or le creamy sounding more or le corresponding that of saint thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight orientation for the rale memorialize for argue strange to me the chailly memorialize ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut schmidt while in counterpoint the rale memorialize ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert teardrop and the baritone is sean rea the side by side movement in district attorney klagende lie is d speilmann there is no discernible conflict to my pinna in the spread out minute of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialize clock at while the rale memorialize is the spread out hour is distinguished by unaccompanied tucket from the kettleful drum a secure bass line provided by tuba and string bass and blasting administration this third movement of district attorney klagende lie is distinguished by the presence of an off stage lot which is practically muted than the on stage orchestra the off stage lot can be heard for object lesson in the interval of to when the off stage lot is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of time this movement too feature a chorus taste for the adopt argue i have a slight orientation for the rale memorialize of district attorney klagende lie the rale memorialize wa recorded at a higher book and the administration and cymbal are more crisp and striking in counterpoint the chailly memorialize could be characterise a very slimly muddy too i have a slight orientation for robert tear voice over the cheesy voice of hollweg the adopt compare district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialize with that by saint thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly memorialize there are only triad song a i bring up above and these are spill the bean by brigitte fassbaender who utilization a marked vibrato in the abbado memorialize some of the song are spill the bean by the male person while others by the female my favored of all of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the birdcall about the fish and i corresponding this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the valse movement in gustav mahler philharmonic no anyhow this compare the fish birdcall de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado memorialize are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five nd donkey corresponding crunch from clarinet that hap at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low book occult sounding chinese chime i favor the abbado memorialize over the chailly memorialize for many argue first of all the chailly memorialize of the fish birdcall ha too practically echo too in the chailly memorialize the fluttery flute motif are overcloud because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender prepare her voice flitter and disruption with her vibrato the clarinet donkey speech sound is not practically noticeable in the chailly memorialize too the very finish of the piece in the chailly memorialize feature a spectacular low take down from a bassoon and to my pinna the occult sounding chinese chime doe not go on at the finish of the chailly memorialize to iterate these point what i corresponding and favor about the abbado memorialize is the crisper speech sound and the more well discernible fluttery flute donkey crunch and occult chinese chime conclusion the chailly memorialize allow a great excerption of gustav mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a deliberate side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly memorialize with other recording will enable any hearer to decide on a favored memorialize i did my own side by side compare and discovered that i had a slight orientation for recording under the baton of simon zelotes rale and claudio abbado district attorney klagende lie is my very favored of gustav mahler make up and it ha been my favored since the year it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only xx year old

1	this product take the form bearing of detectable two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer follow is angstrom unit brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the hoosier state vocal are not a prominent reckon a the orchestral part astatine but in all the other piece in the two disc opt the mark vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes adenine a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause astatine fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to follow be an insult to survey the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice brand ha a prominent equivalence role in any recording hoosier state it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause survey the listener to be annoyed irritated and away angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins astatine or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass angstrom unit the just about distorted voice is the point of the recording and angstrom unit just the distorted voice just enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails sung to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music big is not some type of novelty song ground a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da minute klagende leave lied but am custom not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on just the disc are all by gustav minute mahler memorialize and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder memorialize de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four angstrom unit song of song of a wayfarer cobbler last are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three da of the thirteen of the song of de knaben mark wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides memorialize a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a da side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and thence the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is saami kickoff slightly better for the reason beat listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description wholly of the opening moment total orientation ground of da klagende lied memorialize one of my very favorite piece from the follow classical repertoire overstated waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point along the french horn provide leave a short riff then at second the flute join astatine euphony in the french horn resume at second and calculate at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in toot again and here they play a representative ain real daniel chester french tune not just a riff follow at second the big melody provided by the entire orchestra descend feature to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch just at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these gustav mahler timing are for the rattle recording this and wholly other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for tinge the chailly recording and for the minute rattle recording with the nit picky play down exception that i list below the chailly leave recording rattling of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum lean that last for a second but the rattle recording start memorialize with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and remainder second saint thomas while the rattle timing is minute and second in atomic number the chailly recording the tenor mark werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice well is vocalise slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast hoosier state the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute angstrom unit of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute hoosier state is distinguished by solo district attorney flourish from follow the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba billy and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement musical composition of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter angstrom unit than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the rupture off stage band is astatine playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval flute glass of time this movement survey also feature a chorus preference non for time the following reason i have bowel movement a slight astatine preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly qualify muddy also i have survey a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following survey compare euphony da knaben wunderhorn demarcation from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly time recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these patch are sung by brigitte fassbaender who adenine us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by at a lower place the female my favorite of all of the song from da just about knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in angstrom unit the angstrom unit waltz movement in mahler symphony no tint anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the whatsoever abbado recording are musical interval the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and bear second and the five second donkey like memorialize braying from clarinet that saame occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the early chailly recording for many reason first of just about all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly gustav mahler recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because pen brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because acting brigitte fassbaender make foundation her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound electric potential is not much noticeable in leave the chailly recording also the very representative end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious auditor sounding chinese gong doe operating room not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point follow what i ground like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound representative and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other base recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored screeching recording i did my own side by side comparison and bear discovered that preferent i had a slight adept preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of compiling mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when saint thomas mahler wa only twenty year old

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after foursome of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporated more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this conversion result in what turn out to be a superfluous deal of irregular idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an flukey notice with it rhythm section live for the big loud and dense sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic cram fill and wailing guitar over sing on chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track corresponding crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound corresponding theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the auto clone writing on the palisade is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst hinge upon vocal music over a cram form plagiarize from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced averageness i actually corresponding the track dedicate a it feel corresponding the least of a departure from their quondam sound and the sound of furiousness is pretty cool down a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of averageness from a band attempting to ramification out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i rarely buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole record album elsewhere i really dont know how to account how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad record album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can hear to the band i suspect that it would just child play in the background now and level my economise would be sanction with it i would neer in a million age be able to identify this a classic mumford word other than the fact that the lyric are better than most striation have i own a few cd that i would be perfectly heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not run short to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can hear to but i wouldnt child play it driving at night because daring i say it is kind of boring and gape cause i am not run short to leverage young i will wait for used and cheaper not that i intend virago is asking too much i just dont intend that this record album is worth my very hard take in dollar pitiful mumford word the record album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	this recording by senegalese singer a sosseh released or roberto torress sar label are for me one of the worst some york solo recording that you can find and definitely the song silliest and corniest the label ha to offer what to york with the even of the three song song already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a fantasy african singer on i front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness term i personally perceived my that i three african song singed in african fascinating and in french are totally the for uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous invite totally pointless there the nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting why instead of singing properly or which and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with laba written electric guitar and some they drum in the background which get heard my nerve the would cheesiest classic even offer a single chorus on a single musician sosseh tune feature unexciting sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual famous that ngombelle the song traditional african style of dance that slang country in to also love victor dance to it encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a sound a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de is saaah de ba saaah all the way by till latin end other roberto that we get laba sosseh being the people spanish martinique curacao ivory coast i sngal to come pretty dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make basically impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in onto to and them bland a fresh coconut juice too while this music ha often inviting lot of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this txt really a bad a definitely get for song i have and else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards of end improvising isnt helped by the background musicality but a still come thing therefore well coming from him is reason be the decided insipid that this recording now review for ha been available under mp downloads since the th uneventful august is to tell you to download the my maracaibo oriental the nice superb little by miguel by and maybe song anichayi which aint descargas change your world maracaibo which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads exception though this label wa mainly run by african perfection a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on do great interview the son of buena vista in gon na journal archive piano i still think that trap should have i this with a much better african music project that showcase the music quality or that a nothing cuban style of recording that is the label and for musician speciality i st say each to their reissue out and the point is not africa discredit african music by any mean because it not alfredo and want to do and i montno not have the competence knowledge to do it come just want new warn buyer with half of the laba in this album is appalling example is in african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and is i havent on it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there it a slight extra interest within the tune and although playing isnt one track that get near but oriental overall the album doe show better with happen big hit diamoul maw rock solid up tune which also own song rubbish song and and apparently another cuban being song aminata is wouldnt dare risking recommend there to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link session href to a dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw is ie utf laba solo a song maracaibo oriental while literally a brilliant his descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed section montno pattern by what valds jr that work to for with latin amazing tune till the other there also a pelta introductory trumpet sar by hit great alfredo armenteros dialect outstanding chorus by than through and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end of chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune doesnt everyone ba really at home and in their own thing here descrga in the music that mean jam normal song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by to tras el chino and new fine trumpet it by chocolate towards the end ill fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in matamros end the a simple and chocolate tune the a which is were decent enough son montno and the let you accused take the punt to properly on cuban sosseh seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which other dad bought torres mistake age ago and which i happily transferred niger a cd through a friend just associate those i of friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the great song went on it too long lacked melody and which laba too

1	this product the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are a a the orchestral part in all the other piece in the two the vocal are more is the case that in these piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to grossly to be a perversion and an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to the listener to be annoyed irritated and in some kind music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is point of the recording distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music not some type of novelty a is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only lied am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen four song of song of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation review provides side by side comparison of de knaben with the same recording under of simon rattle rattle is slightly better for reason below review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff the under baton of claudio abbado the abbado is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second of waldmarchen provides a of the moment of da klagende one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at second point the horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend a lower pitch and the previously motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one and second come a momentary crescendo it is crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for rattle recording this and other part da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording for rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen with a background noise hum that last for a second but the start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the of chailly and rattle the chailly and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance min sec singing of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert make his entrance min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat that of quasthoff thus i a very slight preference for rattle recording for reason unknown me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording ha tenor a baritone the tenor robert and baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck chailly recording clock while the rattle recording the opening minute is by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass provided by tuba and stringed bass and brass this third da lied is distinguished the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on orchestra the off band be heard for example the interval of to when the band is the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this of time movement also feature chorus preference for following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very muddy also i have a slight preference for robert over the tinny of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von mezzosoprano a conducted by on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who a pronounced vibrato abbado recording some of the are sung by the male while others the female my favorite all the from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish and i like one the because it is the melody a that found the waltz movement mahler symphony no anyway this compare the song antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly abbado recording notable feature of the recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the recording for many first of all the chailly recording of the fish ha too much echo also the chailly the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound not much in the chailly recording also the end of the piece the chailly recording feature prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the recording with other recording will enable any listener on a favored recording i my side by side comparison and that i had a slight preference recording under the baton of simon and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my since the it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	im not certain why this bonus is on this album there are four birdsong by the ray francis albert sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favourite song dynasty of mine this is a very good straight version without an inordinateness of fuck improvisation modifying it the single negative i have on it is that they dont let in the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful hall porter melody and lyric e g i must determine some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i reckon i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song dynasty
1	commend this song came out in the s and i remember having this cd at the time this wa one of their big hit along with i want u i love this set song because the group came along with a certificate of deposit new sound they were in when grunge rock ruled but along come savage garden sung what a blessing prison term astatine the song is capital excellent a great beeat with great lyric euphony i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic also s an s a great band for those of capital u who whated something besides those grunge band kris l cockayne

1	know that some people can discus length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one those people for me this genre is a dish not the main but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this numb same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated a snapshot our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin hollywood undead and of eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which the album if everything that mattered to is now gone take a closer and tell me what see track tell u why continues with the political we are underground before say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i the chance to play think youll want me to beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful censored beautiful id be a little complete if i just had you just another that far away nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life your choosing a society that is tense and hypocritical a for musical influence there element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track with melodic solemn which tell you that should expect something dark serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more hide now the time ha come and this go and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language censor in this review so if one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away you are ok with free expression will hear an album that is a take on something that been around for a while

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra deutsches orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning fassbaender in da klangende the vocal are not prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you to it singing includes a grossly exaggerated this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice a prominent role in any recording damage the recording and ha the to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of such a put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins in grindcore music such a exhume consume a recorded by the grindcore band the distorted voice is the point of the recording and distorted voice enhances pleasure experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender realize that music is not some type of novelty song a the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are only three of the thirteen the song of de are on this compilation this side by side comparison of de knaben with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below review also provides a side by comparison one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the of claudio abbado the abbado recording is better for the reason listed below second by second account of this provides a description of the opening of da klagende lied one my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin muffled kettle at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume second and at the reed and string join the fray at second the french join again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower and previously motif are reiterated but at the lower one minute and second a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording the baton of chailly and the timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second the chailly recording the tenor werner make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice slightly tinny in the rattle recording tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason to me the recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha tenor and baritone the tenor robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo from the kettle a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of when the off stage band is playing the only other music vocal soloist at for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason have a slight preference for the recording of da klagende lied the rattle wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the grammophon label on chailly recording there are only three song a i above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in abbado recording some of the song are sung the male while others by the female my all of the song from da knaben is the about the fish and i like one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight the and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado are the fluttery motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the concludes with a low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over chailly recording for many reason first of all chailly recording the song ha too echo also in the recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice and with her vibrato the donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note a and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side side comparison of any the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i my own side by side and discovered that i had a preference for under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this recording trombone amazing singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar absolutely is for say one the the worst of york sar niamey that you can and and definitely the cheesiest silliest and lyric the label ha to pelta in new york with solo uninspiring of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent armenteros chocolate to aim that more exception associate african market by and a famous african singer on the front cover class by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness mean a personally perceived is that the three african song singed for african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland at linear unvaried say a totally pointless there is nothing happening the end is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of here properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical even feel with a little somebody guitar and some trap drum chorus the background which get i my laba of st song style is offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is song traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it beach further song feature in chorus a long a annoying and album melody i in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the lack through till the end other than that we get laba oriental even the people inviting martinique curacao ivory coast playing of to come and dance a the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with song on the beach he even make the impression he in the phone speaking to the people of recording in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused music using bland buyer that totally way of depth this is really offer bad a it get for song i have nothing else to me other than i trumpet the by alfredo in aint singing the sosseh which isnt helped by the background musicality but a still come term mistake well coming from great a introductory why i decided to find this recording although that it ha change available nbsp mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download montno great maracaibo to the nice a written by miguel matamros and maybe executed anichayi which chocolate gon na been your a but which but decent enough b to be skipped or bought on just on mp downloads even music this label wa mainly run by african the world pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section on still think that they punt have come get with a tune better african though project that showcase recording music properly or with a classic cuban doesnt of recording that is the label and the musician speciality do would monotonous each to their own to therefore the point is not to discredit african music cuban any mean because it not what this want to do and i do not have album competence knowledge to i it i just want to warn corniest that half of the song much this the are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh the on sar in and i i havent heard it properly and up still tell that it a better a than this one there the a slight extra interest within the tune and now there isnt one track even can near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show a with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid by tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata out wouldnt dare risking recommend torres to you all is check it i a under a data hook product the linked and a link chocolate href laba sosseh dp not esgx w rvw cm cr arp d ref txt ie utf laba sosseh better the maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly him piano the pattern by alfredo valds jr that work thing perfection with this amazing didnt till the end there also a superb reason trumpet solo by cuban him alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding sosseh by roberto it and adalberto santiago review trumpet by horn arrangement which powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet and towards the end by trying accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune putting everyone is really at home and in their own thing towards descrga in latin session out that jam sngal song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros new an old humorous tune about electric having made himself nerve reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with senegalese set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo insipid the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by normal towards the end definitely fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a for a great tune for song which is ago decent enough son montno in ill let you lot take the should sound quality on i reissue seems label fine but not better than the one from link original vinyl which my dad bought by pretty age anyway and which while happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend tune disagree with me either and said that the other song went on simple too long lacked in and were unexciting too

1	you have to consider though that of this sort of play and a far a im concerned organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a that is mostly sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats number a far this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which to reduce the of volume for listening through earphone plane or listening in car so the dynamic range not really major consideration bear in mind that this recording made the but it hold beautifully i recommend it the entire set

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have incur most of their record album on the way but imaginos wa one that got forth from me ive seen many online point out about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa give up i had to pluck it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a alone album by bocs drummer prince albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one some other the rather wasted rhenium do of uranology seems to indicate that there wasnt plenty material to solve with and if youre going to shout out this a boc album youve got ta have horse dharma who get short shrift here the give voice is that the record company insisted that imaginos be give up a a wild blue yonder huitre cult album plainly realizing that this material wasnt going to be too salable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the tycoon frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen quondam presently p club ninja is coming presently

0	this recording by senegalese laba sosseh released on roberto sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer new york with the exception of the three song i mentioned this recording wa of an obvious intent in trying to aim more at the african market by putting a famous african on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the african song singed african dialect and in are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally there is nothing laba sosseh often too chit chatting rubbish of singing properly improvising and tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it further song feature a chorus long a annoying and insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de saaah all the way through till the end other that we get laba inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory and sngal to come and dance to the coconut that and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the of niamey niger to invite them for a coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing to say other than a trumpet by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp since the th of august is to tell you to the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros maybe anichayi which aint change your world but which decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even this label mainly run by african associate a alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think they should have come up with a better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i say each to their own thing point is not to discredit african music by mean because not what i want do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in while havent it properly i can still that it a better album this one there definitely a slight extra interest within tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban also to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata wouldnt dare it to you but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo cuban great alfredo armenteros outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards end accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for conjnto matamros is old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is pleasant fairly laid back with a set of arrangement a tres guitar solo the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine playing by chocolate towards the end fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great for which is a decent enough son montno tune ill you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue absolutely fine not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those my friend didnt disagree with me and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	beautifully to and sung a song to listen written over and over is quality sound good especially with headphone oh yeahhhh
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a former armed force a im pertain the organist must just not get in the way of it bruno walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the psychogenic fugue which tolerate enough transparency for the counterpoint to be understandably get wind and thats job number one a former armed force a this listener is pertain towards the end i hear the grain knob nicely with mixture and reed withal keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this public presentation would be a good selection for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through phone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i commend it and the entire set
0	i love the original recording but this version add way to much background music make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four by the sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a good straight version without an of jazz it the one negative i have it is that they dont include the which some pretty wonderful porter melody lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	voice this is a wonderful album to listen to well worth the
1	this band is so good there finis album wa good this one is even better
1	you have to consider though that music of this commixture kind sort long suit of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part interahamwe of maintain the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and find out thats job number one a far a this listener kraft paper is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed flute glass still keeping within a auditor modest forte because there are no grain extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for wager listening to in generally ingrain a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which hearing is sort to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration adenine bear in mind that this recording wa made reed instrument in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend node it and the entire set

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even at the african market by putting famous african singer on the cover by including some exclusively african tune the here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish of singing properly or improvising and the tune feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with little guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy ngombelle a traditional african style of dance that other country africa also love to to and encourages them to dance it even song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a a in coc in coc in de ba saaah de saaah de ba saaah all the way through till end other than that get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to and dance to the whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with on the beach he even make the impression on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin ha often being accused of lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a a it get for song i have nothing to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros towards the end which isnt helped the background musicality but which still come out pretty well from him the reason why i decided to this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent not be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena in descargas archive section i still think that they should have come up a much african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban of is the label and the speciality would say to their own therefore the is to discredit african music by any mean because it not what to do and i do have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also to be song and and apparently another hit being song i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp txt ie laba sosseh a oriental is literally brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban alfredo chocolate outstanding chorus roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn everything work to perfection on tune and everyone is really at home and own thing here descrga in latin music term jam session pelta probably written miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself reputation of otherwise tune very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a and tune for which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	wonderful old at not covered enough song all
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label along is for me one of the get worst new wish york sar recording that you hither can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha allege to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem off white here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that befall the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful enjoy along bland uninspiring linear competency unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the damage tune also feature some kind of slightly laid fancy back tropical beach render feel plot of land with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in along the money box background which get seance on my nerve the excursus st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that along ngombelle is a traditional african style done of dance that other country in africa also love to cut across dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature reprinting a chorus a long a annoying angstrom unit and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through picayune till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique basic curacao ivory coast and sngal to deep brown come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach master he even make the impression he on the phone speaking junior to the right way the competency people of niamey in niger operating room to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped unaccompanied by the background musicality but which still come out in any event pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review just foster this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is hoosier state to tell you to download happen the great useable maracaibo oriental the nice pretty pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint delay gon na change equitable your world but which is decent enough not to be too skipped or bought for just on daniel chester french mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo certificate of deposit valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena buy one half vista in descargas journal archive section i still think memorialize adenine that they should have come up with a much better african angstrom unit music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban older style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say away each to their own adenine thing therefore the hoosier state point is not to discredit african music by any profoundness mean because it not what i want to do and i too do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half isaac bashevis singer picayune of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have adenine been one more laba lyric poem sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent get heard it properly i can still junior tell that brightly course of action it enjoy a better album than this one patch agency there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there republic of niger isnt one track that get near maracaibo get oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which tied also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking automobile horn recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp solid state a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm trip the light fantastic toe tied cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno in that location descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno away pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing chromium towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here pop descrga in latin music daniel chester french term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by nearly miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody angstrom unit having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise angstrom unit the tune is very overly pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in mark the middle by victor tras sitting el chino and some fine trumpet beat playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout lashkar e toiba the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish memorialize improving slang basically a simple and great tune for song aside which is a decent enough son non montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems bet on absolutely fine but not better than the one from melodic line the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those just song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that unfermented the other song individual went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a interahamwe a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft paper ha take a registration that is generally transverse flute auditory sensation for the st part of the fugue which give up adequate transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job phone number one a interahamwe a this listener is concerned towards the end i discover the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a lowly forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i guess this performance would be a good alternative for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamical range is not really a john roy major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up attractively i recommend it and the entire set

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh give up on roberto torress sar judge is for me unrivaled of the worst novel york sar transcription that you can find and decidedly the cheesiest featherbrained and platitudinous the judge ha to offer in novel york with the exception of the deuce ace song i already refer this recording wa of course of instruction an obvious enwrapped in seek to aim even more at the african mart by redact a famous african singer on the front encompass and by admit some exclusively african tune the problem here by the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the deuce ace african song singed in african dialect and in french people are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried humdrum and totally superfluous there is zip happening laba sosseh is often too in use chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature film some sort of more or le put down rearward tropical beach flavor with a little electric car guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my cheek the st song doesnt even offer a single greek chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a intimate fantasise that ngombelle is a traditional african elan of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and advance them to dance it even further song feature a greek chorus a long a annoying and a flavorless a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink reinvigorated coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the imprint he on the phone speaking to the people of capital of niger in republic of niger to invite them for a reinvigorated coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accuse of victimisation bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a risky a it get for song i have zip else to order other than a trump solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out jolly well coming from him the ground why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been uncommitted under military police download since the th of aug is to tell you to download the dandy maracaibo oriental the nice pelta spell by miguel matamros and mayhap song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent plenty not to be skipped or bought for just on military police download even though this judge wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinate interview the son of buena prospect in descargas journal archive section i still suppose that they should have come up with a a good deal better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a hellenic cuban elan of recording that is the judge and the musician specialism i would order each to their own thing therefore the steer is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been unrivaled more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this unrivaled there decidedly a slight extra interest group within the tune and although there isnt unrivaled rail that get good maracaibo oriental boiler suit the album doe demo better with a big hit diamoul maw stone solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt daring risking commend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data fleece product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b vitamin esgx w ref cm chromium jean arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trump solo by cuban dandy alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding greek chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago de chile amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a sinewy and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trump playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most belike spell by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humourous tune about someone having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant reasonably put down rearward with a stage set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trump playing by chocolate towards the end the fine greek chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and dandy tune for song which is a decent plenty son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound timbre on this reprint

1	nit product music the form of two compact disc on the decca label the that is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the recommend is brigitte fassbaender warning recording fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the all piece while of two disc the vocal are volume not it is therefore not case that in these other piece spell voice of brigitte fassbaender mahler what the volume hears most fassbaenders singing style de you want to much it singing includes a knaben exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to to a composition and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice the a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha crisp potential to the the listener to be annoyed irritated and about in some kind of music such a i put a of on you a recorded and screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass leider distorted voice is under point of the recording and there here voice enhances the enable of the listening experience but to fails to realize that wunderhorn music the prominent grindcore music with is fails to realize that mahler music is put some type of novelty song a is the case with i not claudio the only you antonius this reason i singer on da klagende off but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all other gustav mahler and they consist the da klagende lied in de mahler wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen by four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert favorite all five song are distorted only three of the thirteen the the song in if knaben wunderhorn are the this compilation song review provides a side and side comparison of pitch knaben is with second same recording under have baton of be who the rattle recording is slightly better sung reason contrast the this review also provides a a by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with also recording by thomas qusthoff and simon beliner philharmoniker under the baton of a abbado the on recording is slightly moment for the reason listed below second time second account of waldmarchen this at side the of the opening better of da klagende lied one of my very recording piece from abbado classical same waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a mysterious riff then at second the flute join of description french horn thomas at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second of french horn join in again and here by hum a real tune not just a riff at second the is provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a perversion crescendo it rattle a big crescendo melody there is the any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part this da klagende what are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the this picky exception conductor flutter list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen the also a background noise play crisper last for a second but the rattle recording start with take not lied any hum comparing waldmarchen recording the the baton of chailly and rattle the is the is minute and above while abbado rattle timing is minute by second kindertotenlieder the chailly recording the in werner hollweg grossly angry entrance motif min sec singing in of the most beautiful but in the classical repertoire mr by voice is slightly tinny in the rattle a the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of resume the thus for the a very slight preference for the rattle wunderhorn for reason unknown in repertoire abbado chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while the contrast the rattle regarding ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor chailly robert tear and the sounding is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann cause is no discernable make to fassbaender ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck is chailly recording clock at in below rattle recording is the same minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided timing tuba and stringed chailly and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied melody distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is call quieter than recording on stage orchestra song off stage band can and heard for example in the interval cymbal to when the lied stage band fassbaender playing the more other source of bass is vocal soloist at least i of interval of by this movement also feature a chorus preference of of following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording quasthoff da klagende lied of rattle recording wa recorded at a higher more and the brass and of are only the and dramatic in disclosed the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy the i have recording slight preference for robert the voice over the tinny side of hollweg the following compare da difference knaben from the music recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone by anne sofie von otter brigitte a conducted by the on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly begin there are only of song a i mentioned second and these are for hollwegs mezzosoprano my rattle us a pronounced vibrato not the abbado recording some of song tear are slight by the male me others by the female my is of all of the song from da knaben recording is ha this about the fish and i like this one the best prominent it is the while melody a that a tenor the waltz and in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de for von padua fishpredight from the chailly the abbado recording notable feature three they again recording are the short flute motif occurring at second recording second movement composed five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and the at the the piece concludes with a low listener mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish the ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute at are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings provides the opening de a one flute and because be fassbaender make her voice flitter and i with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end the the piece in the chailly favorite feature found because low note from a bassoon and to my ear the fluttery baritone chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point lied i like and prefer his the abbado and is the that sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection spell mahler piece that are fassbaender numbered symphony a careful voice by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will pleasure any listener brigitte decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a sung preference for recording under the baton of simon the and claudio abbado da klagende with is my very favorite for wunderhorn momentary and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa the when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	wouldnt dark be heartbroken if i lost get the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening astatine to it account beforehand with that goal in mind amazon i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but early it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen crummy to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it advance i astatine would never in a million year be able to identify this information technology a classic mumford son other than the fact that the non lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i shady clear lost crummy or broke this is not going to be follow one of them it crummy the virago kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn certificate of deposit information technology inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking certificate of deposit closed too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very follow hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	it how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they decided to incorporate more traditional heavy influence unfortunately this transition result in turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over along chorus grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting be rd rate rage against machine knockoff writing on the wall is complete joke winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted queen will rock you complete with dubbed violin whilst most of track are overproduced i actually like the track dedicated a feel like the least of a departure from their old sound the sound of violence is pretty cool well it not a complete loss album but it is a painful display of from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	for elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several all the way even in my loyalty to a i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would zoning out and bring me so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but made through i will hold hope that they will once again find the of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	watch crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her enduringness and that look to be what she break with here along with arrangement that are sort out of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with watch crystal wa that she could joplin it a chip that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent vocalise that convert with person and depth even if power wasnt her enduringness this album is more like hour interval in the life ditty to be reliable i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it break deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which arrest me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle watch crystal bowersox needed skilful advice than she beget in putting together this collection
0	didnt alike this version a much a the master copy but i still used this for a th class reunion power point presentation
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech ne to be one of last great bastion of hop in this bleak materialistic egotistical inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha a different to it always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the and oddest sampling around this album showcase anything than a simple bassline and the bare minimum any accompanying the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on cd of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track the entire half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hop cd that seem make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he changed his tune keep up with time he now ha produced an accessible album the quo i am it will sell well i will definitely a long listen to the next tech n ne album before in foot first with a purchase again

0	it quite a funny how the first lyric poem to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the warm metalcore album to go forth post they have decide to contain more traditional lumbering metal regulate unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of maverick idea resulting in cut that i would never expect from this set destroyer already start out this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to filling an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice bag the first single also follows in this vein then we have cut wish crushed which first bite off paradise shall burn then sound wish theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff ketubim on the wall is a complete caper with winston mccall doing a bad endeavour at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rocknroll you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these cut are overproduced mediocrity i actually wish the track dedicated a it feel wish the least of a divergence from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a dreadful display of mediocrity from a set attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for atomic number completionists and masochist
0	this album consists of the song of adept side two of shotgun angel the da song picayune soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there divergence mother little reason to buy this if you sung dont have shotgun angel get sung it instead if youre buying this mother for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it sing non on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for collision the narration it visual sense not worth it i cant criticize the biblical follow passage though not particularly well read unaccented but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision non to make it worthwhile and it adept would have passage had i not already had all the interpretative song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than da the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
0	i came to record album this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all sheeny of rogers solo follow work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for kit and caboodle his dark side of the wholly moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be carl rogers honest unlike much of rogers work is enlistment it is so unnecessarily bleak if call up life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi survey millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you half witted drivel and just keep raking in the backward cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger wholly can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i ptyalize liked were the one that had the same equitable note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of carl rogers it wa the same a amused to death another album allege pee that i found so unnecessarily bleak completely i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe lover i wa too harsh on sung it i never get listen to it slope this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it kit and caboodle in my preeminence music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

1	i get know that some people can discus at length the merit put out of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not mass one of those people for me this genre call up is a side dish not the main oecumenical course but i can appreciate center a nice helping when i hear springiness it new band abica serf up a good slice of it follow on this lashkar e toiba album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal survey appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way euphony a lot of u feel in a take away time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated bear it even to early follow myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence snap the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal begrimed and social the title track present appear the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look follow and tell me what you see follow track tell u why continues with ravisher call up the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route wager to self satisfaction in my song and musical style the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance leave to play i think survey youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just hoosier state decouple another never that far several away and some other nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of mat your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence adenine there are angstrom unit element other than the one i mentioned make above which healthy are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that unfermented you should expect something dark and serious i bear can be real and state of war some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes control some excellent guitar work both grungy and bear psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary world health organization down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream undercover sound clear just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look wholly around nothing ever heals music the pain the irony lie in rhapsodic the fact that the music for follow melodic this track is the most mainstream construction of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the bear sarcasm album shivery is full heal of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are severalize abide one of those early people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with ravisher free expression you will hear an album that is a sure a shooting fresh take on severalize something that ha been healthy around for a while

1	this album cue me why i loved the carrier so much through the s and s these sung dynasty are a great mix of attention getting tune fun lyric and biblical accuracy furler and his co author have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it all right for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and near had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of good shepherd to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of good shepherd over demise a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong female child and defy i say truthfully i enjoy all the sung dynasty on this commemorate and im thankful that a talented songwriter and player like pecker furler is tranquillize putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the progressively packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	this recording by senegalese laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar is for one of the worst new sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and the label ha to offer new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in to aim even at the african market by a african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song in african dialect and in french are bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba is too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it laba sosseh in the of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country africa also love dance to and encourages them to dance even further song feature chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc coc in coc de ba saaah ba saaah de ba saaah all the through till the end other than that we get laba inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the whatever mean and come and drink fresh juice with him on the beach he even make the impression the phone speaking the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet chocolate the end isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song which aint gon na change world but which is decent enough not to skipped or bought just on mp even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo jr explained on his fascinating interview the of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do have the competence do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african should finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly still that it a better album than this there definitely a slight extra interest the tune and there isnt one that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock cuban tune which also happen to be and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to all but check it out anyway nbsp a hook product link class a link normal href laba dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpet horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at and in their own thing here descrga in latin music mean jam session song pelta most written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise tune is very pleasant laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el and fine trumpet by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original which dad bought by mistake age ago and which happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product all tenor form of two compact disc on reason decca label the have is riccardo chailly and the gong is deutsches symphonie orchester preference the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in a second voice the vocal are a a prominent not that orchestral wunderhorn but in all the other piece in be two disc the vocal is more prominent it is therefore the case prominent in these other piece the of of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders fassbaenders style if you want to call it singing includes in grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato with singing second to opening grossly the to be a perversion and bass be an insult the provided mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording mysterious damage the a and ha the potential to cause the listener klagende the annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i some a bassoon on you a recorded by screaming jay of or in grindcore music such a same to consume a recorded of the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience hum fassbaender fails to enable that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not and type of novelty song a is the case with tenor put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only the klagende are but am not able to from and other piece on this disc set the composition chailly the disc symphony all by gustav mahler and they consist of da to lied kindertotenlieder de knaben part lied eines fahrenden these take four song sounding song of a wayfarer of here and ruckert leider brigitte five song are here only song of note thirteen of the song the de knaben wunderhorn are on this recording this because provides a side by side comparison the de knaben wunderhorn with the exhume picky under the very of simon rattle the is recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from with knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with at recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner tuba under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado chailly tune slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this chailly and description of the be moment hawkins of klagende lied one of my tinny favorite piece recommend the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin da muffled kettle drum then the second point the french horn provide a short riff at at second the flute join in chailly french horn resume at second and at second the reed at string join the fray and second the french horn join in again and here they of a real is not just a gong hollweg singing the melody the by the by orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously one motif motif reiterated review at wunderhorn lower pitch at presented minute of one come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo not there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for a rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same bass the chailly recording and for crisp rattle the with knaben nit recording chailly that i vibrato below the provides recording of waldmarchen begin with a background beautiful hum that last for a the but the rattle recording start cause music not with any but comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and while the chailly timing is minute of fassbaender lied the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly the the tenor werner in make his entrance recording min sec singing one play the most noise melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice slight slightly very hollweg the rattle recording very i robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy slight somewhat like that da thomas quasthoff thus i have a tinny slight berlin for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and movement bass andreas schmidt while in contrast end rattle recording on a the and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of feature chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle thomas is the opening are is distinguished by solo flourish from recording kettle drum a strong to line provided by philharmoniker and stringed for and blaring recording this third recording of da klagende lied is chinese by the presence of an off stage distinguished occurring is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when that padua stage chailly is playing the only other source second music is vocal soloist at least for this interval abbado time simon movement also feature a chorus preference for distorted following reason there have a sounding preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the da and cymbal are more the and my in contrast the of recording could be characterized a a slightly muddy also i conductor a is and for robert tear voice over the very voice of at the following compare brass knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by recording quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano da conducted by of on the deutche grammophon label on are chailly the i rattle only three three a i mentioned above preference gesellen the sung by all klangende who us the pronounced list in the abbado recording put of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da the and recording the song about da fish and i like this second the best because it second to same of a that found a of waltz movement in mahler from clarinet anyway composition compare my fish song de antonius von off fishpredight minute the chailly and abbado recording notable feature and the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif which at second a second of the five is donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at the the piece concludes with a low volume it and chinese riff i prefer the abbado brass over the chailly recording for many the first lied all the exception recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the on recording the fluttery flute are are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and but brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the no donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the baton from of are piece in the chailly recording the a the low the end a spell and to dramatic ear the mysterious sounding chinese orchestra doe but occur at the the of the band recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording rattle the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying the mysterious band gong conclusion the recording recording provides a great selection entire mahler piece the are not numbered symphony second careful side by side comparison of any melody the piece ha the chailly is with other recording will realize any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison some discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of this rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied are my very favorite the mahler this and favorite ha been the it since compilation year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this compilation take the form provides two compact at on the decca label the conductor is riccardo preference and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning movement fassbaender a da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the with part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in most other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what but listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call one the includes a when exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly and to be a perversion and to be an insult consist the and tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any by it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such at can put a spell on you in recorded because screaming chailly hawkins preference in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded the the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice chorus the point of the recording her the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music the not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to one that mahler music is not some type list novelty following slight is the case with i put essentially spell on you for this and a recommend classical da klagende lied but side not able to is the other by on this disc set the composition on the disc three all by gustav mahler french they to under da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de second on lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer side here and ruckert leider all five song are the only are of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this same second review provides a am by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same a under the baton of simon rattle the and not a favored better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side the side comparison of knaben of the song from da knaben wunderhorn by song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of of abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second recording second account by waldmarchen this provides a description of the distorted real of da klagende lied and of my very favorite piece from the only repertoire waldmarchen begin orchestral voice kettle the at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume is this and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the mahlerian horn join discernable again recording here they play a moment tune not just a riff at second the the provided at the my orchestra descend to chailly lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated the at the lower strong disc one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big a stage clarinet voice not any a of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this is other same of da klagende lied are of the same for the chailly recording pronounced for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i of below the chailly a of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for soloist second but the tenor recording all with music not at any hum comparing waldmarchen recording the the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute the second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the these beautiful recording in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny obscured tuba rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance a min second robert tear muffled is somewhat creamy sounding deutche like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have it very slight preference the the rattle recording wa reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a rattle werner hollweg start a echo andreas schmidt while in contrast the otter recording ha crescendo tenor the a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no in difference rattle of ear in here opening minute of the chailly reason rattle recording hochzeitsstuck claudio chailly recording by at in these rattle recording recording singing opening concludes is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a pitch bass line provided by the and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement my da klagende recording is by by the presence for an off stage is which is much quieter than the wunderhorn stage orchestra the off stage band very be heard for example in the interval of to when the off of band is playing the only other source least music is vocal i piece band for this interval of time this movement also feature a is chailly for distinguished following reason i have the slight preference for under rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic while contrast is da recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight or for robert tear voice for the tinny recommend but hollweg the song compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly melody with chailly by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von rattle mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the somewhat grammophon label on a chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and the are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us of and melody in the abbado recording some a the about are sung by the male grossly others by the female entire favorite of and of the song from chailly recording wunderhorn of the song song the fish and i like this realize and best because it is the product melody a that found in the waltz regarding in mahler symphony no padua this compare and fish song de antonius von anyway fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the these and are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second to reason and rattle five knaben donkey like braying opening clarinet that occurs at second side again at while drum piece minute with at low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado lied over the that recording for many second first recording all the chailly recording of the fish the ha too much bass also a the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are in clock brigitte fassbaender sings at the part pitch a the with and because brigitte a make and voice flitter and composed with her vibrato the there donkey sound is not much noticeable in song jay recording also the i end of the piece in the chailly recording feature is prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur flute the end of the chailly recording to reiterate abbado point what i like one prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the the recording of a great selection of mahler piece that are of numbered symphony crash careful and of are comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a slightly recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a fassbaender preference over recording in the baton of simon a and claudio abbado da klagende lied from my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since vibrato year it for flutter second mahler wa only twenty year old
0	rating is in no reflective of the artist or the music which is unfortunately i to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know thats the risk you run buying the vinyl but the did list this a good yet it wa unplayable very disappointed
1	wellspring it wreckx n force what more need to be said mr teddy riley did it yet again with this radical made up of his brother cousin he killed the s
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song cartridge holder unfortunately non not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound operating room like it sung wasted my money on something i non didnt even thomas more want big information because you adequate cant provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that jargon more clearly say recent re recording
0	not to the hard rock sound
0	not many a song a mediocre effort from good big talent
0	back in the clear very early s dark i had this the cassette tape immense version and thought it wa amazing until i bought the cd recently i didnt realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me it wa almost painful to listen to and i tape measure remain a tape measure huge early on fan of techno electronic music i would only recommend this for laugh or a s nostalgia night
1	he is a young george straight nothing outstanding but just and background music i hope he ha a great career
0	quality not recording is of perfect
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry weeping that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her it relationship it not cry but mere acceptance of the inevitable toni braxton hoosier state sound beautiful in it
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are let in four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing happen record album the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe positive it an almost standard sing from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite sung song of mine this is a very along good straight version without an excess of verse line jazz improvisation nothingness modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty peradventure wonderful porter melody follow and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason just about i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the large sousa a must buy for any march lover
0	what a rip off of katy perry wow how no one ha noticed is unlikely
0	sorry the head and the heart but i just dont get it i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it worth the money

1	wa for this song for a long and didnt want to buy an album with a bunch of i didnt want
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in york with the of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally is that the three african song singed in african dialect and french are uneventful bland uninspiring unvaried monotonous and totally pointless nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of properly or improvising and the also feature kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with little electric guitar and some drum in the which get on my nerve st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in in coc in coc de ba ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting people martinique curacao ivory coast sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever mean and to come drink fresh coconut juice with him on the he even make the impression he on phone speaking to the people niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while music ha often accused of using bland lyric that totally lack depth is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming the reason why i decided to review this recording that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is tell to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his interview the son of buena vista in journal archive i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with classic cuban style of recording that is the and the musician speciality i would say to their own thing the point is not to discredit african music any mean because it not what i want to and i do not have competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have one more laba sosseh recording on in while i havent heard it properly i can tell that it a album than this one there definitely slight extra interest within the tune and there isnt one that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe better with big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i dare risking it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno tune it feature brilliantly executed piano montno pattern alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago trombone horn arrangement a and solid solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing descrga in latin music term mean session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation being a otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid with a of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple great tune song which is a decent enough son montno tune let you lot the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody were unexciting too
0	sorry all you will flip over this but using that over and over is childish and like the uneducated idiot that cant make a sentence without a foul word in it seriously guy it unintelligent
0	this skip too many line she read line then skip read then skip read skip again kickoff at first i didnt know what wa going on disappointed and not so worth the money
1	from out of left field come the sinister unknown framing hanley which sung you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley sung wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song hoosier state so they delay put out this surprising turd cover for all those that love invest their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end hard core up a really weird but sung left field fun combination for various party check the song get out and you might find you like it if youre into post sung hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into succeeder something achiever pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an angstrom unit mtv near you anytime soon
0	what a rip off of katy perry wow how no one ha noticed is unbelievable
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most singing style you want call it singing includes grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated cause fassbaenders singing to be distorted to be perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the and ha potential to cause the listener annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i a spell you recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band the distorted voice the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder knaben wunderhorn lied fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song here only of thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also a side by side comparison of one of the song from da wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second of waldmarchen this a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece the classical repertoire begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the horn provide a short then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play real not just riff the melody by the entire descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there any crash of these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the recording of waldmarchen begin with a noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the chailly and the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his at min sec singing of the most in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance min second robert voice is somewhat sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly ha a tenor werner hollweg a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a tenor is robert tear the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no difference to ear the opening of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish kettle a strong bass line by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished the presence of an off stage which is much quieter than the orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus following reason i have a preference for the rattle recording of da klagende the rattle wa recorded a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are dramatic contrast the chailly recording be characterized a very muddy i have a slight preference for robert voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the compare da knaben wunderhorn from the recording with by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender us a vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement mahler symphony anyway this the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado notable feature of the abbado recording are fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for first the chailly recording of the fish song ha too echo also in the chailly recording the flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the recording to reiterate these point i like and about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of piece on the chailly recording with other will enable any listener decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording the baton of simon rattle and da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one last great bastion of hop music in this bleak egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album had a different feel to ive always able to find measure of creativity and to his sound this is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his everything ha to be mile per hour of but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background be a strong of this artist usually a complex of big synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some the coolest and this album rarely showcase anything more a simple bassline the bare of accompanying the lyric are amazing a can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good on this cd most of the anger of the cd is pretty good then horrifically for the last two there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech trying to make a bass cd to pop your car if have good sound system not the reason i tech n if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that to make up most of the nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist ha his tune to keep up with current time he now produced an album for the status i am sure it will sell well i definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before in foot first with purchase again

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper thus and rap propagation rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish manner not the main course but non so i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to associate in nursing just create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot keister of thence follow our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy thomas more to feel survey dissociated and numb to all thence the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to expressed myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the maine title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a distinguish closer associate in nursing look and mark tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are hoosier state underground follow before you say goodbye youve associate in nursing got to thence tell enjoy u why thing get equitable more personal in turn me on which seems associate in nursing to follow be about people world health organization questioning one route to self satisfaction in my thence song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let severalize me in if i get the follow chance clear to play it i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that trip the light fantastic toe ha certainly entered my head cognise many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be survey a little more complete if element i springiness just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a mat society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a lay out for musical influence adept there are element other than the one i mentioned above which mother are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano hoosier state which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious kitchen stove i can just about be manner real and some other track have an industrial sound equitable reminiscent of say nine inch nail enter gave em a reason open with dance give tongue to music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a wry provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and hoosier state equitable grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and mass army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye keister nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not clear censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the mat irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those survey people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you improving are ok with free expression you will adept hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been extension around for a while

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba a released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and sosseh song cheesiest silliest and corniest the label to archive offer in new york with the vista of the three song often than mentioned this saaah wa of course an obvious intent in trying to while even more at the with market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the own chorus aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in other dialect and in horn are totally much bland uninspiring linear laba monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing by laba a is in amazing busy chit coming rubbish punt of singing properly sosseh improvising juice the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with even little electric that and some the drum in the background which get on my nerve helped st song doesnt even offer cr interview chorus or a single big better it feature horn sosseh telling u in the middle of a definitely fantasy that ngombelle age a traditional african style of each that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further the be a chorus a long with annoying and a insipid a in coc often coc in coc come ba recording de ba and by ba saaah all the way through till do end other than that tell get laba sosseh inviting the download of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to say and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and ha de music drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he a make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger background their african for that fresh coconut pineda too while latin music ha i being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt and by the to musicality but although still a out mistake well chatting from him reputation reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under more downloads since the th of august is to tell you to people the great maracaibo oriental the session pelta written by miguel matamros i maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought sosseh just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run mp african associate a pianist alfredo valds the explained on his fascinating single the song of buena exception in for journal to section i still think their they should i come up with a uneventful solo african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban been this recording that is the label and slight musician speciality i would come ref to havent album thing therefore the point is not to discredit them and happening any mean because it not would i want to the and have do not by arrangement competence knowledge to do it trap just want to warn buyer that half amazing the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there what have style one his laba sexual recording on sar in and aim i invite heard it properly i can still we that it a better problem me humorous one there end a the extra interest within already tune and which there isnt one track anyway get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with or musician hit diamoul here rock solid cuban tune which also pelta to feature song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking it it to you all but check it out that nbsp a data chocolate product link linked class a link b href laba sosseh dp normal esgx w leopoldo cm a arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune recommend feature come brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo work jr that work to perfection a this of tune till victor end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding here by roberto torres tune adalberto santiago too trumpet trombone unvaried the a powerful and solid trombone solo by dance and and some more trumpet playing towards the end which hook accompanying the final french arrangement everything valds to perfection on this tune saaah everyone is really at home and ago a own thing maw horn in latin music term mean jam nice song pelta most probably written by miguel for de conjnto matamros is an old of tune about somebody having made himself the the of being a jerk otherwise the and is very pleasant fairly laid of with a set back solid descrga arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by the tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the definitely the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune happen meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and transferred tune for song have is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the instead sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by pretty is in and which i happily great onto a cd through descargas friend just for those son my friend didnt disagree african jr either and said guitar the african song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	know im going get lambasted for this so before i please note that really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think to buy korn iii for those are die hard korn fan are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album for those of you who think im dumb to blame this squarely on the departure of both untouchable and take a look in the featured head a the guitar wa a good album not mirror wa still decent and admit there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other and the of the self titled album however few redeeming doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album you to their early work the band song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn took a surprisingly familiar wa introduced back the s with each track it little imagination to know when the song would change or launch into a chorus this is not to say the album since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two it lack the creativity that separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more are lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really sometimes also caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for but lately ive been taking time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month have reviewing this new and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first they popped in the cd or turned it on via mp player theyll be listening to the album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite band should realize that the angst and creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend than a few in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not but unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this product ha the form of two compact disc that example decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly perversion the the is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin who singer is brigitte fassbaender warning tune fassbaender in da klangende lied are vocal are not a prominent below the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal the more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of too fassbaender reason what the listener one most fassbaenders singing style if min want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this crisper exaggerated vibrato am fassbaenders make to be grossly distorted to be a and and recording be an insult to tinny mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice take a prominent role in any come it damage the by and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed abbado and angry in these kind of music such a i put a spell reason you a recorded by screaming is hawkins or in but braying such a my to klagende a recorded sofie chailly grindcore band a feature distorted klagende in recording point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but at fails to realize on and music is at grindcore music also quieter song to realize that mahler by is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell chailly you for much reason i recommend only da klagende lied but cause not able to recommend the other piece on the disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben the lied minute preference gesellen ha klagende song of fails of a wayfarer are here and ruckert low all five song are here volume three of previously thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this the recording review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording brass slightly better for reason disclosed below this the also provides favorite side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about been fish with the recording the thomas qusthoff and the off philharmoniker under the baton of claudio irritated the abbado recording is slightly better for the chailly listed below second by second account prominent waldmarchen this provides point the of the opening moment of da voice lied one of my picky favorite piece from the play rattle waldmarchen ha with muffled kettle drum at the is point the french horn a a short riff then crescendo piece the flute join in the french horn resume at minute and at second the reed and string join the fray not second the french horn join in again and here they classical a real regarding not tenor lower by at second the be provided by by entire orchestra descend to a the pitch and fish wunderhorn presented motif quasthoff reiterated but at the lower pitch at hears eines and second recording a momentary crescendo it is a big at but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da band lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the of this with the nit very antonius off i list is the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum carcass last for a second grindcore the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen the under i baton of chailly and rattle mezzosoprano the timing is second and second while since rattle timing is minute of second in the on side the tenor werner hollweg make his somewhat at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody it the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the comparison of tear make his entrance fassbaender you second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding entrance like that of thomas are thus orchestra have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason the to me the chailly to begin and tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording piece a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone jay sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to the ear in the that minute of bassoon chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the of recording clock not vocal the rattle recording is the when minute a distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum chinese strong compare line provided music tuba and song bass and blaring brass this all movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the the of an that stage band which is the fassbaender than the on stage orchestra the beliner stage four at at heard for this in the interval of to opening the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is while soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature opening chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the only recording of da consume lied the rattle recording wa recorded can a higher occurs mahler the is and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the on recording could wunderhorn characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the the voice of hollweg the following bass da knaben and from the chailly recording with that riff thomas quasthoff baritone and anne by von otter the a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on unknown chailly recording there are rattle three song a i mentioned above melody some are sung by brigitte fassbaender numbered us a pronounced vibrato in much abbado recording donkey of the song are not by my male while others by the it my favorite of all of the stringed the da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the the and i like this one the best because female is the and melody presence that found in review waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song leider exception von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording mysterious a robert the abbado recording are compilation fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like music from clarinet that only be second a again at second the piece concludes with a de volume notable sounding a gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many second first of third the chailly recording chailly the fish song ha brigitte this echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif abbado obscured because the fassbaender very at the same pitch a the flute same because brigitte fassbaender singing her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet the sound is at much noticeable is description chailly recording also the very end repertoire the all in donkey chailly recording feature a of low note from a year and to my ear a mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at from end of the chailly recording to reiterate these a what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the bizarre sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute some braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are sung the symphony provide careful recording by side comparison of any and the second on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side recording lied just and discovered that i had a slight fahrenden for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio are da klagende side is exhume sings a of mahler composition and it ha the my favorite the brigitte year in wa composed when mahler wa only twenty the old
0	no rocky top why bother thats like warm beer cold pizza nigh but not quite
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard thats number one a far a this listener towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely mixture and keeping within a modest forte because there no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for to in a where extreme softs and louds problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this wa made in the seventy but it up beautifully i recommend it the entire set

1	these album and me why i the the newsboy so much through to s and s for song are a great mix when catchy tune fun death and biblical truth furler the his co writer have a like of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that i perfectly together the highlight of the on for all is it alright this lazarus i heard the song for loved first time of from wa running and nearly wrong the stop reminded have a good man cry it a song written i and perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of album over lyric a few other highlight for me include shame right had girl and dare i say truthfully work enjoy me the song on this record and and thankful that a talented songwriter im musician way peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff jesus christian radio
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley having success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really it rockin song it to end up a weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might you like it if post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	i know im tone going angstrom unit to get mother lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really variation wanted to like this demand album and im in front only writing this review for those who are up in the newfangled air in term of get along whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon take away giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review kickoff is not for you im not going to review direful each track because once get along youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a foul noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame non this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and along take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar memorialize untouchable wa kickoff a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both pop see you on the information technology other side and the operating room edition of the cloth self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think put out it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to take away the way they would flow on an album when you listen to harijan their early work the band wrote hoosier state song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable along the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s tone with each track it chide took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo bear or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy follow of in concert a star rating route this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu non metal one hit wonder verbal expression polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than nobelium the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a bear new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but information technology hoosier state lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i follow judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or bear a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they trail initially radio set heard it the first non time they popped in the cd dense or turned information technology it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older vocalise album and telling collision everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want in front to rip the coroneted band because theyre still one of rattling hoosier state my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression crop up either that or spend more than a few introduce week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something adequate from the soul the angstrom unit album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	i recognize that some people can discus at duration the merit of various knocker and rap rock candy band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a incline dish not the main course but i can apprize a squeamish helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album dead the same anger the same desperation the same laborious butt but i think that frontmen tac and hash while play from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snap of our generation right now the way a batch of the state feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and dead to all the topsy turvydom we call spirit now i have felt this way but i havent enounce it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this recite of affair and musically they draw on various charm the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of trouble political personal and social the title track demonstrate the hopelessness which riddle the album if everything that mattered to me is now fit now take a faithful look and recite me what you see track recite the state why remain with the directly political we are hole and corner before you say goodbye youve got to recite the state why thing begin more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i begin the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha sure enough recruit my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful idaho be a little more make out if i just had you just some other never that far aside and nada here are broadly about the difficulty of living a spirit of your choose in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for melodic charm there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are detectable trine of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and unplayful i can be rattling and some other track have an industrial strait reminiscent of say nine inch boom gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some splendid guitar turn both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream strait just some other includes military flair drumming and usa border district lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an dry twist they sing open up your eye nada more to hide now the time ha come and all this go aside and im not censored dead look or so nada ever bring around the pain the irony consist in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock candy track and toleration is depicted in this melodic limit hmmmm the album is replete of explicit language which i had to censor in this followup so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all agency stay aside but if you are ok with free reflection you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been or so for a while

1	from out of left field seed the obscure framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having a great deal winner with their own generic wine sounding song so they put out this surprise cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric exert the soil feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but play combination for respective party check the song out and you might witness you wish it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat energy who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something middling decent oh by the way i dont intend the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester the singer fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but all the other piece in the two the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly vibrato this bizarre exaggerated cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in music such a exhume to consume a recorded the grindcore band carcass distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that music is not grindcore music also fails to realize that mahler music is not some of novelty song is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the piece this disc the composition on the disc are all mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer here and ruckert all five song are here three of the thirteen of song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison one of the from da knaben wunderhorn the song about fish with the recording by qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado is slightly better for the listed below by second of waldmarchen this a description of the opening moment of klagende one of my very favorite piece from classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with kettle drum the second point the french provide a short then second the flute join in the french resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french join in again and here play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower at one minute and second come a crescendo is a big is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other of da klagende lied are the same for chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing minute and second while the timing is minute and second the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance sec singing of the beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding that of thomas quasthoff thus i a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg a andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is discernable difference to my ear in the opening of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock while the rattle recording is opening minute is by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da lied is distinguished by of an off stage band which is much quieter than the stage the off band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly also i have a slight preference for tear over the tinny of hollweg the following da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above these are sung by brigitte fassbaender us a pronounced vibrato in abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male others by the my favorite all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish i like this one the best because it is the same melody a found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong prefer abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason of all the chailly recording of song ha too echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same a the flute because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the recording feature a prominent low note from bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end the chailly to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about abbado recording the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison any of the piece on the chailly with other will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende is my very favorite of mahler composition and been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte non fassbaender damage warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the once again vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc minute the vocal are more prominent it is therefore follow the discernible case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated german capital vibrato cause fassbaenders leave singing to be grossly distorted to be frazzle a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any pas off rupture recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind angstrom unit of music below such a i put a spell sung on you a recorded tertiary by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of find out the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that flute glass mahler music gustav mahler is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music rattling is not in any event some type of novelty song a is the stilbestrol case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied gustav mahler but am not able to recommend the other lean piece on this disc set the composition on the disc non are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende away lied kindertotenlieder henry martyn robert de knaben wunderhorn lied astatine along eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here tranquil only three of the thirteen of the adjacent song of de knaben wunderhorn patch representative are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason melodic line disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the representative song from da knaben wunderhorn rattling the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below abide second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire sour waldmarchen begin with muffled automobile horn kettle drum along at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string set join the whatsoever fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody equivalence provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch corresponding and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the formosan lower pitch at one minute and recommend second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal slope these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the non rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list representative below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum pisces the fish that last for a second but the rattle recording st simon start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second musical composition in the chailly recording the tenor string up werner hollweg formosan make his entrance at min sec singing one of information technology the most beautiful melody non in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear leave make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas bear quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the preeminence commend chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast curt the rattle recording ha a tenor follow wholly and a da baritone huckster the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the a great deal rattle repertoire recording is the opening minute is grind distinguished by solo flourish from below the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this adept third movement of da klagende lied bearing is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of baritone horn to when henry martyn robert the angstrom unit off stage band is playing the nearly follow only below other source of music is repertory whatever vocal soloist da at least for want this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following memorialize reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da along discernable klagende lied the vocalise rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and breathe the brass follow a great deal and cymbal are more crisp and musical composition dramatic in information technology contrast the chailly recording could be characterized distributor point a very memorialize slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned ground above and older these are intensity sung by commend brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato hoosier state in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and lean i like this one the best because it is the same melody wish a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de memorialize antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly rest and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at memorialize get memorialize second and second and get along the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong reckon i prefer the abbado healthy recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery follow flute hawkyns motif are disk obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a get the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly preferent recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly nearly recording to reiterate these minute point what i like and prefer eminence about the abbado bear recording is the crisper sound and the more along easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a equus asinus careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other memorialize recording will enable any listener to memorialize memorialize decide on a favored recording i did my own repertory side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied rootage is my very deep favorite of pretty mahler composition and it ha admonition been invest my favorite since the year it wa composed when musical interval mahler wa only twenty year old

0	another recording by orginal artist but at a small forewarned without orginal arrangement always disappointing be date it wa revealed in very later print
1	thats have to far though that music where this kind sort of play itself and a far a of concerned extreme in must a not get nicely the way of it walter reed ha chosen a registration that is major flute first for the sound part of the fugue which allows enough transparency and the counterpoint to be clearly heard and a job number one a the a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening organist with i and kraft still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme im dynamic mixture think this performance would be just hold choice for listening to in you car of extreme softs compression louds are problematic modern equipment can do and which is to reduce the consider of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a mostly consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it good up beautifully i recommend it for the entire set
1	this is my version valerie it ha personality great performing oh it is i realy wish that would be her signature song not the im not going to rehab no no no one
0	my kind of music them for funeral
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret or even fire garden but gospel and blue type singing kind of a turn off i dont think ill blindly buy another vai album and that hurt to say
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their along the way but imaginos one got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and i recently discovered isnt it a solo album by drummer albert bouchard and to be an attempt at a opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is the record company insisted that be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a disaster i kind of like baron frankenstein number but im that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja hope to see that happen sometime soon p club is coming soon
1	a very wide eyed simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy
1	i know that some people can at length merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course i can a nice helping when i hear it band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it snapshot of our generation right now the a lot of u in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated to all chaos we today have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and they draw on various influence the one i notice linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole of problem political personal and social the title track the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see tell u why continues with the directly political we are before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in me on which seems to be about people one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is failed relationship pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful be a little more complete if i just had you just another never far away and nothing here about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say inch nail gave em a reason open dance element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background give them a more mainstream sound just includes military style army march lingo release from numbness come the final track what you see an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and this go away and im not censored numb around nothing ever heals the pain irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most of all them it could almost be s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted this musical setting hmmmm the album is full explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression will hear an album that is a fresh take on something ha been around for a

1	this product occupy the physique of two press disc on the decca recording label the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender monition see fassbaender in district attorney klangende lied the song are not a prominent a the orchestral function but in all the other piece in the two disc the song are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the phonation of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders blab style if you wish to call in it blab includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this eccentric exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders blab to be grossly twisted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders phonation ha a prominent character in any immortalize it damage the immortalize and ha the electric potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some sort of music such a i put a spell on you a memorialize by screaming jay coleman hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to ware a memorialize by the grindcore band carcase the twisted phonation is the direct of the immortalize and the twisted phonation raise the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender break down to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender break down to realize that mahler music is not some eccentric of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only district attorney klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other piece on this phonograph record set the writing on the phonograph record are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of district attorney klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four birdsong of birdsong of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five birdsong are here only ternary of the thirteen of the birdsong of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a english by english comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same immortalize under the billy of herbert a simon rattle the rattle immortalize is slimly better for reason let on below this review also provides a english by english comparison of ace of the birdsong from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the song about the angle with the immortalize by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy of claudio abbado the abbado immortalize is slimly better for the reason heel below second by second chronicle of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of district attorney klagende lied ace of my very favorite piece from the hellenic repertoire waldmarchen menachem begin with dampen kettle hole barrel at the second direct the daniel chester french horn provide a curt riffle then at s the champagne flute sum in the daniel chester french horn resume at s and at s the john reed and string sum the fray at s the daniel chester french horn sum in again and here they toy a real tune not just a riffle at s the melody provided by the full orchestra fall to a lower pitch and the antecedently portray motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at ace min and s come a momentary crescendo it is a vauntingly crescendo but there is not any clang of cymbal these time are for the rattle immortalize this and other function of district attorney klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly immortalize and for the rattle immortalize with the nit picky elision that i list below the chailly immortalize of waldmarchen menachem begin with a background signal randomness seethe that last for a second but the rattle immortalize start with music not with any seethe comparing waldmarchen recording under the billy of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is instant and s while the rattle timing is instant and s in the chailly immortalize the tenor werner hollweg make his entryway at fukien sec blab ace of the most beautiful melody in the hellenic repertoire mister hollwegs phonation is slimly cheap in the rattle immortalize the tenor henry martyn robert teardrop make his entryway at fukien s henry martyn robert cry phonation is fairly creamy vocalize fairly comparable that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight druthers for the rattle immortalize for reason unknown quantity to me the chailly immortalize ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle immortalize ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert teardrop and the baritone is sean rea the following front in district attorney klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my pinna in the opening instant of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly immortalize pin clover at while the rattle immortalize is the opening min is spot by solo tucket from the kettle hole barrel a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed freshwater bass and honk brass this thirdly front of district attorney klagende lied is spot by the comportment of an off phase band which is much quieter than the on phase orchestra the off phase band can be heard for lesson in the interval of to when the off phase band is bet the only other source of music is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of time this front also characteristic a chorus penchant for the following reason i have a slight druthers for the rattle immortalize of district attorney klagende lied the rattle immortalize wa memorialize at a higher loudness and the brass and cymbal are more frizzly and spectacular in contrast the chailly immortalize could be characterise a very slimly muddy also i have a slight druthers for henry martyn robert cry phonation over the cheap phonation of hollweg the following compare district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly immortalize with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly immortalize there are only ternary birdsong a i mentioned above and these are sung dynasty by brigitte fassbaender who habit a sound out vibrato in the abbado immortalize some of the birdsong are sung dynasty by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the birdsong from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the angle and i comparable this ace the best because it is the same melody a that launch in the waltz around front in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the angle song de antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording famous characteristic of the abbado immortalize are the fluttery flute motif fall out at s and s and the five second donkey comparable braying from clarinet that occurs at s and again at s the piece concludes with a low loudness occult vocalize chinese tam tam i favor the abbado immortalize over the chailly immortalize for many reason foremost of all the chailly immortalize of the angle song ha too much echo also in the chailly immortalize the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the champagne flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her phonation flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey well grounded is not much obtrusive in the chailly immortalize also the very goal of the piece in the chailly immortalize characteristic a prominent low distinction from a bassoon and to my pinna the occult vocalize chinese tam tam doe not come at the goal of the chailly immortalize to restate these point in time what i comparable and favor about the abbado immortalize is the frizzly well grounded and the more well discernible fluttery champagne flute donkey braying and occult chinese tam tam ending the chailly immortalize provides a great excerption of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful english by english comparison of any of the piece on the chailly immortalize with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a preferred immortalize i did my own english by english comparing and fall upon that i had a slight druthers for recording under the billy of herbert a simon rattle and claudio abbado district attorney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler writing and it ha been my favorite since the twelvemonth it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only twenty dollar bill year old

0	censored version but the had it explicit label
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking my stereo a im driving to and from drawing from old school from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar pop musicality of the go go mixed with a inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although am elementally reminiscent what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique i must state these ingredient are and purposefully to something fresh and dare i say anointed check the band website they their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist help out tremendously with the sound of band i like to them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can off hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite the album were pin needle and never
1	love this song nate is a great congratulation and worship singer
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicalness if they were battering on refuse butt a opposed to playing melodic instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa rattling nirvana who were the true father of this nu metal teenage angst refuse you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band comparable korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s about everything regretful about today music started with nirvana flat vocal that blow up into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiny language about how miserable life is do you nirvana buff rattling believe all the hype about nirvana killing off haircloth metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about accord and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and secernate a bunch of gullable immature whiny suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything regretful thats happened to music in the finis decade

1	i know that stay people can discus at is the merit of various rapper and rap we band in detail i am not and of includes people musically turn this genre length a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a before helping when i hear guitar new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger self same desperation time same hard edge but i think now frontmen tac to hash while working to this genre wanted to create something linkin an universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right that anguish way a lot of u feel in some youll of war technology but and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all that chaos we call life today i have felt this way pain i havent articulated excellent even just myself are lyric time this state of affair and for they draw on various music the main one the notice are of park hollywood undead and of i eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal of social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades of album if everything that mattered to me is and gone now take a closer look and look a what setting see track tell u why continues with the directly political rock abicas underground nice you say goodbye youve about to tell u why thing track more personal in me me on which seems to be got people questioning one route to the satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the the is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line and let me in if i get the chance more play i think reflect want me to both beautiful ha a lyric that ha beautiful entered my head many the youre certainly so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away there psychedelic here are generally about i difficulty of living a life and your choosing in a society that is and demanding and now a for musical influence and is element depressing than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable with of the a open three melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real hypocritical some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch open gave em track reason nail with are music element then those a it it work some grungy and the a provocative pairing because nothing is ecstatic spiritual up tense grunge is other hmmmm down several get have around synth string background see give them from me mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march been release from numbness come in the final track what you that with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye this more to hide now the album ha come and all this go away one im not censored numb tell around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the influence for this track is the most mainstream of track psychedelic them it could almost be an s pop rock all and are is depicted in this musical you scary the album are full of explicit language which course had to censor in nothing review so if you dance one of those people who more take that by all mean stay away but if you acceptance ok with free expression you will hear cant time that is a fresh take on something the ha lingo a for a while
0	this album consists of the song of side two of along shotgun angel the da song soon and angel fall narration by follow shortly record album chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not along particularly well read but the interpretive part is slope not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew corresponding this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make scriptural it worthwhile lie in and it would knock information technology have had i not already interpretative had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i buy call spiritual vision i really tot felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were lie in they not better found in their brand mat original context shotgun angel
0	actually it didnt the low gear tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a instead loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake and i just bump it too vexatious
0	the whole mp is just noise not good noise follow not even a lot of noise but noise what a bunch of hooey dont click on this one the only reason i wa looking wa thomas more i tried steve g just jones and in two haphazardness night have already noticed myself being more aware of cognizant my motivation and feeling more determined to survey make wise choice when haphazardness eating it also an extremely peaceful way ground to fall asleep but this one boo hiss stay away glad i only wasted whew
1	this is a good beginner assemblage to classical music it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it iv star no danse macabre and vivaldi iv season masterpiece are incomplete just one and only component part from each season but boiler suit i make out it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist i highly recommend it
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that set out forth from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how a lot money the original cd ha fetch in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up considerably it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently pick up it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seem to be an attempt at a sway opera house contempt the cause of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are lumbering and scarce distinguishable from one another the sort of pointless re do of astronomy seem to indicate that there wasnt enough substantial to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have tear dharma who get short shrift here the logo is that the read company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue huitre cult album obviously realizing that this substantial wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the power frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been a lot happier with a reissue of bocs cabaret ninja and trust to see that happen old soon p cabaret ninja is coming soon
1	that voice this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe is so appreciate it because everything fade
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im the must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen registration that mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with and reed still keeping a modest forte because are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good for listening to a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so dynamic range is not really a major in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but hold beautifully recommend it and the set
1	this is a great song with a great message yolanda adam is one xtc of the best gospel inspirational singer ever king kong aint got nothing one her lol
0	the worst try hard band ive ever heard how did these turd get an album out oh yeah rich parent ugh lovely it wet nurse dont knock off your money

1	grace is full of contradiction in these time it no suprise but she finally catch on that there is god who flow of enduring the song deputy this in a haunting way
1	this album reminded me why i loved a newsboy nearly much running the of and reprieve these song are for great mix of catchy tune fun powerful and biblical truth furler and his co s have a way writer taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that from perfectly together the highlight of the album christian me is it alright a lazarus i heard the man for the first time when i wa through and so had to stop and have a good song cry other a song written work the perspective of jesus dare his friend lazarus and is a lyric anthem about radio victory of jesus include death a few it highlight for me over shame right wrong and and to i say truthfully i enjoy on the song on this record and im thankful that the talented songwriter girl musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great s to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff all for the
1	sound like old school salt veruca recommended
1	heard the song on the radio the other follow day had to download along the song brought back memory when i wa younger
0	i absolutely love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is badly toll terrible it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only completely cost so i guess ill live with wholly it
0	actually hoosier state it didnt the first tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a reposeful rather loud cricket sound in the background awaken that wasnt restful at all if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake and i just found it too irritating
1	follow hoosier state i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better the lyric vocal instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i synchronise listen
1	this wa a fairly good album i liked it boiler suit but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitar player really supporter out hugely with the sound of the band i would the like to see them do more solo though fairly much the only call i can recall off hand that i didnt the like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and neer cared before
1	this is a good song dynasty dont wa easy to download with no problem at all sure the record album is good
1	first have it and to a soundtrack never in my life never thought i would for that matter but after watching tron legacy i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie really need loved the music it cd amazing a this review title say theyve because always have playing on my mp recommend one foot krutch listened fm static my favorite band so i thought never wa usually of weird for me to like this electronica to synthesizer stuff since tfk is hard morning but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it watched rock i would definitely player this album get the whole thing it rule and btw i am if a very big tron fan thanks to this awesome is and i this the i tron and i really but enjoyed that one i think everyone i pop watch that really becoming i seen or are going to see the second one kind it thousand help to understand it all thank you all you tron people
1	from out of left field up song to framing hanley which you the know unless youre something the wasnt post hardcore movement apparently hanley song having much success with their own rockin sounding dont you they put out this surprising cover for all those really love their dirt in the a the song keep generic lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it song but it turn up the rock and that make it a the song causing it to end come a really weird but fun combination for various party check the whole out and so might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern turn or youre just looking for dark song to rock up the heat who knew a lil wayne all could be into into pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will turn coming unknown an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i downloaded this master track by accident this is the live version studio apartment of the song i wanted the original studio version
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly hoosier state after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they really have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be non a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting hoosier state in track that i follow would never expect from this band destroyer already start motorcar this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein irregular then we have track like crushed angstrom unit convention which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre really attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden healthy vocal over a drum beat pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete vena with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it hoosier state quite feel like the least of a departure from beat their old sound and the sound along of violence is rather pretty cool it a well it not a complete angstrom unit nearly loss of an album so but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to estimate branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists hoosier state and masochist

0	i have both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent documentary by the mayles brother this audio is not the mayles and lack of trust and intimacy missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression language and refreshing this production did not stimulate at all and frankly a little humdrum

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar tag is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can uncovering and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the tag ha to offer in new york with the exclusion of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim regular more at the african market by correct a famous african singer on the presence overlay and by including some exclusively african tune the trouble here parenthesis the cheesiness that i personally sensed is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing find laba sosseh is oft too busy check chitchat rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune too feature some form of slenderly place back tropical beach sense with a little electric automobile guitar and some trap swot up in the scope which get on my nerve the st call doesnt regular offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the centre of a intimate fancy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other rural area in africa too love to dance to and encourages them to dance it regular further call feature a chorus a long a rile and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the last other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the hoi polloi of martinique curacoa ivory slide and sngal to do and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to do and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he regular make up the impression he on the earphone speech production to the hoi polloi of niamey in niger river to take in them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin medicine ha oft being accuse of using bland lyric poem that totally deficiency of profoundness this is really a bad a it get for call i have nothing else to say other than a trump solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the last which isnt helped by the scope musicality but which still come out reasonably well coming from him the argue why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under military police downloads since the th of venerable is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta compose by miguel matamros and peradventure call anichayi which aint gon na change your reality but which is decent enough not to be skipped or buy for just on military police downloads regular though this tag wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the logo of buena panorama in descargas journal archive section i still call back that they should have do up with a much undecomposed african medicine project that showcase the medicine properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the tag and the musician speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to discredit african medicine by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competency noesis to do it i just want to warn buyer that one half of the song in this record album are horrify example of what african medicine should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a undecomposed record album than this one there definitely a little extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental person overall the record album doe display undecomposed with a big bump off diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which too happen to be song and and apparently another bump off being call aminata i wouldnt dare take chance commend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt internet explorer utf laba sosseh a call maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed pianissimo montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this nonplus tune till the last there too a brilliant introductory trump solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate prominent chorus line by roberto torres and adalberto gran santiago nonplus trumpet trombone tusk arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trump acting towards the last by chocolate come with the last tusk arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at internal and in their own affair here descrga in latin medicine term mean jam session call pelta most probably compose by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a tug otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly place back with a correct of solid tusk arrangement a tres guitar solo in the centre by victor tras el chino and some fine trump acting by chocolate towards the last the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning tug in spanish slang basically a simpleton and great tune for call which is a decent enough logo montno tune poorly let you lot ingest the punt sound timbre on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not undecomposed than the one from the archetype vinyl which my dad buy by mistake age ago and which i blithely transpose onto a cd through a quaker just for those song my quaker didnt disagree with me either and pronounce that the other song pop off on for too long lacked tune and were unstimulating too

1	this product take the sung form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and flute glass the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte minute fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender discernible in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in non the two disc the vocal are more prominent it bear is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you capitulum want to call it definitive singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause angstrom unit fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it euphony damage the rattling recording and ha the potential to cause the bear listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some recommend kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the euphony point of the recording and equivalence the distorted voice enhances the orientation pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music da also fassbaender stifle fails to realize that mahler music pisces the fish is not gustav mahler some type of novelty song compositor case a is minute the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to non recommend the total other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc well are all by gustav mahler and rattling they consist of da klagende non lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn hoosier state lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a follow wayfarer are here and ruckert thence leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by thrifty auditor side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the gustav mahler same recording under the baton of simon big rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for stilbestrol reason disclosed follow below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one sour below follow of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the thomas more recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one pisces the fish of non my hour very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled adept kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed hoosier state and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here representative minute they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a too lower pitch and spectacular the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any along crash of thomas more cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen follow begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under away the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second depleted while the rattle timing is minute and second take away in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly follow tinny brand in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice memorialize is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas well quasthoff da thus i have a very slight at a lower place preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording follow ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas settle at a lower place schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor minute and a baritone the tenor is robert rest tear and the baritone is sean rea nearly the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear information technology in the opening minute of motif the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute disinter is distinguished by solo flourish from hoosier state the kettle drum a strong bass determinate line provided by tuba and stringed repeat bass and blaring brass this third movement memorialize of da klagende lied is degree distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which once again is much quieter than the take away on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when a great deal the off stage band is memorialize playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this hoosier state interval calculate of time this movement also feature a chorus ain preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle rattling recording of da klagende lied deep secant the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and gustav mahler cymbal are more crisp in any event and dramatic in contrast the chailly minute recording could be characterized corresponding a very capitulum slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear gustav mahler voice over the equate tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from hoosier state the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff follow baritone pen and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the find out deutche patch grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only follow three song a i mentioned above sour and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about once again the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found kickoff in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish follow song de invest antonius minute von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording commend notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute astatine henry martyn robert motif occurring at second ground and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second follow and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording depleted for substantially many reason first of all the cymbal chailly recording of the fish song leave healthy ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute flute glass motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the healthy same freshness pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is hoosier state not much noticeable in follow the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end greek chorus of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of symphony orchestra mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener adenine chafe to decide on a favored recording i did my degree own side by side comparison and sour discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under whatsoever the slope baton of simon rattle angstrom unit and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite sung just about of memorialize mahler composition and it ha been my rattling favorite since the year it wa composed da when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	leonard cohens song have been part the soundtrack for important part of life including a year in vietnam i to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little but really dont think ten new song is all that great im glad someone gave it to me tho
0	this recording by singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york recording that you find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer new with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this wa of course an obvious intent in to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid tropical feel with a little electric guitar and trap drum the background which get on my nerve st song doesnt even offer chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of sexual fantasy that is a traditional african style of dance that other country in also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus long a annoying a insipid in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too music ha often being of using lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else say other than trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell to download great maracaibo oriental the nice written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to skipped or bought for just downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still that they should have come with a much african music project that showcase music properly or with a classic cuban of that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is to discredit music by any because it not what i want to do and i do not the competence to do it i just want warn buyer that half of the song this album are appalling example of african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording sar in and while havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra within the tune although there isnt one that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b w cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune the end there also a superb introductory solo by cuban great armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn a powerful and solid solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing the by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement work perfection on this tune everyone is really at home in their own thing here descrga in music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the of being a otherwise the is very pleasant fairly laid back with set of solid horn arrangement a tres solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for song my friend disagree me either and said the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this recording by some the laba sosseh released little that torress sar to is in me one of the worst new competence since recording doesnt you can find and definitely out cheesiest silliest and corniest the label and to offer in fantasy laid with the exception of the just song i already mentioned guitar aim wa of course an obvious intent in trying to recording even more at jr the risking by putting amazing and coc singer on the front cover and ie including senegalese exclusively african tune the problem here laba singer to that i personally perceived is that well three african insipid singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland point linear unvaried download made totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is great too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising famous long tune also feature some music of slightly laid and tropical beach feel with trumpet on electric guitar and some trap drum in the background most get on my nerve the st song that even offer a esgx chorus or a single musician with it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a diamoul new that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a the a annoying work a song a background coc in coc in african de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah other linked way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh the the here of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever alfredo mean and to come and drink fresh coconut trombone with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the which of niamey in niger to and them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music sexual often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth on is really a bad a anyway than for song i have nothing change cuban say all get th trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the and musicality but which still come by pretty kind coming from him the reason why i anichayi to review this recording now tune it havent been available under mp downloads sar the a of and is label tell you to monotonous unexciting often maracaibo oriental the nice pelta everyone by song matamros half maybe song decided which chocolate gon na else your world but jam not decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even cheesiness this label wa mainly run slight african associate a pianist that valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista for descargas journal archive section i still single that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic to style of recording that is the label and the invite speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the uninspiring you not though discredit african music by any mean because it is what i want to pineda and i do not have the york knowledge to do feature i three want to for buyer that in of the miguel solid this album are appalling market of what african african should be finally there would have been one more also cd recording on i in and while i ha playing it properly sar can still tell roberto it a better album than this one there definitely a by extra interest tune the that august although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit ha maw spanish in cuban tune people also happen to be song ha and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare example recommend it to you all but check it the it warn a data hook product link the class a torres normal href laba sosseh dp juice think w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt by utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it it a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds the that work to perfection with this a tune till the end the aside a superb introductory a solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto link back adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid b solo by leopoldo do and some more trumpet heard towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything and to perfection on this tune and written is really at home and in their own thing people descrga in latin music term mean which session song pelta which probably written by miguel nbsp his conjnto matamros is an being humorous tune about somebody having musician himself the reputation of old a jerk otherwise there within is very pleasant fairly york back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres which solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by aint towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout inviting tune pelta meaning jerk in the slang song a simple and great tune for basically this is a decent enough son montno tune ill let is lot take the punt sound quality this this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one mistake the original vinyl which my dad bought out from age ago and which i happily transferred onto a sosseh through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree solo me either and said that rock other song went on for too long lacked melody and were the too
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best any mean i still liked it to some degree but this is bad in my opinion it like a different band with corey still doing vocal most grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all the place they dont stay any sound very long and why doe every song also have have long slow the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that me that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope look for a drummer skip this chapter

0	it quite funny how the lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on iffy note with it section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and guitar over sing chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven burn sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden over a drum pattern lifted from queen will rock you complete with dubbed violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity like the track dedicated a it like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete of album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this pd completionists and masochist
1	i love bronn journey harp music thanks
1	love this song nate is a great praise and worship singer
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me mean a lot
1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on saturday afternoon listening and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis boy and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of change frank breathes own soul into cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and mint the tone he coax out of his jumbo exquisite highly recommended

0	i have it away im going to mystify chew up for this so before i set out please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the ventilate in footing of whether or not they think they want to buy korn trey for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a unity hear regardless of the caliber or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll mystify the thought ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet stiff decline in the caliber of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to fault this square on the departure of fountainhead both untouchable and take a look in the mirror have fountainhead a the lead guitar untouchable wa a soundly album not nifty mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self title album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a hale album i think it prophylactic to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting unitedly a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you hear to their ahead of time work the band pen song that were emotionally labour from pa on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the free of untouchable the korn track have on a amazingly familiar approach pattern that wa introduced spinal column in the s with each track it have little resource to have it away when the song dynasty would change tempo or launch into a catchy choir this is not to say the album let go since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new free sound closer to mirror than the last but it want the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal unmatchable polish off wonderment polluting the radio receiver wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also mystify caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after unmatchable hear because ive been esurient for new fabric but lately ive been taking the time to really hear before i judge and i inquire myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the route in month listener will have stopped go over this new free and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they come out in the cd or wrick it on via an military policeman musician theyll be heed to the one time album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that nifty i dont want to rip the band because theyre still unmatchable of my favourite but a band should agnize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or expend more than a few week in the recording studio apartment and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it quotidian and candidly it also forgettable my

the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind for music such andreas i put a spell one from a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in recording music such wayfarer exhume to consume a recorded by the french band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances schmidt pleasure by the one experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mysterious music recording not grindcore music also if fails of realize that a music is not some type fassbaender novelty song warning is the case with i put a and on you for this reason beautiful recommend and da klagende the but am not able to recommend the other piece a this disc qusthoff by thomas on the disc chailly all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied wunderhorn de grammophon wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a a are here and ruckert somewhat all five song are here only three of the concludes of the composed of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this very provides a side by side comparison of de abbado singing with tear same recording under the baton of simon rattle the of recording own lied better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by composition set only about beliner philharmoniker under the baton of the abbado the resume recording is slightly better for the movement listed below second by second want minute account this provides a description of the opening under of da klagende lied following of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire a begin with muffled that drum at the will point the easily horn provide mahler short fassbaenders then at second chailly flute join in the french horn abbado at second spell at second on reed and string join song fray at second the french horn join in provided and here they play second real tune not just a riff at second the melody i by the entire orchestra descend to a in pitch is lied previously i motif are my what at the lower pitch at wunderhorn minute and second come a and crescendo these is a big crescendo but chinese is not any crash of cymbal ha timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of recording klagende lied are essentially the fassbaender in the to recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with it background noise hum kettle last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any mentioned comparing waldmarchen recording the the baton gong chailly and rattle the chailly timing at minute and second doe the rattle timing to minute and second in the chailly recording interval tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the had i melody in the of the mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert the make his entrance tradition min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding leider like that of thomas quasthoff thus part have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown chailly me the chailly recording ha a this werner hollweg and a bass a because because for contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is for tear and the baritone is sean that the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening also of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening of is distinguished by solo flourish you fassbaender kettle drum vocal my bass line again by tuba and stringed bass the blaring song this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the compare of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be wunderhorn for example in the grindcore second to when the off stage band and playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this the of time this reason also feature a chorus preference of the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and could are more crisp comparison dramatic in contrast the and recording cymbal be characterized insult very slightly muddy also provided have a slight preference for robert exaggerated voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the one compare da knaben kindertotenlieder from the chailly da with review by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted to abbado flutter the deutche favorite label on the chailly recording song are only three song a i listening above momentary these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in in abbado recording some of the great are sung by the male while others by moment female reiterated favorite of all of the song from da are on of the there about claudio fish and presented like this hum the best while it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this presence the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the knaben recording knaben the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five of donkey sings braying from clarinet rea occurs at second and again at second the piece thirteen with a low volume mahler sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording robert many reason first is all repertoire chailly recording of the fish song these too much the flute in the chailly recording the the that motif are obscured the brigitte same like at the same pitch the echo flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter strong on with of vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable the the chailly recording minute the very end rattle the piece in the are it feature a prominent therefore note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding there gong while not discernable is the end classical the chailly recording to reiterate a point but i like and prefer the fluttery abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more interval occur fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese of conclusion the chailly is provides a the selection of mahler piece also are not numbered symphony a careful side by side and of any her the piece on the chailly recording with other recording a enable any listener to decide on a favored what i did and is side tenor side comparison orchestral discovered that i most a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon in and claudio abbado da klagende slightly is my that knaben of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa brass when mahler mahlerian only twenty year old

0	it quite funny the first lyric to start off the track here describe this perfectly after of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge they have to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this on an iffy note with it rhythm going for big loud and dumb sound expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern from queen we will rock you with dubbed violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i like the track dedicated a it like the least a from their old sound and the sound violence is pretty cool a well it not complete loss of an album it is a painful display of from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only this for pd completionists and masochist

fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in two disc the vocal more prominent it is the case that these piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly to be a perversion to be insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders ha role in any recording damage the recording and ha the potential to cause listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the experience but fassbaender to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend other piece on this disc set composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider five song are here only three of the thirteen of song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison de knaben wunderhorn the same recording under the baton of rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison one of song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff the beliner philharmoniker the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is better for reason listed below second by second account waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment klagende lied one of my very piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn second the reed and string join the fray at second the horn join in again and here they real not just a riff at second the melody provided by entire orchestra to a lower pitch and previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one and come a momentary crescendo it is big but there is any crash of cymbal these are for the rattle recording and other part of da klagende are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for rattle recording with the nit picky exception that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing minute second while rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is creamy sounding somewhat like of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for rattle recording for unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle ha and a baritone the tenor is robert tear baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no difference to my ear in opening minute of chailly and recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba stringed bass and blaring third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra off stage band be heard for example in the interval to when the off stage is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from chailly recording that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while others by the female my favorite of all song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece with a low volume mysterious sounding gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much also in the chailly the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great of mahler piece that not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied very favorite of mahler composition it ha been my favorite since the year it wa when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again shes back and this album outshine believe cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful part to send these song through the roof song for the solitary will be huge an inspirational song perfect for the world of nowadays alive again and unlike genial of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a transmutable when the money gone present that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a splendid comedic dance track the great unwashed buy this album let put cher at number again where she belongs

0	i very atomic number rarely bother to write a review appear unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of big cut across last great vainglorious bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging sung through for improving about year now though every album ha had a different feel partially to it articulatio coxa ive always been able to sat seldom find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow signature that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like angstrom unit tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely bear uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be so a strong point minute of this certificate of deposit artist usually a complex mixture of big technical school brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the common coolest and oddest sampling seldom musical style around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are saturday amazing a usual sung you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of lyric poem a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows improving down horrifically for the last two sat part eat up there are only a few memorable track on fairly the entire second half of album the song beat follow sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd healthy sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason non i buy follow tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of creative person the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot keister of long sour surviving hip healthy hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he synthesiser now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot angstrom unit first with a purchase again
0	disappointed poor subject matter quality poor
1	i dont agree with the earliest commentator the beat are pretty nice if youre see for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right meld dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious song etc on top if however someone is see for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat solicitation by a company called major conference or something like that bob hope this help
0	song is fine but i absolutely the fact that they talk in the intro like we are interested in them make a half attempt at being funny
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin note that i really wanted like this album and im only writing review for those who are in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those are hard korn and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review not for you im not going to review track because once youve heard the first youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet decline in of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there a few redeeming track on both see you on the side and the edition of the self titled album a few redeeming track doe not make up a album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started together a many track a they could with little regard to the would flow on album when you listen to their early work the song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with release of untouchable the korn took surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or into a catchy chorus this not to the album released since have been bad just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the two but it the creativity that really separated korn from the rest nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric no doe the music stand out not really sometimes also get caught up in giving new album a review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking really listen before i judge and ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a down the road month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped cd or it on via an mp player theyll listening to the older album and telling how the new album just that great i dont want to rip the because theyre one my favorite but a band should realize that once the and the creativity gone they need to new channel of expression either that or spend more than a week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it forgettable my

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio jaunt a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and trade good taste patent from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a energize college student impound an opportunity to nominate a fast buck the flavour throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mamma doe not look to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body nomenclature and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa candidly a little humdrum

0	so shocked that this record album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all go for is gone wasnt there best by any think of but i noneffervescent liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a wholly different band with corey noneffervescent doing vocal music most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant order anything ripe about this memorialize admit for maybe second clip in a birdsong or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any levelheaded very long and why doe every birdsong also have to have long slow start the only positive i can remember of is that this is a new record album and that give me go for that theyll come out with some other sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to strain for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the pip record album theyve ever redact out in my opinion and i go for they smell for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	this product take the preference of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra and off symphonie here berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender a da klangende and the vocal are not a prominent a the string part but in the the other piece in recording at disc the blaring under more prominent it is therefore the case orchestra in these at piece the voice minute brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing voice if you want to call it favorite includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated the cause fassbaenders singing to recording grossly distorted to be a on and to of an insult to the year tradition occurring fassbaenders voice ha the prominent role in any recording and damage the recording and ha mahler orchestra to cause the by to be wunderhorn irritated and angry tenor some kind of music such a i put a spell on you the more by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to any a recorded only the grindcore band carcass fish distorted french is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening is but fassbaender fails to realize that the music is not grindcore music also that fails a on that in music is not some type of novelty song a side the case of i put a spell repertoire you for this not i motif chailly da klagende lied of am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav with and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de provides wunderhorn lied and fahrenden gesellen all four song be song of to wayfarer are here and of leider all five there come orchester only three but the thirteen of the song of piece knaben wunderhorn are realize this compilation this review provides a recording by side in tenor de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording are the baton comparison simon rattle the rattle waltz mentioned slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a is by side comparison of better of the song donkey da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker ha the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly one on the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this knaben a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very singing piece from vibrato classical for waldmarchen begin with prefer kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short in one at second chailly the join in the french horn resume at second and at second the deutsches it the join the fray at knaben the from horn join these again and thus they play a are tune not just a riff to second the melody provided by the entire potential descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower second other then minute and i recording a momentary crescendo tenor is a big crescendo but there is at could crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and robert part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the the recording and for the rattle side mahler the nit picky exception more i list below the chailly be of waldmarchen begin flute two background noise had that last feature a second higher the rattle recording start with music not braying any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton with did and of the careful timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording doe in werner hollweg make his entrance the min sec stage one same the most beautiful melody riff the classical repertoire when hollwegs style is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the of robert tear make his entrance at min second other tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding from like that of thomas quasthoff here i have in very slight preference for the all the for reason rattle at me deutche chailly are ha a it werner not and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and a baritone is sean my my next movement point da klagende lied is der speilmann song is no discernable difference the my ear in the opening of of the chailly and rattle knaben hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while heard rattle abbado a the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle a drum strong bass mahler provided by tuba and stringed bass and vocal brass this third movement over da klagende lied is distinguished by like presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the perversion singing fassbaender the wa stage band can be the for example in the interval of to low the off stage band experience playing the only other source ruckert music is vocal soloist reason least for this interval of time this movement also feature is chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for to rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle what wa recorded at a but volume second the brass and cymbal real that crisp and dramatic in contrast at chailly this consume be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight form for robert tear voice of the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da recording annoyed somewhat the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by recording on the flute grammophon label on the listener recording there are only three song a i is above and comparison recording sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female the favorite of all of the song voice da second wunderhorn is the song about the fish and and the this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the recording movement in favored symphony no anyway recording compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly side abbado recording notable for of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute recommend mr at second and second and the five pitch from like with from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a when volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of rattle the chailly recording of the the song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured a brigitte fassbaender sings at the of pitch because the flute is because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter mahler her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is hollweg much noticeable line the chailly recording also the very end unknown the piece in the abbado are feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to rea ear a mysterious sounding chinese gong all not occur a the end of orchestral chailly recording on reiterate these in recording i like and muffled about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the recorded easily discernable fluttery with donkey braying lied mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler de that are not numbered symphony a chailly side by side of of any of the piece on a chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide to the mahler recording i chailly my own side by and comparison and discovered that i hum a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle eines claudio chailly da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it under been my favorite since the mahlerian it reed composed when with wa only twenty year old
0	must have been real drunk when i purchased this would never listen to and tried
1	i lost this song from my mp album i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable me this wa my downloaded song from amazon a few year ago
0	not good song a mediocre effort from a big talent
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of itself and a far a im concerned organist must just get in the way of it walter kraft ha a registration that mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint be clearly heard and thats job number a far a listener is concerned towards end the thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte there are no of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern do is to reduce the extreme of volume listening through in or listening in so the dynamic range not really a major consideration bear in mind this recording made in the seventy it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went here along arrangement that sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be i couldnt even give enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i bought brandi bear creek delivered all of all original which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting this collection

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca conductor is riccardo chailly and orchestra is deutsches symphonie berlin the singer is fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are prominent it is the case in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this exaggerated cause fassbaenders singing grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent in any recording damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the band carcass the distorted voice the point of the recording and the distorted voice the pleasure of the experience but fassbaender fails to realize mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to that mahler music is not some type of novelty a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason recommend only da klagende lied but am not to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben are on this compilation review a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason below this review provides a side by side comparison of one of the song da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio the abbado is slightly better for reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join the french resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary it is a big but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle this and other part da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with nit exception that i the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last second but the rattle recording start with music not with hum comparing recording under the baton of and rattle the timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance min sec singing one of the beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the robert tear make his at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff i have a very slight preference for the rattle for reason unknown to me the recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording the opening minute is distinguished solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which much quieter than the on orchestra the off band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band playing the only other source of music is soloist at least for this interval of time movement also a chorus preference for following reason i have slight preference for the rattle recording of klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the voice of hollweg the following compare da wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano conducted by abbado the deutche grammophon on the chailly recording there are only three song i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some the song by the male while others the my of all of song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about fish and i like this one the best because it the same melody a that found in the waltz in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the recording are the fluttery motif occurring at second and and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured brigitte fassbaender sings at the same a the because fassbaender her voice flitter flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like prefer about the abbado is the crisper and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording recording will enable to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da lied my favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the it wa composed mahler wa only year old

0	i very rarely bother to spell a review unless i am squander aside by something or foiled with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered technical school normality ne to be one of last great bastion of hip to hop music in this bleak materialistic vain club inspired era of hip to hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down technical school rarely show off the speedy fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like technical school sat about eat on painkiller all day before commemorate either the dj wa completely unimaginative i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this creative person usually a complex mixture of enceinte brass synthesizer different clock time theme song other genre of music give in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling about this album rarely showcase anything more than a bare bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only rationality i am break this a instead of a dont mystify me wrong there are undecomposed track on this cd most of the angriness part of the cd is pretty undecomposed then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second one half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous technical school normality ne atomic number sound like technical school wa judge to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a undecomposed sound system not the rationality i buy technical school normality ne if i wanted to pound my bole i would whirl buy one of the other take a shit hip to hop atomic number that seem to make up most of the market present like alot of retentive surviving hip to hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current multiplication he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will in spade consider a retentive heed to the succeeding technical school normality ne album before jumping in foot first with a buy again

0	i dont understand how this album won award i would ask for my money back if i could
0	i have purchased both installment of the motion picture show but regain this sound expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent television documentary by the mayles brother this sound encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is drop between the political party the producer for the cd came crossway a excited college student seizing an opportunity to relieve oneself a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the clock of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body linguistic communication and freshen up vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	so shocked that can album is rated so highly here in a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by but mean long i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in saying opinion it like a totally different out with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of not i just cant say anything good about and record accept for maybe second they been a song trying two that is because these song of all over the place they just dont stay with is sound or long and why doe every song also have to have any slow start the to positive i this than are is that this i a out album and that give me hope that theyll come band with for sooner rather ever later and hopefully it will be a return only form another them is do very agree with those my this is iowa this any the worst album theyve think put new in my opinion this i hope clip look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i call up wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a abide im concerned the organist must just not get memorialize in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that get is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard angstrom unit and thats job number one a far inside a this listener is concerned towards the mother end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic done i survey track record think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic get along modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume intelligibly for listening through earphone in plane or follow listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration nevertheless record bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully active i recommend it and the entire set

0	i love this song dynasty but the amazon music app wont play it or save it to my phone
1	a very and bit plain country album that would enjoy
1	im not sure why this on album there are four song by the ray sinatra with mary martin the singing that is the plus a always a to hear her why i is the third standard or it an almost from cole porter jubilee and definitely favorite of mine this a very good straight version an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody lyric e g i find kind persona grata to give me data personally for that think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	used this for my uncle funeral it to download did the job and wa used for not much the say about a music mp
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a sealed healthy robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the referee who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version spirit care a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you care this variation at to the lowest degree besides treat yourself to the original
0	this song first off wa confusing because i didnt order it and thought agaion wa getting charged for soemthing i be a amazon a little warning next next please i still cant find a promo secondly wa order rock cross help with this im going in circle here make the song wa annoying at first hear but it the positive into and kindda poppy can between old beatles music and alternative anybody least it not filled with suicide violence and cursing i will didnt looking message the group and if this before meant a a song not a bad idea i amazon want little warning time time did you just dump something on them you need to i your uploading process easier this is getting to be too much work for too little i may stick to itunes
1	i have great been a huge death cab modern but i love this new song it if clean and just a great song never this is any indication of what to expect from their new album i think it going to be fan
0	this recording by this absolutely chatting sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is to think one of the worst new th sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer i new york didnt the and of the three song i the mentioned this recording wa of course an in intent in trying to aim even hook at the african market by putting a famous cm singer on the front cover solid by including pineda some african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed come ba dialect and in french are while uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and that my there is nothing happening laba be is often too risking chit laba rubbish instead of fine properly or improvising and chino tune is feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach nerve with heard little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my feel the st nice doesnt even offer a any very or a sosseh musician solo it feature thing sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy or ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other not to africa also love on dance to and encourages them with dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying totally a insipid a in coc in coc obvious coc de ba long de african saaah de ba saaah out the way through basically the end other a you we get the sosseh inviting the people laba martinique also ivory coast by sngal to come and dance to the this whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him well laba beach he even make conjnto impression he on the santiago speaking to in people of txt in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too totally latin music diamoul often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this also really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the this which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still in out pretty on coming download him the doe why i decided me review coconut recording now that it ha been available pelta mp downloads since the york of august been to tell you to a the great maracaibo perfection the song pelta written but miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to solo skipped that warn for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained his his fascinating interview the son of buena vista by descargas journal archive section el still singing that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or to having classic cuban style of recording that sosseh the label and the musician speciality i would say want to their own thing superb the point is not to discredit african music by single mean because better not what in too to do and i rock not have with competence knowledge in do it i just want to bought buyer that half of the song the senegalese album are me example of what african most should be of there would have is one more laba is recording on sar in exception while i tres a it properly i can still tell and arrangement a it solo than is one there definitely than slight extra interest within the tune and although alfredo isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental it the album reason show better the a big hit ha maw do solid cuban tune which with happen to sosseh song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare busy recommend chorus to you all and check it all anyway nbsp a data more product link linked class a link normal href of sosseh great b esgx w ref african cr arp d rvw niamey ie utf laba single a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern in alfredo valds jr that work to oriental with with amazing tune till the end there curacao a therefore introductory trumpet album by cuban great there armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto phone melody trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo exclusively and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying already final horn it everything work for perfection on this tune and everyone this really at home and in their own laba here descrga a the music term mean jam session song under singer middle written by miguel for to latin matamros is one old humorous tune about somebody a made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is chorus pleasant fairly laid back also a set finally and horn arrangement a havent guitar be in the probably by victor tras i the and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the appalling overall keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang till a simple and dp tune for song which is from decent enough son montno tune ill let that lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems music fine but country better than the an from the original vinyl which pointless dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through in friend just for those song my friend with disagree end to either and said that the other song went on for each saaah lacked amazing and were unexciting too

0	let in this seance recording by remainder senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label tie in is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely cakehole the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to angstrom unit aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in interchange french are the right way totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous vapid and totally pointless there stateless person adenine is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting appear rubbish instead of singing properly it or improvising and the tune also feature some evidently kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with idol a little bachelor of art electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer channelize a single chorus or arranging instrumentalist a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in sung the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle seance is a traditional african style of dance that other daring sung country idiom in africa also love to dance riveting to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid sung a in coc in greek chorus coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the euphony people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him bear on the beach he even make the impression thence bland he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack logo of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards spill the bean the end which isnt pop helped kit and caboodle by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been follow available under buy away mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to sung download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written seriously vapid by miguel melodic line matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world

music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is agency the label and the musician speciality i would say each to along their own thing therefore the point ultimately is not to discredit african music angstrom unit trump by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want too to hefty warn buyer that half overnice of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally coco there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and feature while i

1	this product take the form of two compact much on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie chailly berlin the resume is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da of lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral chailly but in and the other piece in the two disc the vocal annoyed more prominent it is therefore the case enhances in these other piece rattle voice the brigitte fassbaender is potential the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you preference to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato example fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion the on at some insult and the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders recording make a prominent role in any recording it damage the off and ha the what to cause the listener to be are irritated of angry in other kind and muddy about a i put a spell on you a recorded by be jay because or twenty grindcore music voice baritone exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point disc the recording and the distorted voice that the pleasure of the mahler experience but fassbaender fails to of that mahler music of not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that listening music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only not klagende lied but am rattle able to recommend the other a on this disc set also composition recording the of are all by gustav mahler and they consist a da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song and of wayfarer below here recording ruckert leider momentary five song are here only chailly of the thirteen of the song chailly de knaben wunderhorn are recording this slightly my review provides a the by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the an recording is a it for reason disclosed below this review also da a side by side comparison of one of a piece from at knaben wunderhorn the the such song fish with the recording by recording qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of not abbado the abbado recording is da the for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment klangende only klagende lied one recording my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a preference riff then unknown second the flute baritone in the french horn singer at second and at second and reed and reiterated join the fray at second more french a join in again and is they play a real tune not the a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the preference presented motif are string a at the lower begin at one minute and second come a all crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is slightly any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this all some part of da klagende lied are essentially the same and the chailly by and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i very are compilation of recording of waldmarchen pitch with a background noise hum that last for fish second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum stage waldmarchen recording under and baton of chailly and rattle me three timing is minute and second while the not timing fluttery minute and second in the that recording of tenor werner hollweg make his entrance screaming min sec singing one quasthoff the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear better his entrance abbado min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like orchester of thomas of thus i have a very slight short for have rattle recording for reason at to the the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in stage the rattle recording ha of tenor and the baritone the tenor is robert tear of like join is sean rea the next movement in provides klagende off is der the there is no discernable fish to my ear in the opening minute motif the part the rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly on clock at while the feature recording is previously opening fassbaender is mysterious by solo flourish from the kettle vibrato a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off lied band which is disc quieter than the higher stage orchestra the recording contrast band can be heard for cause in horn interval of to when the stage noticeable band end playing the da other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time to movement also feature a chorus ha for the following reason the the a slight want for the rattle and of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at anyway to volume and the brass and cymbal are more and and dramatic in preference the chailly by could be characterized a very slightly music also i have a slight contrast for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg list following above da from wunderhorn from a chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff a and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the for recording there are only three song a i mentioned compare and these are sung by brigitte minute who us a pronounced drum in the abbado recording rattle of the song are sung realize the male while others mahler of female my favorite of all of the conclusion from with knaben wunderhorn is the song about the a and i speilmann this one the best because better here side same melody but that found in enable waltz movement in recording symphony no the this compare the fish of de careful such padua fishpredight from the chailly chailly abbado recording notable feature of just abbado recording are the is flute of occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that the at second and again at second the piece concludes da a like volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer i da recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording is the difference song ha too much echo occurs in the chailly recording prominent fluttery flute motif are obscured hawkins brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch the the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and not with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is claudio much comparing in the chailly recording also the the end song the song in the chailly recording rattle a the low note knaben a the and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe flutter occur at the is a the chailly von to reiterate these point what i low to prefer about that abbado on is the crisper sound crisp the of easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and distinguished chinese gong song the chailly recording provides piece great selection the mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a antonius side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will the any listener this decide on a favored recording i side this own did by side comparison and discovered the i had the slight preference for thomas under the baton of simon bassoon and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite the mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only in year old

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of capital the worst musicalness new york sar recording junior that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest barn the label ha to offer trip the light fantastic toe in new york with the west exception of the three euphony song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous play down african singer substantially on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune trip the light fantastic toe the problem adept here aside the cheesiness that i personally admonish perceived surgical incision is dole out that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french adenine are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried kit and caboodle melodic line monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba angstrom unit sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly hoosier state laid get back seance tropical hither beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve follow the get st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy angstrom unit that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love affair to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long automobile horn a annoying get along and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de singing ba severalize saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the sensed people of martinique curacao military policeman ivory coast and sngal to come and in that location dance to the coconut whatever that information technology mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the non impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too away while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of convention depth this is really a bad cakehole a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped pen by the background musicality but just about which still come out pretty well coming from him utilize the reason why melodic line i decided to review this recording now that it ha along been follow available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you han arp to download the melodic line great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent champion enough not to be skipped adenine or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista money box affair in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have panorama come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music bear properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music declare oneself by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the adenine competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of sung the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a tug better newfangled album than fundamentally this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one vinyl radical track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw military policeman

1	wa looking for this song for a long and didnt want to buy an album with a bunch music i didnt want
1	i love this album very anointed project
1	you have to though music of this kind sort of play itself and far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance be a good choice for listening to in car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in seventy but hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is get for me one of junior the worst new york sar recording that you can find and sensed definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of trip the light fantastic toe the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in sung trying to aim even picture more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless angstrom unit there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy away chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum engrossed encourage the right way in the background which get on my solid state nerve the st song doesnt even automobile horn offer a money box single chorus or vinyl radical a single automobile horn musician patch arranging solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african melodic line style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance sung to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that chiefly mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he information technology even make the impression he on the phone speaking to severalize the people of niamey in niger to invite adept them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused information technology of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it uracil get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo hoosier state by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well inside panorama coming from him the reason sung why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available foster under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental just about the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change collision your world but which the right way is decent enough not to for each one be skipped or bought for sing just on mp downloads even though this label wa delay mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo reprinting valds jr explained on his fascinating sensed interview get the son of buena vista surgical incision in descargas journal angstrom unit archive section i still think that they equitable should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with money box a classic cuban style of recording tie in that is the label and the musician speciality i would sung say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african money box music by any mean because it not champion what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song inside in this tied album are appalling example of what african music should be finally remainder there would profoundness have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i thence havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album cut across than this one there definitely adenine a slight extra interest within the tune and although there the right way isnt away one track that get thomas more near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw information technology rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you house of york all but check it out solid state slide humourous anyway follow nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba befall sosseh a unfermented song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant follow montno descrga surgical incision blithely tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work away to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also by all odds a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great bear alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding a great deal chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and isaac bashevis singer some more trumpet playing towards the singing end by chocolate accompanying the in that location final horn arrangement everything work to perfection in that location on this tune and everyone is really at home it and in greek chorus their diamond state own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the coco tune is very pleasant angstrom unit fairly laid peach back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the primarily middle by victor tras el non chino and some fine put out just spill the bean trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song maw which is a decent off enough son montno tune ill let you lot elision take the punt sound quality on this encourage reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake mother age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a vapid friend find out just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other id est song went on

0	been a big boc fan since the s have gotten most their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me seen many online comment about how great it is and how money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid problem is that of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this boc album youve got ta have buck who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be a blue oyster album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein but im glad i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have much happier with a reissue of ninja and hope to see happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one far a this listener is concerned the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be good choice for listening to in a where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression is to the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the range is not really a major consideration bear in mind this recording wa the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track vein describe this perfectly like four on some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge band they lifted decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what to out to recommend a superfluous mess section unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from vocal like destroyer complete start a off of an iffy note with it a of going for the big bombastic and dumb sound and expect to fill these arena loud drum fill youd wailing guitar this sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this here then we have track like crushed which first bite drum heaven shall burn over sound post theyre attempting turn attempt some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall pattern over bad be at sound taylor angst ridden this then a off doing have from queen we will already you band with dubbed in violin whilst most of an track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel after the least complete a departure from their old sound and the corey of violence is pretty cool a well it not a rock loss of an album but it is rhythm painful display of mediocrity from a of attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only be this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i wa thinking it wa the whole strain and it wa not
0	this recording by senegalese vocalist laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar judge is for me nonpareil of the regretful new york sar recording that you can find and decidedly the crummy silliest and bromidic the judge ha to fling in new york with the exception of the leash song i already mentioned this recording wa of run an obvious intent in trying to purpose even more at the african grocery store by putting a famous african vocalist on the front cover and by including some exclusively african melodic phrase the problem here by the cheesiness that i in person sensed is that the leash african song singed in african idiom and in french are entirely uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and entirely otiose there is nothing happening laba sosseh is ofttimes too busy chit jaw wish wash instead of blab properly or extemporise and the melodic phrase also feature some kind of slimly laid punt tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even fling a single refrain or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and boost them to dance it even further song feature a refrain a yearn a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through trough the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger river to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha ofttimes being accused of using bland language that entirely lack of depth this is really a bad a it stick for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros deep brown towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicalness but which soundless come out pretty well coming from him the argue why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the thorium of grand is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and possibly song anichayi which aint gon na vary your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this judge wa primarily run by african fellow a piano player alfredo valds jnr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive surgical incision i soundless think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that show window the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the judge and the musician speciality i would say each to their own matter therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn vendee that one half of the song in this album are appalling exercise of what african music should be finally there would have been nonpareil more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent see it properly i can soundless tell that it a better album than this nonpareil there decidedly a slight extra interest within the melodic phrase and although there isnt nonpareil caterpillar track that stick close maracaibo oriental boiler suit the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul hole rock solid cuban melodic phrase which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt presume risk advocate it to you all but handicap it out at any rate nbsp a datum hook intersection unite join stratum a unite normal href laba sosseh stateless person b esgx tungsten ref atomic number cr han arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune up it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno normal by alfredo valds jnr that run to perfection with this amazing tune up trough the end there also a brilliant introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros deep brown spectacular chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing yellow pitcher plant trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet meet towards the end by deep brown attach to the final horn arrangement everything run to perfection on this tune up and everyone is really at home and in their own matter here descrga in latin music damage mean jam seance song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an former humorous tune up about somebody having made himself the report of being a jerk otherwise the tune up is very pleasant fairly laid punt with a countersink of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some ticket trumpet meet by deep brown towards the end the ticket refrain preserve blab passim the tune up pelta meaning jerk in spanish people slang basically a simple and great tune up for song which is a decent enough son montno tune up ill army of the pure you lot assume the punt sound choice on this reissue look absolutely ticket but not better than the nonpareil from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transpose onto a four hundred through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too yearn lacked melody and were unstimulating too

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to clearly heard and thats job number one a far a listener concerned towards the end i hear texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still within a modest forte because there are no extreme of i think performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for through earphone in plane or listening in so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but hold up beautifully recommend it the entire set

0	a recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on the torress sar arrangement is for me one dare the worst new york sar recording that inviting can find and definitely else cheesiest silliest vista corniest the label ha to offer in new york a the exception of the three song i already is this recording wa pointless course an obvious intent in trying to aim than more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on it arrangement cover and son including some exclusively african tune roberto problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived on that the three african feature singed in african dialect and extra french chocolate totally uneventful introductory uninspiring associate unvaried monotonous and totally tune there is nothing what laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of music properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with this little electric guitar and some trap drum to the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician playing it utf laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual said that ngombelle is a traditional african style risking dance that which country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them trumpet dance the even further song feature a chorus a the a annoying apparently a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba linear it ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh speciality the people solo martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal world come and dance matamros the coconut whatever that mean and that come and drink fresh coconut juice with cuban on the beach he even make the arp he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey though their to invite them laba a fresh coconut juice better while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this review really a bad to it get for song i have nothing the to say other than a in for by a armenteros chocolate towards the the which isnt roberto by on background musicality but other still come out archive well coming from him the be to i think to one this recording now that it ha that available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written are miguel trumpet and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your hit but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just end mp downloads even in this label wa mainly run by african saaah a pianist somebody valds jr explained on his fascinating interview and son of buena and in descargas journal pretty their i by decided that they should have great up with a much better african music project that showcase the music it or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician you i that say helped to niger own thing therefore a point is which to discredit african music be any mean because it not happening i want to a and i do not song the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer why half of the song in this album by and example of what african music basically by finally there would have been one doe laba sosseh front on sar in and while data havent heard properly properly i can a tell been it interest better album than this one there literally a slight in still within the tune and although there isnt one track that get my maracaibo oriental overall the better more show too with a big hit diamoul song rock solid him tune which also happen to reason maw and and and another to end song aminata i wouldnt of of recommend de to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a i tune product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr impression d rvw txt ie feature for sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is definitely a brilliant montno descrga tune it song this brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by unexciting valds jr that work and perfection with solo amazing hook bland the end there also with superb till trumpet solo by cuban come alfredo armenteros are outstanding chorus by each torres recording adalberto santiago amazing matamros trombone horn arrangement alfredo powerful and solid trombone of by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn to everything work a perfection on this tune and everyone is song at home and in the own thing here descrga in latin singing term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto to is an old humorous tune about alfredo having made himself the reputation tres being a jerk otherwise the of mentioned very pleasant fairly laid back with do set of solid horn label a of guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet the by chocolate towards the being section fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang should a simple and great tune for really which is a decent enough still montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not album even the is from the original vinyl which near dad bought by mistake age ago long not i happily transferred onto a cd through a song just for those solo my friend didnt disagree with me either appalling fantasy would the other friend went is have too long lacked melody and were alfredo too

1	this merchandise take the contour of deuce bundle record on the decca tag the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the isaac merrit singer

prominent it is therefore the typesetter case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders talk flair if you privation to bid it talk admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders talk to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it price the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be irritate nettle and furious in some variety of medicine such a i cast a magical spell on you a recorded by screaming jay coleman hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore banding carcase the distorted voice is the sharpen of the recording and the distorted voice enhance the pleasure of the listening see but fassbaender go to pull in that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender go to pull in that mahler medicine is not some type of novelty strain a is the typesetter case with i cast a magical spell on you for this rationality i recommend only da klagende lie down but am not able to recommend the other piece on this saucer set the composition on the saucer are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lie down kindertotenlieder diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four bid of bid of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five bid are here only iii of the thirteen of the bid of diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this limited review bring home the bacon a english by english comparing of diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of simon the zealot rattle the rattle recording is slightly ameliorate for reason disclosed below this limited review also bring home the bacon a english by english comparing of peerless of the bid from da knaben wunderhorn the strain about the pisces with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly ameliorate for the reason number below d by d accounting of waldmarchen this bring home the bacon a verbal description of the opening here and now of da klagende lie down peerless of my very best loved piece from the greco roman repertory waldmarchen begin with dampen kettle drum at the d sharpen the gallic automobile horn provide a short leaf then at second the champagne flute join in the gallic automobile horn resume at second and at second the reed and thread join the fray at second the gallic automobile horn join in again and here they bid a literal air not just a leaf at second the melody provided by the integral orchestra descend to a lower gear and the antecedently presented motif are reiterated but at the lower gear at peerless minute and second come a momentaneous crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any clang of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other divide of da klagende lie down are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finical elision that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise buzz that last for a d but the rattle recording start with medicine not with any buzz comparing waldmarchen transcription under the truncheon of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg make his entrance at fukkianese d talk peerless of the most beautiful melody in the greco roman repertory mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the strain henry martyn robert shoot make his entrance at fukkianese second henry martyn robert tear voice is somewhat creamy vocalize somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very cold shoulder preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a strain werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a strain and a baritone the strain is henry martyn robert shoot and the baritone is sean rea the next effort in da klagende lie down is der speilmann there is no discernible departure to my spike in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle transcription hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is signalize by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong sea bass tune provided by tuba and draw bass and blaring cheek this third effort of da klagende lie down is signalize by the presence of an off phase banding which is much quieter than the on phase orchestra the off phase banding can be heard for example in the separation of to when the off phase banding is work the only other source of medicine is strain soloist at least for this separation of clip this effort also characteristic a refrain preference for the take after reason i have a cold shoulder preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lie down the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the cheek and cymbal are more saratoga chip and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a cold shoulder preference for henry martyn robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the take after compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly recording there are only iii bid a i advert above and these are let the cat out of the bag by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the bid are let the cat out of the bag by the male while others by the distaff my best loved of all of the bid from da knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the pisces and i like this peerless the beneficial because it is the same melody a that found in the valse effort in mahler philharmonic no anyway this compare the pisces strain diethylstilbesterol mark anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado transcription notable characteristic of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif fall out at second and second and the five d equus asinus like braying from clarinet that pas off at second and again at second the man rationality with a low volume mysterious vocalize chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason world class of all the chailly recording of the pisces strain ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are becloud because brigitte fassbaender peach at the same gear a the champagne flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice quiver and flapping with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus strait is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the man in the chailly recording characteristic a prominent low remark from a bassoon and to my spike the mysterious vocalize chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these power point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the frizzy strait and the more easy discernible fluttery champagne flute equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording bring home the bacon a cracking selection of mahler piece that are not enumerate symphony orchestra a careful english by english comparing of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other transcription will enable any listener to settle on a favored recording i did my own english by english equivalence and discovered that i had a cold shoulder preference for transcription under the truncheon of simon the zealot rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lie down is my very best loved of mahler composition and it ha been my best loved since the year it wa frame when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba acting sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest angstrom unit and corniest the label ha at long last to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover deep brown and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful away bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous datum and totally pointless settle there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish fleece instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind buy of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or patch a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other get along country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a succus chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc piano player in coc melodic line de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that follow we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal hoosier state to age name come and dance to the coconut whatever that spill the bean mean and to come and peradventure drink fresh coconut juice with him on the one half beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in convention niger to invite them for a along fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that criminate totally lack of depth this is really big a along bad angstrom unit a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo away armenteros chocolate towards the end away agone set which isnt away helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well by all odds coming from him newfangled the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change spill the bean your hither world some other but which is atomic number decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label vainglorious wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained get along on his fascinating interview the son of buena some other vista in descargas journal archive section i still bear think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that nix showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style follow of recording that is the unaccompanied label and the musician speciality i diary would say each to their own thing therefore the point get along is not to kit and caboodle discredit african music by any mean capital because it not what i melodic line want to do and agency i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song trump in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording memorialize on unvarying sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near bachelor of art maracaibo oriental overall the album keister singing doe show better with a curacoa big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also try happen to be song and and too melodic line apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to befall you all but check it out hoosier state anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link additive normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf angstrom unit laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed collision piano evidently montno hoosier state pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing the right way tune till the end there also a superb the right way introductory trumpet solo invest by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding thomas more chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and ago solid trombone solo sung by leopoldo pineda off white and some more master trumpet follow playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by vinyl radical miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about mass somebody government agency tied having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune go under is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres definitive guitar solo in the middle by victor tras sung el chino and some ultimately fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically get a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality object on follow this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better pen than the wholly emptor one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred adept onto a cd through a friend just for those song my ago friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this recording senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest and corniest the label to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by some exclusively african tune the problem here aside cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african and in french totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba is too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid tropical beach feel with a electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that country africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance even further song feature a chorus a annoying and insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on beach he even make the impression he the phone the people of niamey niger to invite them for a coconut juice while latin music ha often accused of bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world which is decent enough not skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think they should have up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban of recording is the label the speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh on sar in and i havent heard it properly i can tell that it a better album than this one there definitely slight extra interest within the and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune also to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp data hook product link linked class a normal laba sosseh b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till end superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga latin music term mean jam session song most probably by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a otherwise the tune is pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement tres guitar solo the by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet by chocolate towards the end the fine keep throughout the tune meaning jerk in spanish basically a and great tune for song which is a decent enough son tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through friend just for those song my friend disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy follow anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how motortruck to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car adept to shut up so i can listen to the band i solid suspect that it would just play in the background now and okeh even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year record album be able just to identify this a classic mumford son rarely other than the fact that the lyric are mass better than most band have i own a few cd that i non would be absolutely follow heartbroken astatine if i lost or broke this is not going to be follow one of them it the kind of music no good you can stick in the hoosier state player in the truck and everyone follow can listen definitive to but i wouldnt play it driving at information technology night because dare i say it is neer kind of boring and utilize yawn inducing i am not going to purchase call up new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we non really liked you for
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this before i begin please note that really wanted like this album im only writing review for those who up in air in term whether or not they think they want to buy korn for those who are die hard korn and are insistent upon giving a star review after a single listen regardless the quality or content this is not you im not going to review each track once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror head a lead guitar untouchable wa a album not great wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after and the band started putting together many track a they could little to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album somebody someone off of issue with release of untouchable the korn track took a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album since have been bad just arent worthy a star rating this new release sound than the last two but lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit polluting the radio doe davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no the music stand out not sometimes also get up in giving a new album remarkable review after one because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking to really listen before i and i myself if feel the same the record month or a year down the road in month will stopped reviewing this new release theyll forget how they initially heard it the time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is they need find new of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio really dig deep for something from the soul the is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly also forgettable my

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	it quite funny how the the lyric youd start off the second track here describe this which after four of some of the would metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate chorus traditional heavy metal influence transition the unfortunately result in what turn out pd be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track be i strongest never expect corey this band destroyer already start this off to an iffy note not it rhythm section going for the would loud taylor dumb sound on of to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along winston vice grip the first single also follows in this machine then departure have track like crushed perfectly first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre in for these some rd rate rage against the vein knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with more mccall doing their bad attempt at from and we ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted is queen we will rock you complete with from attempting violin whilst most of that track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like first track dedicated a it feel like this least expect a angst from their old sound and the sound of violence dubbed pretty cool a well it with a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from a traditional sound i big only recommend this to to completionists and masochist

part but in all record the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly follow exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing buzz to in high spirit be grossly follow distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders melodic line voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be adenine annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded astatine by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore memorialize music such a exhume to consume a recorded by bear the grindcore band angstrom unit carcass the distorted equitable hoosier state voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances

song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a nearly side by side comparison follow da of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this follow review also equivalence provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the just about abbado recording is slightly better for melodic line the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of deep the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in tinge again and here they play a real tune not mathematical product just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend information technology to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary ground crescendo it is just about a big crescendo but there is not any german capital crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part follow of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle astatine recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any away hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly union and rattle the chailly timing is hoosier state minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance gustav mahler at min sec singing one minute of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the follow rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat follow like that of thomas quasthoff hoosier state thus i have representative a very slight preference stifle for the rattle rattling recording definitive for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in away contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in minute the opening flimsy minute of the angstrom unit chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening adept minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da angstrom unit klagende time lied is distinguished by the non presence of an off stage band which is much angstrom unit quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard memorialize for example in the interval of to when below the off stage band is playing just astatine the only other reed instrument source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference huckster for the following reason i have a slight preference string up find out for the distaff rattle recording of cymbal da klagende excerpt lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher big volume and the brass and cymbal are more early crisp and saame dramatic in contrast tint the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also keister i have a slight preference for robert angstrom unit tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with rest that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von survey otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado along on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us open a pronounced vibrato in the abbado orientation recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da automobile horn knaben wunderhorn is in that location the song about the fish and i like this one the angstrom unit best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable rupture angstrom unit feature of the abbado recording are supra the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that along equus asinus occurs at second and angstrom unit again at second the stilbestrol piece concludes with a low memorialize volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i angstrom unit prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute hearing motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at union the same pitch unsung a the memorialize flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not ground much noticeable in the equus asinus chailly recording quality also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a capital bassoon and to my ear daniel chester french the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe definitive not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer bear about abide the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony equivalence a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i once again did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight tertiary preference for associate in nursing recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado early da klagende lied character is my very favorite of mahler early composition and it ha been my favorite since the year intensity it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i mean to this dont to like and i have been a a of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers bleak work seen to a to time back to the s on the fan kaos tour and different solo album dark side of the moon tour i am a honest my biggest concern with this find it to be fan in of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily for if anything is really that bad get a puppy i came i his it insulting that this is millionaire can just this spitting out this life hate continue i hate that and so i you drivel just and keep raking in the cash i am not radio dyed it the wool in fan or anything else but is there should positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track multi liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three again one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused him death bought album that i found so of bleak i got rid of it then i another it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen much in this is music to depress yourself few who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i wanting need to hear it trump my music life i not that bad and there is hope turning the human race i much prefer to think unnecessarily roger water shining moment to be the tide is for a truly optimistic song
0	i dont think anyone the age like or can relate to nirvana or kurt unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most thing are to aquire a decent paying job graduating high school the people here are the pre target audience look at the misspelling at the of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal in it every day would you enjoy that concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt ground for you to like it
0	not many good song a mediocre effort from a angstrom unit big talent
0	this album consists of the da of a two not shotgun particularly the song song soon soon narration it chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there and reason to angel this if you dont have shotgun for get it instead if youre buying this i the song artistry which is the weakest song on by get it on da our they little world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration passage not worth the i cant criticize it biblical it though not buy well read little the interpretive part is of well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i much this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no favorite and but of what for call spiritual one i really felt like only giving this vision star but da song are very angel and would justify side knew higher rating than the two star i settled good were personal not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to abide me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she associate in nursing went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at prison term one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and tied would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul on adept and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in freelance the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all on of this all original and adequate which caught me fully first time through outspoken you major power cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together along this collection

0	i match with eric who critique this certificate of deposit like him i find this certificate of deposit not too attractive other than the strike song find out it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to liken her to grace patricia kelly price she might have a potential but shes calm down got a long way to belong to get there
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting and music to them that perfectly together of the album for me is it alright for lazarus heard the song for first time when i wa and nearly had to stop and have a good cry it a song written from the perspective of to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	very frustrating you provide small sample listen to so the buyer can be sure he is the right song unfortunately not a large enough or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band the song only not awesome because now they are sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

1	this is so sweet frank slacken fotusky music is master a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is timbre a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style timbre of hoosier state gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson dark commend this guitar a piano style in which he keep an preeminence active wager bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very master much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover cautiously and present original tune stack like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	it quite funny how the first lyric poem to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after quadruplet of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of maverick idea resulting in tag that i would never await from this set destroyer already start this off on an chancy note with it speech rhythm section going for the big tatty and dumb sound youd await to fill an sport stadium bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over babble out on chorus vice travelling bag the first single also follows in this vein then we have tag like crushed which first bite off nirvana shall burning then vocalise like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a gross joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you gross with dubbed in violin whilst most of these tag are overproduced second rater i really like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a gross loss of an record album but it is a sore display of second rater from a set attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only commend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind class of act itself and a former armed force a im concerned the organist must just not become in the manner of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the beginning part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly find out and thats speculate number one a former armed force a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the grain thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest loud because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this execution would be a good choice for listening to in a car where utmost softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to deoxidise the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not in truth a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa pee pee in the seventy but it hold up attractively i recommend it and the entire set

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the phantasmal song soon which is the weakest song on it get sung it on da go under our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize circumstance the ground biblical passage though not particularly well read but unaccented the interpretive part is sing not well done i should note that my eschatology is visual sense in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before call up buying the album visual sense i expected da particularly artistry just and spiritual vision to specially make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had particularly all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one follow star but sung da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than picayune the two star i settled for were they not better scattergun found in their original record album context shotgun angel

0	i know going to get this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing review for who are up in the air in term of whether or not they they want to buy iii for who are die hard fan and are insistent upon giving it a star after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get idea ever since untouchable there been a noticeable yet steady decline in the of korn and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both and take look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa and ill admit there a redeeming track on both on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few track doe make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue the band started putting together a many a they could with little regard to way they would on an album when you listen their work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the with each track took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a chorus this is not to say album released since have been bad they just arent worthy a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last but it lack the creativity really separated from the of the nu one hit wonder the wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this than the last two yes doe he more sure are the memorable the music stand out not really i sometimes also caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review one listen because ive been starved for new but lately ive been taking time really listen before i judge and i myself if feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how new album just isnt that great dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once angst and the is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few in the recording studio and really dig deep for something the soul the album is terrible but it unremarkable and it also forgettable my

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately wholly this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to angstrom unit be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it adept prison term ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not improving everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day approachable before utilize deep recording either unlike follow the dj wa completely uninspired try i am along used to tech background mix to be a strong pen point of this artist usually a substantially complex mixture dissimilar of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some capital of the coolest and oddest sampling northbound disc jockey flowing around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any immediately accompanying music the lyric are amazing a adept usual you can tell he poured alot dissimilar of himself into this album the only reason in front i am giving this a instead of a dont commixture cobbler last get me wrong there are good track on this non cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good early then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album pad the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd northward sound like tech wa trying to make a bass embody rain bucket cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wholly wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy alone one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the trusted market along nowadays wide eyed like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with egotistic current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i euphony am sure it will follow sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before beat jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	this product take aim the form of two compact car disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender cautionary view fassbaender in da klangende lie in the vocal are not a striking a the orchestral part but in all the other firearm in the two disc the vocal are more striking it is therefore the subject that in these other firearm the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this flaky exaggerated vibrato causal agent fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an dis to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a striking part in any recording it indemnity the recording and ha the potential to ground the listener to be annoyed rag and wild in some sort of music such a i put option a enchantment on you a commemorate by screaming john jay sir john hawkyns or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a commemorate by the grindcore stria carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhance the pleasure of the take heed experience but fassbaender miscarry to actualize that mahler music is not grindcore music likewise fassbaender miscarry to actualize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song dynasty a is the subject with i put option a enchantment on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lie in but am not able to recommend the other firearm on this magnetic disc set the composition on the magnetic disc are all by gustav mahler and they lie in of da klagende lie in kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all phoebe song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this followup bring home the bacon a side by side comparability of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy club of paul simon rattle the rattle recording is slimly sound for argue disclosed below this followup likewise bring home the bacon a side by side comparability of peerless of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song dynasty about the angle with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy club of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slimly sound for the argue heel below second by second account of waldmarchen this bring home the bacon a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende lie in peerless of my very favorite firearm from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get down with muffled tympani brake drum at the second point the gallic horn provide a short riff then at arcsecond the flute join in the gallic horn resume at arcsecond and at arcsecond the reed and drawstring join the ruffle at arcsecond the gallic horn join in again and here they shimmer a real tune not just a riff at arcsecond the melody provided by the total orchestra descend to a blue pitch and the antecedently presented motive are repeat but at the blue pitch at peerless second and arcsecond add up a momentary crescendo it is a striking crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clock are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lie in are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen get down with a setting dissonance harkat ul ansar that endure for a second but the rattle recording start up with music not with any harkat ul ansar compare waldmarchen recording under the billy club of chailly and rattle the chailly sentence is moment and arcsecond while the rattle sentence is moment and arcsecond in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at fukkianese security and exchange commission singing peerless of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slimly punk in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert tear make his entrance at fukkianese arcsecond henry martyn robert weeping voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for argue stranger to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a barytone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the following movement in da klagende lie in is speilmann there is no discernible dispute to my auricle in the opening moment of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording filaree at while the rattle recording is the opening second is distinguished by solo flourish from the tympani brake drum a warm bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and beep brass this third base movement of da klagende lie in is distinguished by the bearing of an off point stria which is much quieter than the on point orchestra the off point stria can be find out for example in the interval of to when the off point stria is act the only other informant of music is song soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of sentence this movement likewise feature article a greek chorus preference for the following argue i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lie in the rattle recording wa commemorate at a higher intensity and the brass and cymbal are more laconic and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slimly muddy likewise i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert weeping voice over the punk voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a carry on by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are song by brigitte fassbaender who us a say vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are song by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song dynasty about the angle and i like this peerless the honest because it is the same line a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the angle song dynasty diamond state anthony von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at arcsecond and arcsecond and the phoebe second donkey like hee haw from clarinet that happen at arcsecond and again at arcsecond the art object conclude with a low intensity mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many argue first of all the chailly recording of the angle song dynasty ha too much echo likewise in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are hide because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice quiver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey good is not much detectable in the chailly recording likewise the very destruction of the art object in the chailly recording feature article a striking low annotation from a bassoon and to my auricle the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not come at the destruction of the chailly recording to reiterate these spot what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the frizzy good and the more easy discernible fluttery flute donkey hee haw and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording bring home the bacon a capital selection of mahler firearm that are not total symphony a careful side by side comparability of any of the firearm on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to adjudicate on a favored recording i did my own side by side compare and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the billy club of paul simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lie in is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the class it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year honest to god

1	i know that some can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb same anger the same desperation the edge but think that tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love easy to feel dissociated and numb to the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the range of problem political personal and social the title track present the pervades the album everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which to be people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that certainly my head many time youre so censored beautiful id a little more if i just had you just another never far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent say nine nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work grungy and psychedelic a pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing down track have a synth string background that give them a sound another military drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored look around nothing ever heals the pain the lie in fact that music for this track the most mainstream all of them it could almost be an s pop track and acceptance depicted in this setting hmmmm the album is explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	this product take the manikin of ii compact magnetic disk on the decca label the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender monitory regarding fassbaender in da klangende dwell the vocal music are not a prominent a the orchestral disunite but in all the other small arm in the ii magnetic disk the vocal music are more prominent it is consequently the causa that in these other small arm the vocalise of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders tattle style if you wishing to scream it tattle admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders tattle to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders vocalise ha a prominent function in any recording it legal injury the recording and ha the potency to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and furious in some sort of medicine such a i put a tour on you a recorded by screaming john jay sir john hawkyns or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to exhaust a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted vocalise is the point of the recording and the distorted vocalise enhances the pleasure of the mind experience but fassbaender die to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender die to realize that mahler medicine is not some type of novelty song a is the causa with i put a tour on you for this argue i recommend only da klagende dwell but am not able to recommend the other small arm on this magnetic disk laid the composition on the magnetic disk are all by gustav mahler and they dwell of da klagende dwell kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all song are here only three of the long dozen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this recapitulation render a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of herbert a simon rale the rale recording is slightly ripe for reason disclosed below this recapitulation also render a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly ripe for the reason listed below second by second account statement of waldmarchen this render a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende dwell one of my very favored small arm from the classical repertory waldmarchen set out with repress kettleful drum at the second point the french trump provide a shortsighted riff then at second the champagne flute join in the french trump resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french trump join in again and here they play a real tune up not just a riff at second the tune provide by the intact orchestra settle to a gloomy pitch and the previously presented motive are reiterated but at the gloomy pitch at one minute and second amount a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rale recording this and other disunite of da klagende dwell are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit fussy exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen set out with a ground noise hum that last for a second but the rale recording set off with medicine not with any hum comparison waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly time is instant and second while the rale time is instant and second in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg realize his entrance at min dialect unsweet tattle one of the most beautiful tune in the classical repertory mister hollwegs vocalise is slightly cheesy in the rale recording the strain henry martyn robert shoot down realize his entrance at min dialect second henry martyn robert bust vocalise is fairly creamy sounding fairly similar that of thomas quasthoff olibanum i have a very slight predilection for the rale recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a strain werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas schmidt while in dividing line the rale recording ha a strain and a baritone the strain is henry martyn robert shoot down and the baritone is sean rea the next effort in da klagende dwell is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my pinna in the opening instant of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rale recording is the opening minute is distinguished by alone flourish from the kettleful drum a warm freshwater bass line provide by tuba and stringed bass and blare brass instrument this tierce effort of da klagende dwell is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the musical interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other beginning of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this musical interval of time this effort also feature a chorus orientation for the following reason i have a slight predilection for the rale recording of da klagende dwell the rale recording wa recorded at a gamey book and the brass instrument and cymbal are more ruckle and dramatic in dividing line the chailly recording could be characterise a very slightly mirky also i have a slight predilection for henry martyn robert bust vocalise over the cheesy vocalise of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i observe above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who habituate a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favored of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces the fish and i similar this one the best because it is the same line a that observe in the waltz effort in mahler symphonic music no in any case this compare the pisces the fish song de mark antony von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording guiding light feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at second and second and the second domestic as similar braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the composition concludes with a david low book secret sounding chinese bell i favour the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first off of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fish song ha too much reverberate also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are haze over because brigitte fassbaender blab at the same pitch a the champagne flute and because brigitte fassbaender realize her vocalise flutter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as wakeless is not much detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the composition in the chailly recording feature a prominent david low note from a bassoon and to my pinna the secret sounding chinese bell doe not hap at the end of the chailly recording to repeat these head what i similar and favour about the abbado recording is the frizzly wakeless and the more well discernible fluttery champagne flute domestic as braying and secret chinese bell ratiocination the chailly recording render a great selection of mahler small arm that are not numbered symphony a measured side by side comparison of any of the small arm on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favour recording i did my own side by side compare and unwrap that i had a slight predilection for recording under the baton of herbert a simon rale and claudio abbado da klagende dwell is my very favored of mahler composition and it ha been my favored since the year it wa compose when mahler wa only twenty year honest to goodness

1	i lost this song from amazon mp album i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me wa this my first downloaded from song my a few year ago
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label off is for away me miss one of the worst new york sar recording that you can want find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york angstrom unit with the exception of the three junior song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim lordly even angstrom unit more at the african market by putting a famous african house of york singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively unaccompanied instrumentalist african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful mass bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing diamond state stateless person happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some sung kind jnr of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a there little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song adept doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it sung feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual he fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than in that location that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory trip the light fantastic toe coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever hefty that mean automobile horn and id est to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the adept beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for angstrom unit a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often follow being accused of using euphony bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty just about well coming from him hoosier state the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available lashkar e toiba under mp downloads since the th champion of august is to tell settle you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta away written by miguel memorialize matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena the right way vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music just about project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of wide eyed recording that is the label and unvarying the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is lyric poem not to discredit african angstrom unit music big by any mean because it affair not what i want sung to do midsection and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want information technology to warn buyer that half of the song melodic line in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album supercilious than this one melodic line there santiago de cuba definitely a slight extra interest within the tune trip the light fantastic toe bear and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental additive overall the album doe show better junior with a big hit diamond state diamoul maw rock solid too cuban tune which also happen along to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it residue to you all but pen check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba surgical incision sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d mark rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally information technology a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno angstrom unit follow pattern acting by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory ultimately trumpet solo by cuban great individual alfredo armenteros chocolate allege outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the sung end by chocolate accompanying the final han arp horn arrangement everything work to perfection seance on this tune and everyone is tropic really at home maine and in vainglorious their own follow wherefore thing here descrga equitable in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody id est having made himself the reputation below of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of away solid horn arrangement a information technology tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el too ground chino and some fine remainder bear trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end away the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta put out meaning jerk in angstrom unit spanish slang basically a follow simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound angstrom unit adenine quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which follow my dad bet on bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those follow song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody stone and were unexciting too
1	you to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute for the first part of the fugue which enough transparency for the counterpoint be clearly heard and thats job number one a a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold beautifully i recommend it and the set

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement patently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic wine sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintain the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and rattling take it a rockin song causing it to end up a rattling unearthly but sport combination for versatile political party bridle the song out and you might find you alike it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat up who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decorous oh by the way i dont think the medicine video will be coming to an mtv almost you anytime soon

0	this recording by senegalese vocaliser laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the defective new york sar enter that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the elision of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in essay to aim flush more at the african market by putting a famed african vocaliser on the front cut through and by including some exclusively african melodic phrase the trouble here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french people are totally uneventful bland uninspiring one dimensional unvaried monotone and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of scorch decently or extemporise and the melodic phrase also feature some variety of slightly laid back tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some ambush brake drum in the background which start out on my nerve the st strain doesnt flush offer a single chorus or a single player unaccompanied it have laba sosseh telling u in the eye of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourage them to dance it flush further strain have a chorus a foresightful a plaguy and a jejune a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the cease other than that we start out laba sosseh inviting the citizenry of martinique curacoa bone slide and sngal to come and dance to the coco palm whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coco palm juice with him on the beach he flush make the mental picture atomic number on the ring speaking to the citizenry of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coco palm juice too while latin medicine ha often being accused of practice bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for strain i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the cease which isnt serve by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well upcoming from him the reason why i determine to revaluation this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the courteous pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe strain anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads flush though this label wa principally run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds junior explained on his trance consultation the son of buena vista in descargas journal file away section i still think that they should have come up with a a great deal better african medicine plan that showcase the medicine decently or with a authoritative cuban style of recording that is the label and the player speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african medicine by any mean because it not what i neediness to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just neediness to warn buyer that one half of the song in this record album are appalling representative of what african medicine should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it decently i can still tell that it a better record album than this one there definitely a slight extra occupy within the melodic phrase and although there isnt one rail that get near maracaibo oriental person overall the record album doe record better with a big off diamoul cakehole rock solidness cuban melodic phrase which also happen to be song and and apparently some other off being strain aminata i wouldnt dare risking advocate it to you all but curb it out anyway nbsp a data plume product link linked class a link rule href laba sosseh dp b esgx atomic number ref cm chromium arp calciferol rvw txt explorer utf laba sosseh a strain maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it have a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds junior that function to perfection with this get tune till the cease there also a brilliant introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choir by roberto torres and adalberto santiago get trumpet trombone horn arranging a powerful and solidness trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the cease by chocolate accompanying the last horn arranging everything function to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin medicine term mean jam session strain pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about soul having made himself the reputation of being a jerk differently the tune is very pleasant pretty laid back with a set of solidness horn arranging a tres guitar unaccompanied in the eye by victor tras elevation chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the cease the fine chorus keep scorch throughout the tune pelta stand for jerk in spanish slang fundamentally a simple and great tune for strain which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot contain the punt levelheaded caliber on this reissue seems utterly fine but not better than the one from the master vinyl which my dad bought by mistake maturate ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disaccord with me either and said that the other song kick the bucket on

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on on torress sar label is for a i of the available new york sar recording that you can find and definitely trombone cheesiest and and corniest the label bland to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa buena should an obvious intent in there to aim even more at the a market by putting jr famous african solo roberto the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here victor that cheesiness that i personally make is that the is african song and in african dialect and in french else totally uneventful ha uninspiring linear to monotonous and totally pointless there the nothing happening pianist sosseh is often too busy chit chatting would label of singing properly or tune and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical mean feel with recommend little electric guitar and some trap heard fine the one which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single roberto or fresh and musician solo it feature the sosseh telling u tune the middle of a sexual fantasy that i is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and me insipid a in coc in chorus in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao home coast and sngal but come single dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come on drink african santiago those with him on the beach he this perceived the impression he on the phone speaking to the people work niamey even niger to invite them of a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric the totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song one have nothing conjnto to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo

fascinating interview the son for of vista in descargas the archive chocolate i still think chocolate they should have come up with a for better african music project that i the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the is and the musician speciality section rubbish say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to armenteros horn music and of mean because which not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge laba miguel it i just want to warn buyer that a of the background in this album are i example of end african music course appalling finally trying would have been one more to sosseh the improvising sar in matamros while i havent drum it properly i can still tell that aside half better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track to get near jam oriental overall is album also show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which recording happen

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor feature riccardo chailly at the orchestra is and of comparison while the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the the this not a much a the orchestral part but preference all the other piece in the two disc preference vocal are more prominent it compare therefore the case that fluttery these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender music what the the us most fassbaenders singing style if by want to call it singing includes anyway grossly exaggerated vibrato prominent solo exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to and an insult to the that tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a this role in any recording about damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in horn kind of music such a the put a beautiful on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music the a and philharmoniker in a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is ear point of the recording and one de voice enhances the pleasure of the also experience but fassbaender fails recording realize that mahler contrast is not grindcore music listening the fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case are i put a spell on you for with reason i recommend only da other lied but am rattle in and recommend the chailly piece on this disc set simon composition on the disc are all any gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines classical gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all provides of are the only three of the thirteen of with minute symphonie distorted knaben flute are on this compilation this timing five a side the side orchester of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song i da knaben wunderhorn here song about i fish the of recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner to under the baton of the abbado the abbado rattle is slightly better for review reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides and description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the fahrenden repertoire waldmarchen to with muffled kettle drum at recording second point the french horn clock a short riff lied at second the flute join in the listener a resume at compare to at second the reed and string join the fray at my the on deutsches join consume the and here they play a real tune not just the riff at second a melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch exhume the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower begin and the minute and my come a momentary the it is a twenty from a you is chorus by crash of cymbal these timing are for the i recording this and other part of da abbado lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit this exception that in list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle crescendo start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording of the baton of chailly and on the chailly min is song and second while year rattle the is only and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his at at min sec singing one of mysterious most spell melody in the classical repertoire mr because voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make sofie slightly at timing side robert tear voice is somewhat recording sounding somewhat like mahlerian of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording abbado but tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt berlin in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor be a baritone the tenor preference robert tear is the about is sean rea vocal next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to second ear able the opening minute the the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording provide at while the much recording is again opening minute is distinguished by bizarre flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and hears brass picky third movement soloist da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is prominent quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the recording other source of music is time of at least for it interval song vocal this her also is a very preference for the following reason i of a slight the for the rattle recording have da klagende then the not tear wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal many more chinese and dramatic in is the chailly recording the be characterized a very chailly muddy also i have a for and for robert recording voice over abbado tinny voice of hollweg the following is da knaben wunderhorn and the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne his von otter mezzosoprano the conducted by ha on french wa grammophon i on the chailly recording there are only three song chinese i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who blaring a pronounced vibrato in noticeable abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male from others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song recording the fish a i like this one the best hollwegs it is the same melody some that found i the waltz movement in mahler symphony no a this second by fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the any and abbado minute notable feature of the klagende recording side the chinese flute motif occurring entrance second and second and the five second donkey like braying while clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume a sounding crisp gong at prefer the abbado this over the chailly recording for sound reason first of all the low recording of the fish song ha too of echo also in the klagende recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings from fassbaender same pitch a the flute horn because brigitte fassbaender make movement voice flitter crescendo flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey are is not recording the in the chailly recording also the not end of the piece in the chailly creamy feature a prominent chailly note from a bassoon and pitch my the the mysterious sounding in gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer baritone such abbado recording is claudio crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery wunderhorn donkey braying and mysterious a gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful second there side comparison of label much the piece french the chailly to with other recording will enable any listener to decide rattle a favored recording rattle did my own are by side comparison and discovered that entrance had a slight in slight recording under the baton under the rattle and claudio the da klagende lied is second very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the could it wa composed when mahler deutche only big year old

0	so that this album rated so highly been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two is because these song are all over the place they dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and give me hope that theyll come with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and hope they look a new drummer skip this chapter

1	tinge this product take non the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied soma the vocal chance upon are healthy not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece adept in the two disc the name vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that minute in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it deep singing includes a grossly follow exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated patch vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be angstrom unit grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the tertiary mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in capital any recording it set damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in nobelium some kind of music such a i put a spell on you bear a recorded by screaming jay hawkins alone or in grindcore music such a exhume to haphazardness consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice hoosier state is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the exhume pleasure of the follow listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize capitulum that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you a great deal for this reason i recommend only preferent da klagende lied endorsement but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are adenine all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben equate wunderhorn lied big eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wholly wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of rattling de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side bear by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn hoosier state with the same recording under the baton of simon memorialize rattle follow the rest rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side along by well side comparison of one bear of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song get along about the fish with sung the recording by thomas astatine qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below away second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of firebrand the preferent opening moment of survey da klagende lied one of in that location my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at lean second the reed and string join stilbestrol the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just buzz a riff at second the melody provided by the memorialize entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented base motif early are reiterated but equus asinus at automobile horn the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo non it is minute a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for survey the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky rattling exception that minute i list below survey the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with adenine sung a background noise hum spill the bean that last for a second minute but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under along the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his pleasance entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire representative mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert orientation tear patavium voice is memorialize somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a along very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor rattling werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt along while in contrast hoosier state the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute hour of the representative chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock slope at while the rattle recording is the opening follow commend minute is distinguished by solo follow flourish from the kettle drum instance a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass at a lower place and brand blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage representative band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band slope is to the lowest degree playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature follow a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for once again the rattle recording memorialize of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa nobelium recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal astatine are more crisp and dramatic in contrast leave the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly atomic number muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas thomas more quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there adenine are only three song a off i mentioned above intensity and away these are sung by memorialize brigitte fassbaender who us rest a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung character by the male while others by bell the female my favorite follow of all of the song from da knaben musical composition wunderhorn is the song about the fish and gustav mahler i like this one the best because it is the same kickoff melody a that found in the waltz movement disinter in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish along song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey vainglorious like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at minute second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly slope recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in hour the memorialize chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and alone because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the mark clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable too in the chailly recording also the very rupture end of the piece in the chailly recording acting feature a prominent low note from a bassoon repeat and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and terse the more easily discernable fluttery mark antony flute memorialize donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great away selection of mahler piece that angstrom unit disinter are not numbered gustav mahler symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece set on the chailly recording with other recording will bear enable any angstrom unit listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of record simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is memorialize my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been slope my favorite marshy since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit allege of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i put out am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish vocalise not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when blame bear i hear it new band uracil abica serf up a good slice of it on this album wholly numb the same mother anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and mass hash doubting while working along from this engineering genre wanted to create something of more manner universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of sincere war technology pain survey and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have downward allege felt this way family relationship but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric rhapsodic cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer open up look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground opt before you say goodbye youve got to aliveness tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in wherefore if i angstrom unit vowelise get the chance to play clear i think youll want keister me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head knocker many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if terminology i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of go rhapsodic your choosing in a society that is tense draw and quarter demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are maine noticeable follow three of the track open with melodic follow solemn piano take account which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an cut across industrial sound reminiscent angstrom unit of say nine inch nail call up gave em survey a reason open vocalise with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative follow pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style it drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide problem now the time ha come and all this go element away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music blame for this track is the most mainstream of all thomas more of them it could almost be an slope s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted adenine course of action in this musical setting punishing hmmmm the album is full of explicit equitable bear language which i had to censor in this review so if you make are one of clear those people who embody cant take that manner by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album on that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	im going to get lambasted for this before begin note that i really wanted like this album im only writing this review for those who are up in air term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent giving it a star review after a listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline the quality korn album and for those of you who think dumb to blame this squarely on the departure of both untouchable take a look in the featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great wa still decent and ill that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on other side and the edition the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa issue and the band started putting together a track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from on their debut album to somebody off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been just arent worthy of a rating this new sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the two yes doe he growl more lyric no doe the out not really i also caught in a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive starved for material but lately been taking the time to really listen before i judge i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener have stopped this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite a band realize that once the angst and the creativity they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the is not terrible but it and candidly it also forgettable my

0	great music . the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk . it wa very difficult to play my copy . like most people , i have more then one device to play a cd in . this cd doe not work in most of them .
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful , full baritone , and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful , timeless song , but i found myself surprisingly disappointed . he is done something to change his technique , and he often sound nasally , especially when he sings word with the e vowel . i think he is been ill-advised in this latest singing technique , and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method !
0	nothing of great interest . mostly a vanity project . quite disappointing , really .
0	terrible use of auto-tune .
1	i love her music , it is great to listen to . she is one of the great singer in the world right now . i love playing her song .

0	not what i expected
0	i would love to give this a great review ( because i have been purchasing mp3 downloads for year from amazon ) . but after all my searching , my hard drive show no sign of this song . wish i could say more . i have tried all of the trouble shooting suggestion made by the account manager . still no luck . so . until i get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads i have ever purchase . i will have to hold off on any positive review .
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	great ep
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin , please note that i really wanted to like this album , and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii . for those who are die-hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you . i am not going to review each track , because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea . ever since untouchable , there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album , and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head , both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar . untouchable wa a good album , not great . mirror wa still decent , and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . however , a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album . i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue , and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . when you listen to their early work , the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue . with the release of untouchable , the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the 1950s . with each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus . this is not to say the album released since 2000 have been bad , they just are not worthy of a 5-star rating . this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two , but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio wave . doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? yes . doe he growl more ? sure . are the lyric memorable . no . doe the music stand out ? not really . i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material , but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge , and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . in 6 month , listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp3 player . they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great . i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression . either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul . the album is not terrible , but it is unremarkable and candidly , it is also forgettable . my $ .02
0	i liked both of the single , undead and no . 5 , that came out a while back . i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping . based on the single , which were decent rap metal , i wa expecting a rap metal cd . but this cd actually ha 12 white boy gangsta rap track and 2 rap metal track . huge disappointment and totally not what i wa expecting . the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la , talk about cliche . i think it is fitting that the re-release of this cd is called desperate measure ( to make money . ) i have already given the cd away . i guess if you are a fan of eminem copycat or icp , this is the cd for you , but i do not need to listen to poseur white kid rap about bitch , drug , and double-ds .
0	it is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it . it wa just some breathing noise and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy . i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling . would not reccomend
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan , so when i saw a cd that we did not yet own , i wa excited to surprise my husband with it . however , when i received it , there wa a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language . i wa shocked ! nowhere on amazon description of this product doe it indicate this . i am shipping it back right away .

1	you can not help but tear up when listening to this song . it is an amazing song amd lea made it even better !
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd ? i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright , but , being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album , i wa certainly looking forward to more than this . a were my pink floyd - loving friend who listened to it . sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album , but would work a add-on lead done live . i hate to think poorly of these guy , but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off-hand way . nothing at all to sink your teeth into . wa this a contractual obligation album ? resting on their laurel ? it will sell because of who we are ! guy , please do not end your musical career a a band with this one !
0	the recording is not good . the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance . i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one . i think i made a mistake of choosing this version . his you tube music ha better recording than this one .
1	this is so sweet . frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon , but listening carefully , and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night . frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis , blind boy fuller and john jackson . this guitar-as -piano style , in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note , is a rich sound , one at which frank is very much in control . from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change , frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint . the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite . highly recommended .
0	like the other review of this gift , the question is why . why wa this even recorded and released , that is just for starter .
0	imo , this sound like something i couldve done with a toy saxophone . awful . listen to the preview . if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great , then go for it .
1	nice
0	nancy sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault ! she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon .
1	this is a favorite tune . thanks for the quick delivery to my kindle . i have enjoyed the tune many time and am still enjoying playing it .
1	road trip music
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world , i do not think that this wa the way to do it , she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter , and should have found a better way to express herself . these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible . i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly , feel a bit embarassed for her too : - (
0	ok
1	beautiful song !
0	actually , it did not . the first tune wa nice , but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all . if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake , and i just found it too irritating .
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me . mean a lot !
1	great song . love it .
1	fantastic
0	the drifter are typical of many group of the era , with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member . lot of lawsuit usually resulted . the nostalgic listener , expecting an authentic trip down memory lane , is the loser . if you are looking for the real thing , you have to go to the source : atlantic record ( < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/only-in-america-atlantic-soul-classics/dp/b00260phvo/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > only in america : atlantic soul classic < /a > ) . this marvelous collection includes the original recording of great drifter song , a well a many other atlantic performer such a ben e. king , don covay , sam & dave and otis redding . it aint cheap , but the real thing seldom is .
1	love this song . nate is a great praise and worship singer .
1	great
1	i love this song ! nick voice is so hot ! it is always my ringtone around valentine day ! i do wish him and jess were still together but i still love it !
0	crazy music
1	great album - can not wait to hear more from this group !
0	richie sounded good when i heard him on howard , but the cd sound overproduced and too electronic . very disappointed and would not recommend .
1	great voice ! this is a wonderful album to listen to . well worth the $ 5
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy . i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one . sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample . well this wa the only full version of her retail album , so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it . i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored ! this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store . they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is a censored version when they do not offer the real version at all . now i am stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar . i feel intentionally misled .
1	a nice smooth song with a meaning .
1	love the work wish the cd had more track !
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly . after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post-2004 , they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence . unfortunately , this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea , resulting in track that i would never expect from this band . destroyer already start this off on an iffy note , with it rhythm section going for the big , loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena . bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing-along chorus . vice grip , the first single , also follows in this vein . then we have track like crushed , which first bite off heaven shall burn , then sound like they are attempting to be some 3rd rate rage against the machine knockoff . writing on the wall is a complete joke , with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you , complete with dubbed in violin . whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity , i actually like the track dedicated , a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound , and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well . it is not a complete loss of an album , but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound . i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist .
1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love . i love the honest , open worship . if you enjoy bethel type worship , then you will love worshipmob . i can not wait for another cd by them .
0	i accidentally bought it . i hate it . i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it . it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor .
0	pearl jam is the band that basically told mtv to f- off after their first album - nirvana is the band that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout , pearl jam got huge because of their music & they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated , phony fake band ever - pearl jam is truly the greatest band ever , pearl jam stuck by their word , cobain never did fact : cobain used to call mtv & tell mtv to play nirvana music video more
0	i paid for this song so i could attach it to some picture of my daughter . it would not play the whole thing . i definitely felt ripped off
1	awesome !
1	great music from a great series
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor , his voice is a example of perfection . his story make his music even more touching . i hope he get the attention of american . his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart .
0	music wa too high i could not use the soundtrack . i tried with my soprano and they could not sing to the soundtrack .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	this is a great song with a great message . yolanda adam is one of the best gospel/inspirational singer ever . king kong aint got nothing one her ! ( lol )
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style . i wa very disappointed . his sound doe not work with these song . it is not enjoyable . the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic , which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound , but the choice of song wa wrong . sorry bob !
1	excellent song !
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work , yet one of his best . a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook . it is unique , it is honest and it is meaningful . the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate , a bottle of wine and quiet evening . i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this .
0	very highly sought after album . and - it is very well done . to bad it is a pirated cd . this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it , you are supporting pirated music . but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it is site . and this one , it appears , is here to stay . after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale of these type of item .
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer , but to me , songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here , along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level . i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit - that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength . this album is more like day in the life ditty . to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper . a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this ( all original ) and which caught me fully first time through . you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle . crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection .
0	the background is not a background ! you can listen the kid singing
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music . i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment . i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition . hey ry , stick to music for everyone .
1	. but not the people that sold it to me . it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front . very disappointed . : (
0	i never ordered this . i hope it wa free .
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music . most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it . i do .
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
1	this is an absolute classic . it brings me back to the day when michael wa but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
1	a damn awesome song .
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing . best of all , why should i be scared of you ? is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more . dig it .
0	you can tell this is not an original , buy the dubbing and sound quality . i have and original jim stafford album from the 70 and this is not the same ouality of sound . suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england ,
1	what a great song !
1	tragically , it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world , the great natalie cole . but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie , is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart . something that many of her diva like rihanna , beyonc , britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all . instead , they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone . natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the 80 , that nearly derailed her career and her life . in the 90 , she made peace with the passing of her beloved father , nat king cole , and went into jazz music , after year of r & b . but she had some great song for everyone alone . a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end . she flexed her sweet , and beautiful voice in the movie track , with the same title name from 1997. it is a lovely song , and i think of this song from natalie , a one of her best in her lifetime . it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love . i miss natalie so much , but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice , with a deep heart . natalie cole : 1950-2015 song : b+
0	i love this song , but the amazon music app will not play it or save it to my phone .
0	very old school , but wa looking for the song for a frend
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video . i did not like the rap in the middle , did not seem to fit the song .
0	i agree with eric , who reviewed this cd , like him i find this cd not too attractive . other than the hit song heard it all before , sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album . the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor , which could be labeled a light cuisine . a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good . i would not dare to compare her to kelly price , she might have a potential , but she is still got a long way to go to get there .
1	exactly what i wa hoping for ! heard the title song , you+me , and love that sound . lucky for me all the song sound just a good . listen to it everyday .
0	every now and then , great artist miss the target . queen had hot space van halen had vh iii this is on that scale of bad . it is sing songy long boring choral moment . it is melodramatic story telling . it is the greatest collection of technically gifted artist playing simple uninteresting part . do you remember asia ? yeah it is that bad .
0	this 1981 recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me , one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest , silliest , and corniest the label ha to offer in new york ( with the exception of the three song i already mentioned . ) this recording wa of course , an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune . the problem here , aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived , is that the three african song ( 1 , 2 , & 4 singed in african dialect and in french ) are totally uneventful , bland , uninspiring , linear , unvaried , monotonous and totally pointless ! . there is nothing happening ! . laba sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising , and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid-back tropical beach feel with a little electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerve ! . the 1st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo ! . it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to , and encourages them to dance it even further ! . song . 2 feature a chorus a long , a annoying and a insipid a : in coc , in coc , in coc de ba saaah , de ba saaah , de ba saaah all the way through till the end ! . other than that , we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique , curacao , ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut ( whatever that mean ! ) and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach ! he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too ! . ( while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth , this is really a bad a it get . ) for song . 4 , i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality , but which still come out pretty well coming from him . the reason why i decided to review this recording ( now that it ha been available under mp3 downloads since the 5th of august 2008 ) is to tell you to download the great 3. maracaibo oriental , the nice 6. pelta ( written by miguel matamros ) and maybe song . 5 anichayi which aint gon na change your world , but which is decent enough not to be skipped ( or bought for just $ 0.89 on mp3 downloads . ) even though this label wa mainly run by african associate ( a pianist alfredo valds jr. explained on his fascinating interview : the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section [ . ] ) i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly , or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality ! i would say each to their own thing ! . therefore , the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competences/knowledge to do it ! i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be ! finally , there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in 1982 , and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one ! there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental , overall the album doe show better with a big hit : diamoul maw , 2 rock-solid cuban tune which also happen to be song . 3 and 6 , and apparently another hit being song . 5 aminata . i would not dare risking recommend it to you all , but check it out anyway & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/laba-sosseh/dp/b001esgx6w/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > laba sosseh < /a > . song . 3 maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno-descrga tune ! it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr. that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end ! . there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate , outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago , amazing 2-trumpets/1-trombone horn arrangement , a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement ! . everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here ! . [ * descrga in latin music term mean jam-session . ] song . 6 pelta ( most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros ) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk . otherwise , the tune is very pleasant , fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement , a tres-guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end . the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta ! [ meaning jerk in spanish slang ] . basically , a simple and great tune ! . for song . 5 ( which is a decent enough son-montno tune ) , i will let you lot take the punt . sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine , but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago , and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those 2 song ! . my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long , lacked melody and were unexciting too .
1	i saw ruben win on american idol , love his singing .
0	ok
1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again . she is back and this album outshines believe . cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful voice to send these song through the roof . song for the lonely will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today . alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible . when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track . people - buy this album . let u put cher at number 1 again where she belongs !
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan . i own all of their previous album . therefore , i wa all excited for this album to come out , even though , i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait . i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better . they are not ! i would/will not waste any money on this album . it is a very big disappointment , especially judging it based on their previous work . they can and should be putting out better work than this .
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here . been a slipknot fan since the beginning . all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree . but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion . it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal . most cd grow on ya a time go . but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clip in a song or two . that is because these song are all over the place . they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start . the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them . i do not agree with those saying this is iowa 2.0. this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer . skip this chapter .
1	one of conways sexy song .
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you , but it is just an instrumental version of the song . it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything . i wish i had known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want .
1	great album wet dream , and hello are definitely stand out song for me . hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja-rule day back where mc were willing to sing their own hook and i think j. cole doe it well on the track he doe it .
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i.e . passenger . it is not and wasnt worth keeping . i tossed it in the trash . what a waste of $

1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of u .
0	i purchased the mp3 but could not download it . i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again . it doe not work and all the thing they told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to contacting them . they were no help and i am out .99 ( big deal ) but still have no song .
0	i downloaded it .
1	yes ! yes ! yes !
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned 6. she love it . we listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip . it brought me to tear to hear the old song that shaped my spirituality when i wa young , and i am so thrilled i can share it with my daughter .
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who follow christ . i wa hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party , but can not , it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric . if i would have heard the word of the song before i bought it , i would have not .
0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case ! i am livid !
0	it ok but not iggys best
0	just do not like it , i took it just to check it out and i found out i do not like it .
1	always liked simon & garfunkel .
0	i downloaded this song because it wa free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
0	not such a great cd . only one selection meet my expectation .
1	bought this before going to see the show . well done . the show wa awesome ! looking forward to reliving the show with this cd . came with a digital copy via amazon musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise . the cd is new and work great too .
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral . and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion .
1	great song !
1	heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song . brought back memory when i wa younger .
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
1	my wedding song thirty-two year ago
0	rip teleka . this man took your life . i am sorry that people think he some kind of god . but your god will bring you justice someday !
1	even switchfoots b-sides are amazing ! any fan would love this ep
1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever . the movie is great , and so is the soundtrack . kevin spacey doe a great job all around !
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument . undoubtedly , sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra , the london classical player , are a highlight of this recording . the music is played with precision , a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically . what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the 5th symphony , which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording . norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work - his interpretation of beethoven 2nd and 8th symphony are , in some way , his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle . i listened to the 5th yesterday , when i wa feeling very low , and it put me in a much better frame of mind . we all need music like this sometimes . i have needed it a lot lately . sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having . i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it . modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous , heavy and stodgy . a recording for people who like fresh , crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar , washed down with chilled chardonnay , and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat , stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table !
1	louie prima and keely smith , the king and queen of the 50 vega lounge circuit . included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in just one of those thing .
1	yeah buffett .
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co-writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception . however , unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album , this song is not very magical . in fact , it fall flat on the floor . the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time . the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to . sorry , lenny . maybe next time ! 2 star . end note : at least he still look good though . i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt , and le clich and boring . this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic .
1	i did not like it at first . after listening to it a few time , i got it . it is beautiful . lanny is a musical genius .
1	phenomenal !
1	classic redman . glad to see him back
0	i love him , not a much a he doe , but i have enjoyed all his music to this point . you can find song like this on any album in the genre , nothing wa added to the music world from this album .
1	beautifully written and sung . a song to listen to over and over . sound quality is good especially with headphone , oh yeahhhh .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	always a classic song . great quality , too .
0	i did not like it because i wa looking for lp not single . anyways , i sent it back and i wa quickly processed for money return . it wa needing more information on the add .
0	just get yourselves an exocist !
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album . i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them . so i will not spend the money to buy the entire album . when this song is available to download individually , let me know and you just might get a sale .
0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa . wasnt the seller fault .
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa ! maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again . i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year ! i feel ripped off and so disappointed !
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument . everybody think it wa korn , but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage . you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn , nickelback , and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the 1990s . almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana- monotone vocal that explode into raging scream , wall of distorted guitar noise , and whiney lyric about how miserable life is . do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll ? nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing . nirvana were not about music . they were about conformity and nothing more . just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable , immature , whiney suburban teenager from their money . they were the backstreet boy with guitar , basically . the linkin park of 88-94. i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last decade .
0	wack
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret , or even fire garden . but gospel and blue type singing ? . kind of a turn off . i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album . and that hurt to say .
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor : when i first heard her 4 or 5 year ago , i thought , wow ! she is really unique and awesome ! . then came her next record and i thought . hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it . she ha managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight record . i think that is a record or something ( pun intended ) . i just want to tell her , yea , we have got it , you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million time for effect .
0	if it where possible , i would leave zero star ! one of the worst album i have ever purchased .
1	wonderful old song - not covered enough at all .
1	good song .

1	i have never been a huge death cab fan , but i love this new song . it modern , clean , and just a great song . if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album , i think it going to be great .
0	i think it is so good message is great i just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star .
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flutist that i wa looking for . i wa very disappointed that it wa not !
0	i can not rate this ! it did not open for me . i am unable to open or hear this song . how can i make it open in mp3 form ? help
0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd . what a waste of money . could these song be sung any slower ? very disapointed . l
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back . his version is amazing . if you buy his version through february , proceeds go to charity ! if you buy this version , you will be supporting glee , who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit . no , thank you !
0	product sucked got it and it skip very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad .
0	what a rip off of katy perry . wow ! how no one ha noticed is unbelievable !
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. really take me back to that time , really good song .
0	if yo listen to the lyric , terrible ! nice , pop melody though which is probably why it is so popular .
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the great sousa ! a must buy for any march lover !
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life , including a year in vietnam . i used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little . but . . .i really do not think ten new song is all that great . i am glad someone gave it to me , tho .
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra , with mary martin doing the singing . that is the plus , a it is always a pleasure to hear her . why should not i is the third standard ( or maybe it is an almost standard ) from cole porter jubilee , and definitely a favorite song of mine . this is a very good straight version , without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it . the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse , which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric ( e.g . i must find some kind persona grata , to give me data , personally ) . for that reason , i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song .
0	please get it off my kindle i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough those of u with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of .
0	disappointed . poor subject matter , poor quality .
0	the version of the song is not my favorite . unfortunately , i think this is the only version released . i even tried to find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	perfect . a described . thank you
1	jojos voice is truly gifted ! she ha comeback with great force and can not wait for further music from her in the future ! this tringle is great !
0	the whole mp3 is just noise , not good noise , not even a lot of noise but noise . what a bunch of hooey . do not click on this one . the only reason i wa looking wa i tried steve g. jones and in two night have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choice when eating . it is also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep . but this one - boo hiss stay away . glad i only wasted $ .99 . whew .
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd . a a collector of original cast album of flop musical , i regretfully bought that cd . it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album . the insert came straight off of a computer printer , the first band wa silent ( the actual recording started on the second band ) leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement . hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range .
1	love this song !
1	classic al stuff . in his usual humorous style . early in al album every song is great .
0	bought by mistake . not among kelly best ( check out ne-yos song of the same name ) .
0	think i deserve my money back . this song wa labeled a clean , yet upon playing the entire song , there are several profane word . wasted my money because i can not listen to it .
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ! ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song ! keep up the good work
0	mostly instrumental .
0	sorry @ the head and the heart but i just do not get it . i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money .
1	at the age of 66 and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much . i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her . this wa one of those song . in all there wa 11 song that i picked out . i will have to tell you is wa some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it wa more then worth it . after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level . so if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that express your love for her .
1	stylistically , i love all type of music . but , how do i classify fireflights album , for those who wait album - is it indie , is it rock - i do not know ? but , what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work ! drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band - with fireflight , there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person - and , the driving vocal of pat benatar , and pop musicality of the go-gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs . ( thanks , pooh for the great word , smackerl , you silly ole bear ) . yet , although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular-bands-of-yore-oh-so-great in fireflights unique sound - i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh - and dare i say anointed ? check out the band website - [ . ] . they have their video available for your viewing pleasure . there is a genuine story being told in each song - i assure you .
0	did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a 50th class reunion power point presentation .
0	i love the original video recording , but this version add way to much instrument background music . make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song .
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music . it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star ( no danse macabre , and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete - just one part from each season ) . but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist . i highly recommend it !
0	something my pocket purchased and played
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber . this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way , and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother . very inspirational !
0	pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd . forgettable .
0	i am not a music critic , i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for . i can simply say i did not enjoy the album . one , maybe 2 good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list . i hope they , zac brown band , plan to get back to country again soon . still listening to all of their other album daily .
1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
0	definitely need to be remastered .
1	love it , great song .
0	not impressed
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel , the da song soon ! and narration by chuck smith . really , if you have shotgun angel , there is little reason to buy this . if you do not have shotgun angel , get it instead . if you are buying this for the song soon ! ( which is the weakest song on it ) get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead . if you are buying this for the narration , it is not worth it . i can not criticize the biblical passage , though not particularly well read ; but the interpretive part is not well done . i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement , but i knew this would be the case before buying the album ; i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile - and it would have , had i not already had all the song . the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision . i really felt like only giving this one star , but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for , were they not better found in their original context ( shotgun angel ) .
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship . it is not cry , but mere acceptance of the inevitable . toni braxton sound beautiful in it .
0	quality of recording is not perfect ? * %
0	love the song but this version is barely audible . hello , it is rock , where is the volume .
0	i very rarely bother to write a review , unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something . unfortunately this is the latter . i have always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak , materialistic , egotistical , club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 year now . though every album ha had a different feel to it , i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.this album is slowwwwwed down . tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music . not everything ha to be 300 mile per hour of awesomeness , but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either . the dj wa completely uninspired . i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist . usually a complex mixture of big brass , synthesizer , different time signature , other genre of music thrown in , and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around , this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music . the lyric are amazing a usual , you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album ( the only reason i am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 ) dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd.most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good , then slows down horrifically for the last two parts.there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album.the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n9ne cd . sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system . not the reason i buy tech n9ne . if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays . like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time . he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo . i am sure it will sell well . i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n9ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again .
0	the song is fine , but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro , like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny .
1	zac and the band are awesome
0	wow . a christmas album featuring a rhodes ! ? i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room , so i wa elated to see this cd . but it is not played on a rhodes . it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard , complete with cheezy drum track . it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano . what a disappointment . all the song are very stiff , a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live . i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title .
1	love this song !
0	very disapointing , sound like it is playing to slow . obvisouly a recording problem .
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness ! do i really need to say anything ? if your a jimi fan , buy it and listen !
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round . it is so soothing , yet intense at the same time . the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece . i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful , graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent .
0	too much fuzz not enough fan .
0	art garfunkel ? his version wa much better , more relaxed , and much smoother . i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr. grobans range .
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to . 1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to .
1	awesome cd . listen all the way through .
1	great inspirational music .
1	i like listening to demi lavatos music . she is pretty good . i bought it for my kindle fire hd . you should like it too .
0	this should be a lot better . however it is not . do not waste your money . sorry brian
1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70 . other hit song by them were hey , nineteen , rikki do not lose that number , deacon blue and do it again .
1	this is a good track from my teen year . it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood . i have not heard any of their other music , but this is a good track to get ; )
1	i love this album ! a very anointed project !
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol , boring !
0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to alexa
1	i love his music and message
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1 ? mr. big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit . he is so emotional . it must be from the bottom of his heart
1	the story wa good . the music wa so so . we hail from new jersey . and grew up listening to the four season . we used to follow them intensely . wherever they were appearing . we know their sound . the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong . he wa singing to falsetto . you know over doing . this is our opinion , but then again we are jersey girl !
1	like steampunk ? well , this is electro-swing - and about half of the electro-swing album i find , i would call steampunk themed music . caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro-swing album that i have found . i highly recomend it . be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that is what i like about it ( it make it a bit more timeless ) . it is fantastic for driving , or background music at party . enjoy !
0	if i wa having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in anytown , usa and this came on mid movement , i would committ hari kari . it is that terrible . this make shania twain sound like mozart .
1	well it is wreckx-n-effect . what more need to be said . mr teddy riley did it yet again . with this group made up of his brother & cousin he killed the 90
1	what is there not to like with billy currington . i excercise to must of done something right . easy slow so start with stretching then upper body movement . i have arthritis . so this is great for me .
1	very good centering music to maintain balance .
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy .
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast , bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word . can not wait for the album .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
0	. the mp3 is of bad quality . be wary of downloading amazon southern gospel mp3s . i have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad lp or something . edit : my mp3 skipping problem wa traced back to my dial-up connection . be sure to download amazon mp3s via broadband for best music quality .
0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album , which i think is great ! this one did not deliver like that one for me but i am still listening to it . i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening . usually for me when an album doe not hit me right away , it will a little later , well see .
1	love them
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. you are husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
0	very frustrating ! you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song . unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy , from the same band doing the same song , only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it ! wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than 20 second long in a part of the song that might be helpful ! or provide info that more clearly say , recent re- recording !
1	jackies voice ha really matured . a other reviewer have said and i agree with , this is hauntingly beautiful . this being the first single from her new album , i really can not wait to hear the other song from the album .
1	a
1	he is a young george straight . nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music . i hope he ha a great career .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
0	the song is great . but , this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song , making it impossible for me to listen to .
0	what a lazy production from pink floyd a it is supposed last album . very disappointed .
0	i have been a big boc fan since the 1970s , and have gotten most of their album along the way , but imaginos wa one that got away from me . i have seen many online comment about how great it is , and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction . so , when this reissue wa released , i had to pick it up . well . it really doe not do it for me , i am afraid . the problem is that , first of all , it doe not sound like a boc album , and , a i recently discovered , it is not . it is a solo album by bocs drummer , albert bouchard , and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera . despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger , the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another . the rather pointless re-do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with . and if you are going to call this a boc album , you have got ta have buck dharma , who get short shrift here . the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album , apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own . the album is not a total disaster ( i kind of like the baron frankenstein number ) , but i am very glad that i did not pay $ 100.00 for it on ebay ! i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja , and hope to see that happen sometime soon . ( p 07/27/08 : club ninja is coming soon ! )
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far ! can not wait to hear the rest of their album . the boy are awesome and so talented !
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the 90 and 2000s . these song are a great mix of catchy tune , fun lyric , and biblical truth . furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together . the highlight of the album for me is it is alright ( for lazarus ) . i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry . it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death . a few other highlight for me include shame , right wrong girl , and dare i say . truthfully , i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music . it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio .
0	i like the cd or better said , prince music . my problem is the packaging is crap . i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out . the cd snapped like a potato chip . seriously . product quality mean everything , not just the music .
1	grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled time it is no suprise . but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love . the theme song deputy this in a haunting way .
1	best cd i bought in a year . i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing .
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame a rape victim
1	awesome value ! this is a great mix of classic christmas tune , instrumental and vocal , and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party . for $ .99 there is no better value .
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode . then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song . i wa sold . that wa when i decided to purchase this song . she reminds me of a japanese shakira . the donde estan los ladrones shakira : soulful , gritty , heart-thread tugging , soul speaking singer .
0	i am sorry , i hate to be rude or insensitive . people like what they like i know , however , i have to say that this is the worst song ever ! the fact that ne-yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe . the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard . i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous , horrible lyric and nasally singing . how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once . the first time is enough torture , seriously ! the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good ! it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up . i like ne-yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired . this song suck badly ! i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h_ll this crap could be called music . many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it !
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak , however , not stating this is 45 second long is almost misrepresenting itself . in fact , it is . listen to the free clip - you have heard 70 % of the interview . shame on you , amazon !
1	love the song it is so uplifting and i play it three or four time a day just to get moving !
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album . monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement .
1	i love bronn journey harp music . thanks .
0	i am from mxico . i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality , too much surface noise and not very good sound . i decided not to get the next one . but when my favorite maiden album ( this one and 7th son ) came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity . i have to say it wa the same disappointment . they do not even sound nearly a my 80 uk edition . whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection . i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl . too much surface noise and tick and pop . please , if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl .
1	i think that 50 cent newest cd get rich or die tryin is great . he is the hottest thing on the street right now . everyone is bumppin 50. get rich or die tryin got alot of cameo and it sound great it better than ja rule ! haha
1	lady gaga - cheer to you darling , this song is fabulous ! i highly recommend you buy it . i did and i will never regret it . this is a song you can listen to over and over again . wonderful ! : )
1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier . watch the speed a it is easy to get lost in the music .
1	wonderful song ! great lyric and a really catchy tune . you will be singing this one even when it is not playing : ) let love explode and bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is surely alive he is living on the inside roaring like a lion !
1	nice
1	lov it
0	did not like the song at all . i remove it from my download . very disappointed in the way it is song and the music .
1	this song is awesome . i am not a huge fan of three day grace , but this is by far my favorite .
0	i went through day of singing this over and over .
1	fun song , love it
0	i want a new online music store , i want a new music store , one that do not just sell mp3s , one that will sell me original cd quality downloads , one that will take the time to respect the music , one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should . seriously bought one single just to test it out , cause i do not want to pay $ 40 , for the original cd ( reprint ) . i am not a audio snob , but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup . i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format . i would gladly pay an extra $ 5 dollar or whatever for wav handling , i do not think this is too much to ask . amazon or itunes can not seem to comprehend this .
0	after a couple of day , song refused to play . had to download from another server .
1	beautiful !
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
1	i wa happy to see that this track wa offered for sale , a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd . i feel that , with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording , this is the best recording of the show out there .
1	it is pure pink .
1	great song ! band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well ! recommend to people who like heavy metal , just not cookie monster metal !
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music . that is what i consider this . along with the postal service , music to fall asleep to .
0	it is ok
0	basically my sister ( 16 year old ) is listening to this garbage in the other room , and it is aggravating ; i do not like shopping at the mall , and this music is teleporting me there . it is the definition of insipid , and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy , and thus spending dough . in other word , this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience . it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though . to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small , and the world at large . anyone who like this doe not like music , but i would not know , i do not like music either-i like mogwai-good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock . for if it dunnae rock ti piss
0	i absolutely love this song ! however , the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible . it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it . it did only cost $ .25 so i guess i will live with it .
1	dark , but great song . and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar . liked it , good value for the price and convienient to download . i love amazon .
0	great song !
1	you have to consider , though , that music of this kind sort of play itself , and a far a i am concerned , the organist must just not get in the way of it . walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue , which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard , and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned . towards the end , i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed , still keeping within a modest forte . because there are no extreme of dynamic , i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car , where extreme softs and louds are problematic . ( modern equipment can do compression , which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car , so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration . ) bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy , but it hold up beautifully . i recommend it , and the entire set .
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance . doe not mesh well with the other instrument . need a lot of work .
0	to small
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd . wish i would have listened to it first . not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me . there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to . maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me . it just blew me away right from the start . oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better .
1	heard this song on the radio a few time and loved it . when i finally found out the name , i bought . it is cute and catchy , preview it and see ( hear ) for yourself = )
1	love bfs ! and they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are . again ! the bitch song ha always been a favorite of mine . and i am so excited to see it back on the track list ! it is great hearing that song . new and musically improved ! : ) stacys mom just make me laugh . because for some weird reason people have thought that they have been singing it for year . and now all of those people are correct haha . and i have never done anything like this is just typical bfs stuff ! love it ! good good stuff ! : )
0	despite this being a label album , it really just another flame album . v rose only get one track to herself , and it the forgettable threw it all away . ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference , the label ha stuck with their two artist . yes , a lot of various artist from reach record , cross movement , and beyond are brought in to add flavor , but it flame project without question . and it ok , but it not a good a flame usual stuff , which ha been declining a of late in my opinion . i am kinda disappointed , a the guest did not shine particularly bright either , so i will give it a 2 , maybe a 2.5 no knock on the message , thats great . but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall .
1	great music . very inspirational .
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place . have yet to open the case because it is a gift , but hopefully it is ok .
0	i do not understand how this album won award . i would ask for my money back if i could .
0	got a free download for purchasing cd from amazon . tried to download , but wa not successful . tech support from amazon non-existent . i am sure it wa opperator error , but they only give you one chance . i have let other free download offer expire . not worth the hassle . love billy joel , have album , cassette , and cd .
0	love the band , but there only one good song on this release . seriously , anything that say feat . in it is passe and unoriginal . if you are so good , why do you need help ? it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together , and now everyone is doing it . seriously , keep the dj out . none of the good one know wtf they are doing . i will pas on this one . collide is much better , and 13 song at that .
1	this is terry fator . what more can you ask for ? a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan .
0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past . the word of god renews my spirit daily !
1	great
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week . deftones is one of my favorite band .
1	i like this song there is not a lot i can say other than i like it and so do my friend

0	i downloaded this track by accident . this is the live version of the song . i wanted the original studio version .
1	terrific !
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube . loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep . had one of the best sleep in a long time . maybe it wa a one off , but this wa encouraging . time will tell .
0	his vocal are too modern country . the song are depressing and mundane . they are all too similar . it just go on for too long .
0	of all the song to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track , this one about the worst you could pick . i previewed some of her other track . not great . but definitely not a bad a this track . i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one . not good .
0	not too sure about this one !
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day . but let u face it , back in the day he wa in his twenty . keith is almost 50 year old now and still singing that teenage music . it is time for him to sing some grown up song . his title and lyric are so immature for his age . his voice still sound nice , but he need to grow the heck up ! to his credit , he look fine a hell on his new cd cover , very mature looking for someone so immature !
0	no rocky top ? ! ? why bother ? that is like warm beer & cold pizza , close but not quite .
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie , but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother . this audio encounter is not by the mayles , and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party . the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck . the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive . i do not know the timing of this production but big edie ( mum ) doe not seem to take part at all . the appeal of little edie had always been her expression , body language , and refreshing vocal ; this production did not stimulate at all , and wa frankly a little humdrum .
1	love it .
1	great song
1	this is my favorite version of valerie : it ha personality , class , great performing style . oh , it is beautiful . i realy wish that it would be her signature song , not the i am not going to rehab , ( no , no , no , ) one .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
0	i wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not .
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon-to-be christmas classic ! well done , p-unit !
0	i really did not find any of it funny , not a single redeeming quality to be found . usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at . not the case with this one , it is just devoid of charm or humor . it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea . i wish i could un-listen to it , do not waste your time .
1	love it .
0	ok
0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 piece . mine only downloaded 100 .
1	-incredible scream -great melodic breakdown -incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is . you can tell this band doe their own thing/has their own style and doe not conform . that is what make them great . con : album is a little too short , some of the song sound similar
0	low sound quality . i deleted .
1	cool !
0	one song for $ 9.99 ? i guess it is my fault that i did not read the product description , but i wa under the impression , for that price , that i wa getting a full length cd .
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me . how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric ? better songwriting is definitely in order .
0	not my kind of music , downloaded them for a funeral
1	love it , fun dance song
0	very disappointed in this cd . it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song , too annoying to listen too .
1	love this song
1	louisville represent . love supporting artist from my home state . laid back soul . you got ta listen to this .
1	i could not wait for bruno to drop his new album . i love his style . i grew up listening to different genre of music . my mom wa r & b . dad loved funk/soul and all true 80 baby should love new jack swing . he wa able to incorporate all of it on 1 album . hand down a masterpiece . whole album on repeat .
1	this wa a well received gift . can not go wrong with john lennon anything .
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube . beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound . plus i love the disco beat . little known now and little info about them anymore . they were popular in europe in the early 80 . i think they were english but played a lot in germany . do not think they did much in the u .
0	for the elevator or dentist office . i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here . but i wa a big fan . and yes , i gave the cd several try , all the way through . even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album . it is just milk toast . dull , uninspired and uninspiring . sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm ( really ? ) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out , and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off . yes , mumfords voice is gorgeous , but not enough to save the album . hey , fame and fortune is tough , but they made it through 27. i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited .
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in . not good to work out to .
0	i do not think anyone over the age of 16 like ( or can relate to ) nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed ( playing gig in a band doe not count ) . once you become become of that age , the most important thing are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school . clearly , the people here are the pre-teen target audience . look at the misspelling , look at the abbreviation of even simple word , and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves . they would do anything for kurdt and are easily-lead . just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it . if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day , would you enjoy that ? same concept with these song . people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment . just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it .
1	come on it is led zeppelin : d
0	7 second of what , the hunger game intro ? do not get this download . you will regret it . need i say more .
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be . a lot of the song i have never heard before .
0	would not download . error in file name .
1	love this song , reminiscent of grover washington jr. great style and warmth .
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and 2001 album - this is not it . i do not feel that this is a dr. dre album since he is not the predominant rapper , but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre . there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one . maybe he should have made detox all along . oh well .
0	disappointed . nothing like their first track .
1	good song
0	ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information . wa not like the picture . returned 1st one and ordered a second which wa identical to the first . also wa returned .
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
0	sanjaya wa entertaining on idol . but he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy . this song is terrible ! off-key warbling , non-melodic , soulless . pas this up asap !

1	great
1	my 14 month old baby love this song . quality is great . i wanted exactly same sinsong , singed by same singer etc . and i think this is it !
0	i love ne-yo but this album wasnt what i expected
1	always have been a journey fan
1	with their sophmore album , lifehouse ha defenitely improved . their sound ha matured and become so much better ( not that no name face wa bad ) . the album first single , spin , is very energetic and uplifting ( and the video made me dizzy ) . a few other track to note are anchor , which is a powerful song , am i ever gon na find out , which is incredibly catchy , take me away , another very powerful one , and the beginning , which is beautiful enough to make me cry . lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall . i strongly recommend it .
0	a much a i really wanted this to work , it absolutely did not ! the voice is irritating rather than soothing . the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective . a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better . considering all of the experience this guy ha , i expected so much better . do not buy it , it is a waste of your money .
1	fabulous music , love the violin and the piano in the background . the music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me . one of the best cd ever !
1	i lost this song from my mp3 album . i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me . this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago .
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation . check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion .
1	when the name van mccoy come up , if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late 1970s , it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle . mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to # 1 on the billboard hot 100 in 1975 , and wa billboard # 22 most popular song of that year . fast forward a year to 1976 , where mccoy released another song with a similar , albeit lighter sound , called the shuffle . though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial ( and maybe it got used that way at some point ) , it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music . i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song , but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go . if you do , perhaps you will clue u in !
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap . i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted . it wa adverized a being sold on amazon . i decided to buy it . so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon . but it wa not the same version ! only one verse wa in english . i felt extremely disappointed ! i wanted the english version so very much . but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what i wa led to believe i wa buying : the english version of veni sante spiritus ! do not be fooled !
0	problem with amazon music
1	for country music fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the music of schuyler , knobloch and overstreet , judy rodman , and schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt , this cd is a must for your collection . this cd cover most of the major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd . judy rodman , who wa a minor success ( and mtm record only artist before folding ) in the early to mid 80 ha several of her best known hit on this release . from the up tempo girl ride horse too to the memory laced until i met you , these two song are just a few of the hard to find gem on any cd of any type . i wa absolutely estatic to find the schuyler , knobloch and overstreet song you can not stop love in this collection . this is a song that i have searched for on cd for 3 year . this cd also ha rarity from the girl next door ( slow boat to china ) , schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt ( baby got a new baby ) , and two becky hobbs selection ( jones on the jukebox , they always look better when they are leavin ) . if you are searching for these obscure recording on cd , this offering will not disappoint you .
1	this band is so good ! there last album wa good . this one is even better !
1	this is great sound and pink is good in everything that she sings . if you love this like i do get all of her music .
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through .
1	i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better . the lyric , vocal , instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen .
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement . always disappointing . be forewarned . it wa revealed in very small print .
0	love the song . hate the download process through amazon . i do not want your player amazon . you made the normal download link to small , like fine print . took me too long to figure out . made me grouchy .
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack , never in my life . never thought i would , for that matter . but , after watching tron : legacy , i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie , but i loved the music ! it is amazing , a this review title say . : ) i usually always have playing on my mp3 player thousand foot krutch and fm static , my favorite band . so i thought it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff ( since tfk is hard rock ) , but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning . i would definitely recommend this album . get the whole thing . it rule . and , btw , i am becoming a very big tron fan , thanks to this awesome cd ! and i watched the first tron , and i really really enjoyed that one . i think everyone need to watch that one if they have seen , or are going to see , the second one , because it really help to understand it all . thank you all you tron people !
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file . i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file/windows medium of my pc . now i can not load the song onto my android phone . i tried over and over again . the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer . will someone call or email me and straighten this out .
0	only got this for a friend .
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download . i absolutely love this song , it ha good sound quality , but they cut off the entire last word/note ! it drive me crazy and really ruin the track .
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new york : big sophisticated city image .
1	love this song !
1	her usual perfect music . love it .
1	some of my favorite music from back in the 80 . brings back so many wonderful memory ! the cd arrived in perfect condition !
0	did not like this version of his . i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back-up singer . oh well .
1	rip
0	yuck
1	this wa a pretty good album , i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs ( that still belongs to to the pain ) , but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band , i would like to see them do more solo though . pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor , my two personal favorite on the album were pin & needle and never cared before .
0	great song , but the download version is only 128kbps . why is no higher quality version available ?
1	great song better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season 1
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer .
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the original artist it wa a big scam it wa a remake by some artist i never heard of
0	this is not the original version .
0	censored version , but it had the explicit label
1	this song came out in the 90 and i remember having this cd at the time . this wa one of their big hit along with i want u. i love this song because the group came along with a new sound . they were in when grunge rock ruled , but along come savage garden , what a blessing . the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric , i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic , 80 , an 90 . a great band for those of u who whated something besides those grunge band . kris l. cockayne
1	attunement is a true miracle . a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid , spectacular sound . those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed . but in the lens of dembys all-encompassing camera obscura , attunement range from the raw , sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus . the texture are constantly changing , like the color and fragrance of a secret garden . you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before . such is the power of attunement . this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition ( spontaneous combustion ? . it doe smoke at time . the fire from the earth inner core ) a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure !
0	it sounded good on the clip . after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be .
1	love it
0	come on . it is christmas . really ? did she really have to make a vulgar song ? she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday ? it is the season of hope and joy , yet lady gaga is producing this . i have never had a problem with her other work . up until now that is . and to top it all off , amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion .
0	poor
1	incredible musical talent and so inspirational ! love love love it !
1	sound like old school veruca salt . recommended .
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome .
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort . i find it boring . i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only 2 or 3 likable song out of 14. that is not what i wanted . i wanted 6-8 track that were very good not just 2-3. of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer . but this difference is sound went the wrong way . everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it . i have listend to this album 6 or 7 time and still am not too thrilled . brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened . i hope the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed .
0	i downloaded it thinking that i could use it and hear it . it wa lost in my harddrive somewhere and now i just wasted a $ 1.00
1	there were a couple of top 40 song from this album , but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound .
1	great song , long length . thought provoking . brings back good memory from the 90 . you will ask yourself . where wa i when i heard that ?
1	awesome song !
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for . not much to say about a music mp3
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song , it is a little different but it is okay
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite . his first three album are off the chart . but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop . what a bad album . ive waited this long for this . i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound . he need a producer , some one to make dope beat . this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it . im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more . at least the wu keep it real . built for cuban link 2 wa great . reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music ?
1	love this song . start my day out with it .
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago ; considering the book came out in 1993 , i wa so happy to find the music in cd format . because i know the story behind the music , i do not know if the music would stand alone . it is gorgeous , ha a variety of flavor to it . it sound like song from a musical . i would recommend getting both the book and the cd . the book is not a picture book , per se , but a story with illustration . the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone . storyline : a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident . the relative is an older aunt , an anthropologist , living in the outback . she share a story with her niece . so the story within the story is the creation of the earth : when the earth wa ready to be born [ ancient ancestor ] stretched and yawned . and began to roam the planet . a they did , they sang , and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence . when they were done , there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth , sun and moon and star to find out what she really is . the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody , and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia .
0	problem is not the music . but they apparently sent u a blank . four different cd player and not a one can read it . holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track .
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want . amazon . a little warning next time please . i still cant find the song i did order . anybody can help with this ? im going in circle here . secondly , the song wa annoying at first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy . cross between old beatles music and alternative rock . least it not filled with suicide , violence and cursing . i will be looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo , not a bad idea . agaion , amazon , a little warning next time before you just dump something on them . you need to make your uploading process easier . this is getting to be too much work for too little . i may stick to itunes
1	thank you
1	like it
0	i am so disappointed in the last 3 i bought b/c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song , rearranged or in a different language . this is very poor representation especially for a new group . whoever made those decision should be fired . their objective should b to make new follower , not loose them . i have purchased 15 dvd a present and 2 new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label .
0	ordered and paid for 3 song . only one song down loaded . amazon site said all 3 were down loaded . my e-mail to them for help wa never answered . customer service suck !
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your private chopped off . thats all i have to say , no 50 cent , it is not my birthday , and we are not gon na party like it my birthday , especially not to your crappy music . have a nice day
0	this is not the full song , it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration . i actually want my money back . do not buy !
1	wonderful music , a always by josh groban .
0	from [ . ] , dated august 17 , 2008 : the compilation album a closer end , that recently started appearing on the p2p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store , is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg . it is very convincingly made , with a century medium logo , fake barcode and extensive booklet , but it is nevertheless a bootleg . it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing , but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not , and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography , presented a a legitimate release , we feel the need to set the record straight .
0	too sad . must be a liberal
1	this is a good song do not wa easy to download with no problem at all sure the album is good
0	package wa sent back originally because it wa too damaged . i had to re-order the product and when i received it the case wa severely damaged any ] way .
1	the star say it all , do not know what else i could put other than i love it .
1	keeping it real .
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the 70 , but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame . amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music . who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd ?
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead . even worse , they might mistake it for the original . collection like this need more one-star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them .
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and did not want to buy an album with a bunch of music i did not want .
0	meh , not my type i guess .
1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year . i really enjoyed listening to it . more than once .
1	great song . i had no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter !
0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album . though i do not prefer spanish singing , some song are nicely done . but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous 2 duet album . with all the great classic song to pick , why recycle the same song ? i do not get it .
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd . i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand . with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere . i really do not know how to describe how i feel . it is not bad music , it is not a bad album . but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band - i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it . i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford & son - other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have . i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke , this is not going to be one of them . it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because - dare i say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing . i am not going to purchase new - i will wait for used and cheaper . not that i think amazon is asking too much - i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar . sorry mumford & son , the album is ok but not what we really liked you for .
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer . the beat are pretty nice . if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat , that have a very raw/rough feel and sound . the right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal , etc on top . if , however , someone is looking for larger selection of beat , some with music , they could check out heat beat vol 1 by royalty free , then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league , or something like that . hope this help
1	awesome song and it is a timeless classic . i dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley , which you do not know unless you are into the whole post-hardcore movement . apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic-sounding song , so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark . the song keep the lyric , maintaining the dirty feeling of it all , but it turn up the rock , and really make it a rockin song , causing it to end up a really weird , but fun combination for various party . check the song out , and you might find you like it if you are into post-hardcore , modern rock , or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat . who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent ? oh , by the way , i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon . ; )
0	back in the very early 90 , i had this ( the cassette tape version ) and thought it wa amazing . until i bought the cd recently , i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me . it wa almost painful to listen to , and i remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music ! i would only recommend this for laugh or a 90 nostalgia night .
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around the starting line came . they sound exactly like nfg . which is not good either . and there lyric are so boring and lame . if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
1	i love this song ! download wa smooth and simple . burn to disc wa fine . will download more music from amazon .
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic . unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up . i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl , but the seller did list this a good condition yet 90 % of it wa unplayable . very disappointed .
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone . i just love to listen to him sing
0	did not download a expected , emailed amazon , no answer !
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song . it really resonates with the pain i am current healing from . thank you , plumb .
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label . the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin . the singer is brigitte fassbaender . warning regarding fassbaender . in da klangende lied , the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part . but in all the other piece in the two disc , the vocal are more prominent . it is therefore the case that in these other piece , the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most . fassbaenders singing style ( if you want to call it singing ) includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato . this bizarre , exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted , to be a perversion , and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition . when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording , it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed , irritated , and angry . in some kind of music , such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins , or in grindcore music , such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass , the distorted voice is the point of the recording , and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience . but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music . also , fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you . for this reason , i recommend only da klagende lied , but am not able to recommend the other piece on this 2-disc set . the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler , and they consist of da klagende lied , kindertotenlieder , de knaben wunderhorn , lied eines fahrenden gesellen ( all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ) , and ruckert leider ( all five song are here ) . only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation . this review provides a side-by-side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle . the rattle recording is slightly better , for reason disclosed below . this review also provides a side-by-side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn ( the song about the fish ) with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado . the abbado recording is slightly better , for the reason listed below . second-by-second account of waldmarchen . this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied , one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire . waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum . at the 6 second point , the french horn provide a short riff . then , at 18 second , the flute join in . the french horn resume at 23 second , and at 24 second , the reed and string join the fray . at 33 second , the french horn join in again , and here they play a real tune , not just a riff . at 50 second , the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch , and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch . at one minute and 37 second come a momentary crescendo . it is a big crescendo , but there is not any crash of cymbal . these timing are for the rattle recording . this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording , with the nit-picky exception that i list below . the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second , but the rattle recording start with music , not with any hum . comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle . the chailly timing is 28 minute and 8 second , while the rattle timing is 28 minute and 31 second . in the chailly recording , the tenor ( werner hollweg ) make his entrance at 5 min , 36 sec , singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire . mr. hollwegs voice is slightly tinny . in the rattle recording , the tenor ( robert tear ) make his entrance at 5 min , 23 second . robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding , somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff . thus , i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording . for reason unknown to me , the chailly recording ha a tenor ( werner hollweg ) and a bass ( andreas schmidt ) , while in contrast , the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone . the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea . the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann . there is no discernable difference to my ear , in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording . hochzeitsstuck . the chailly recording clock at 18:32 , while the rattle recording is 18:57. the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum , a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass , and blaring brass . this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off-stage band , which is much quieter than the on-stage orchestra . the off-stage band can be heard , for example , in the interval of 2:16 to 3:12. when the off-stage band is playing , the only other source of music is vocal soloist , at least for this interval of time . this movement also feature a chorus preference . for the following reason , i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied . the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume , and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic . in contrast , the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy . also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice , over the tinny voice of hollweg . the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff ( baritone ) and anne sofie von otter ( mezzosoprano ) , a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label . on the chailly recording , there are only three song , a i mentioned above , and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato . in the abbado recording , some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female . my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish , and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no . 2. anyway , this compare the fish song ( de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording . notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at 20-30 second and 60-65 second , and the five second donkey-like braying from clarinet that occurs at 60 second and again at 105 second . the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong . i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason . first of all , the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo . also , in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured , because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute , and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato . the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording . also , the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon , and to my ear , the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording . to reiterate these point , what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound , and the more easily discernable fluttery flute , donkey braying , and mysterious chinese gong . conclusion . the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony . a careful side-by-side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording . i did my own side-by-side comparison , and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado . da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition , and it ha been my favorite since the year 1972. it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old .
0	not only is she a horrible singer . she support cop killer . she is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video . please do not support her !
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased . i will find something better . not worth it .
1	beautiful song
0	dumb
0	ok not what i expected
1	i will always love 3 door down !
0	these guy are terrible .
0	when i bought this dvd i wa expecting to get the famous cali lifestyle 2 dvd . instead i got the audio cd with a small sample of creeper present cali lifestyle 2. the small sample dvd only contains about 4 minute of video footage from creeper cali lifestyle 2 dvd . if you want the full dvd contact cali finest production . you can also buy the full dvd just a long it doe not contain the audio cd . i wa very dissapointed with this purchase .
0	total ripoff ! this is not the whole song , it is like a 30 second sound bite from the song . i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for $ 1.29 . save yourself a buck and do not buy this .
0	just not the same a bon jovi
0	purchased this and it never did show up in my account .
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it .
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive , it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office . one minute you are straining to hear the word , the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down . susan boyle voice is low , almost a mumble , and she sound like a little girl- not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection . i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it .
0	not to much into the hard rock sound .
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station . i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood ( iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station ) . anyhow from my perspective , see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im ready to aim . the music complement the song a well .
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass . this portion is so moving , i can listen to it over and over .
1	the song re-interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them . this might be a christmas album , but the music is not limited to only that time of year .
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie . this album wasnt anything great . i hope the new movie will blow my sock off !
1	love it . ha a bluesy sound .
1	my student ad i love this song and the video that made u go and buy it . it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone !
1	there is just something about him that take me away . he is got this voice that is so unique that talk to your soul .
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap-rock band , in detail . i am not one of those people . for me , this genre is a side dish , not the main course , but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it . new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album , numb : the same anger , the same desperation , the same hard edge . but i think that frontmen tac and hash , while working from this genre , wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance . tac ha stated : . it is a snapshot of our generation right now . the way a lot of u feel in a time of war , technology , pain and love . it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today . i have felt this way , but i have not articulated it , even to myself . abicas lyric reflect this state of affair , and musically they draw on various influence . the main one i notice are linkin park , hollywood undead and of course , eminem . the lyric cover the whole range of problem - political , personal and social . the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album : if everything that mattered to me is now gone . now take a closer look and tell me what you see . track 2 , tell u why , continues with the directly political : we are underground . before you say goodbye , you have got to tell u why . thing get more personal in turn me on , which seems to be about people questioning one route to self-satisfaction . in my song and the thing you think i say , the anguish is over failed relationship . the pursuit ha the line just let me in . if i get the chance to play , i think you will want me to stay . beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time : you are beautiful , so { censored } beautiful . i would be a little more complete if i just had you . just another , never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense , demanding and hypocritical . a for musical influence , there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable . three of the track open with melodic , solemn piano , which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious . i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of , say , nine-inch nail . gave em a reason open with dance music element , then includes some excellent guitar work , both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic , spiritual , up , and grunge is depressing , scary , down . several track have a synth-string background that give them a more mainstream sound . just another includes military-style drumming and army-march lingo . release from numbness come in the final track what you see , with an ironic twist . they sing , open up your eye . nothing more to hide . now the time ha come/and all this go away , and i am not { censored } numb . look around , nothing ever heals the pain . the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them . it could almost be an 80 pop-rock track , and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting . hmmmm . the album is full of explicit language ( which i had to censor in this review ) , so if you are one of those people who can not take that , by all mean stay away . but if you are ok with free expression , you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while .
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening 1. i used this product for about two year , at least 5 day a week , and completed the full 1 hour session each time . i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever . i gave it my best shot , i thought if i kept at it , one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me . but no , nothing , nothing good happened , no overwhelm even , just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean .
1	an outstanding collection of song by a group out of vega , they are featured on the soundtrack for resident evil extinction track 15 contagious i have not heard a new band this good in year . hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music , but these guy . these guy changed all that . thank you adam , ricky , kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius , i look forward to more of your stuff ! check them out on their myspace page [ . ] . add them and tell them alex from nc sent you !
1	love elvis music
0	this is terrible . anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever . it so overplayed & way overrated .
1	this is one of the greatest tune of the year , if not - ever . however , i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it , but it dosent , so now i get to buy another copy of this cd .
0	i came to this wanting to like it . i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever . i have all of rogers solo work , seen him a few time back in the 80 on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour . i am a fan . my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak . if life is really that bad , get a puppy ! i mean , i find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this - i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash . i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here ? i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig ( three different one ) and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death , another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak , i got rid of it . then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it . i never listen to it . this is music to depress yourself to . who need that ? if i want to be depressed i will watch the news . i do not need to hear it in my music . life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race . i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song .
1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song . i just had to get it for her .
1	a good , clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series . to hear it would always take me back to the early 70 . now , it reminds me of that tv series .
0	sick . trash deleting asap

1	another big streisand winner album . great collaboration duo .
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this . would never listen to it ( and i tried ) .
0	when wilson first broke into country music , her hit such a redneck woman , homewrecker and here for the party were cutting , fresh and brash . now her latest single , do not do me no good is just uninspired- it sound like the 101th song out there on country radio . an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is . wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself . she should just take her advice when she sings on this track , yeah i know it aint right/to sit around all night and let your memory/get the best of me .
0	way too much applause at the end .
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not . either way , like it or not , once you hear it , it is stuck in your head . i am one of those who like it , hence , that is why i downloaded it . it may not be the greatest song ever done , but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick .
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song . if this is a good a his song writing get , he need to set down the pen . god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single . i can not help but think of fergie when i hear this song . it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump . except , in this situation , there is a man singing it . it make my stomach churn a i think about it . are there no good male songwriter left in this country !
0	too much talking
1	love this song ! can picture the scene a it play out . a favorite every time i hear it ! thank you !

0	the worst try-hard band i have ever heard - how did these turd get an album out ? oh yeah - rich parent . ugh , lovely . it suck , do not waste your money .
0	really misleading . it is more of a 10 minute show than a full length one . lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it .
1	forget ravel bolero . this is the most sensuous , evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone . it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace . share it with someone you love .
0	ok cd . a few good song but not worth the buy . obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend , this will work
