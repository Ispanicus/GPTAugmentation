1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocaliser is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a spectacular a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more spectacular it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing include a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly misshapen to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a spectacular part in any show it damage the show and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i commit a spell out on you a commemorate by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a commemorate by the grindcore band carcass the misshapen voice is the point of the show and the misshapen voice enhance the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music likewise fassbaender fails to realize that gustav mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i commit a spell out on you for this ground i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disk set the composition on the disk are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this brush up provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same show under the baton of simon rale the rale show is slightly better for reason disclosed below this brush up likewise provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the show by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado show is slightly better for the reason number below endorse by endorse account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening consequence of da klagende lied one of my very favourite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen set out with mute kettle drum at the endorse point the gallic motor horn provide a short thumb then at second the flute sum in the gallic motor horn restart at second and at second the john reed and string sum the fray at second the gallic motor horn sum in again and here they play a real tune not just a thumb at second the melodic phrase provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a grown crescendo but there is not any dos down of cymbal these timing are for the rale show this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly show and for the rale show with the nit finical exception that i list below the chailly show of waldmarchen set out with a backdrop noise hum that last for a endorse but the rale show start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen memorialize under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly time is minute and second while the rale time is minute and second in the chailly show the tenor werner hollweg make his captivate at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodic phrase in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rale show the tenor henry martyn robert tear make his captivate at min second henry martyn robert tear voice is jolly creamy sounding jolly the like of that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rale show for reason unknown to me the chailly show ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in dividing line the rale show ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next crusade in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference of opinion to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rale memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly show clock at while the rale show is the opening minute is distinguished by unaccompanied flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third crusade of da klagende lied is distinguished by the comportment of an off stage band which is a lot quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be discover for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal music soloist at least for this interval of time this crusade likewise feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rale show of da klagende lied the rale show wa commemorate at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and spectacular in dividing line the chailly show could be characterized a very slightly muddy likewise i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly show with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly show there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado show some of the song are sung by the virile while others by the female person my favourite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i the like of this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz crusade in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notable feature of the abbado show are the fluttery fluting motif occurring at second and second and the five endorse donkey the like of braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece reason out with a low volume cryptic sounding chinese gong i choose the abbado show over the chailly show for many reason first of all the chailly show of the fish song ha too a lot echo likewise in the chailly show the fluttery fluting motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and bat with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a lot noticeable in the chailly show likewise the very end of the piece in the chailly show feature a spectacular low note from a bassoon and to my ear the cryptic sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly show to reiterate these point what i the like of and choose about the abbado show is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and cryptic chinese gong termination the chailly show provides a great survival of the fittest of gustav mahler piece that are not keep down symphony a measured side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly show with other memorialize will enable any listener to adjudicate on a favored show i did my own side by side comparison and learn that i had a slight preference for memorialize under the baton of simon rale and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favourite of gustav mahler composition and it ha been my favourite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only xx year old
0	i like the cd or better said prince music my problem is the packaging is crap i broke the cd in half just to get it out the cd snapped like a potato chip seriously product quality mean everything not just the music
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie this album wasnt anything great i desire the new movie will blow my sock off
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i e passenger not and wasnt worth keeping i tossed it in the trash what a waste of

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this is a good song dont wa easy to download with no washington problem at all sure the album is good
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without arrangement always disappointing be forewarned it wa revealed small print

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more a traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start have a bun in the oven this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud embody and dumb sound youd expect to fill an vocalize arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston have a bun in the oven mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal first of all over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst hairgrip most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel greek chorus like the least of a departure from their old braggy sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out group a from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of attention getting tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some middling deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nigh had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a mightily anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include ignominy right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a gifted songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out select music it a great respite to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of franz peter schubert unfinished symphony work on period legal document doubtlessly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london greco roman player are a highlight of this recording the music is work with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the atomic number symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes ferment miracle with lesser known or le popular ferment his interpretation of beethoven nd and atomic number symphony are in some mode his sound in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the atomic number yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music comparable this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london greco roman player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer work by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who comparable fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin european olive tree oil and balsamy vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty nub stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	not such a great cd only one meet my expectation
1	i care listening to demi lavatos music she is pretty good i bought it for my kindle fire hd you should care it too
1	i dont agree with the other reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school vocalise beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some grievous vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something same that hope this help
1	you have to consider though that music of this genial sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme point of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are debatable modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme point of bulk for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic lay out is not rattling a john major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	only buzz off this for a friend

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this group a audio encounter is amour not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing crosswise between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe audio recording not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her savour expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer embody but to me songwriting is not associate in nursing her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of make all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would non deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to convert be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with take hold of brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	tragically it ha been single twelvemonth since the existence lost single of the most sincerest diva of the existence the dandy natalie cole but if there is single thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney shaft and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of dandy song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the buy the farm of her darling father nat king cole and start into jazz euphony after twelvemonth of r b but she had some dandy song for everyone alone a smile like yours is single of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweetened and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a single of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting lie with i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune lyric and biblical truth furler and his writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff christian radio

0	recording by senegalese singer sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here the cheesiness personally perceived is that the african song in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to further song feature a a long annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey niger invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i to review this recording now that it ha available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na your but which is decent not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros an old humorous about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang a simple and great tune for song which is a son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than one from the original vinyl which my bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	censored version but information technology it had the explicit label
1	love this song can picture the scene a it play out a favorite every clip i hear it thank you
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan i own all of their previous album therefore i wa all excited for this album to come out even though i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much they are not i would will not waste any on this album it is a very big disappointment especially judging it based on their previous work they and should be putting better work than this
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the are more prominent it therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i a spell on you a recorded by screaming hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a you for this reason i recommend only da klagende but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben are on this compilation this a side side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one the song from da wunderhorn the song about the fish with recording by thomas qusthoff and beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point french horn provide a short then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray second the french horn join in again and here they a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch one minute and second come a crescendo is a crescendo but there is not crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the for the chailly recording and for the rattle with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is and second while the rattle timing is and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight for the rattle recording for reason unknown me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there no discernable difference to my ear in the minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music vocal soloist at for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a volume and brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced in the abbado recording some of the song are sung the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender at the same pitch the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording the very end of the in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is crisper sound and the easily discernable flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	this is by far most unappreciated work yet of his best a between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook it is unique it is honest and it is meaningful the song come from the heart and are best a soulmate a bottle wine and quiet evening i never appreciated rod stewart until i heard this

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before begin please note that i really wanted to like this album im writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough blame this squarely on the departure of head untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead untouchable wa a good album not mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band putting together a many track a they could with little regard the way they would on an album when you their early work the band wrote song that were driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not say the album since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album the last yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught in giving a new album a review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about record month or a year down the in month will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or more than a few week in the recording studio really dig deep for something from the soul the is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel non the da song soon divergence and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not call particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and da spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it call would have had i not already had all the song the call interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and district attorney would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better call found in their original context shotgun reason out angel

1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
1	call love this song
1	there were a couple of top song from this album but the entire compendium is solid and ha a unique sound
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a enrollment that is more often than not flute sound for the first part of the fugue which permit sufficiency transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the ending i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a mild forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic bodoni font equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i advocate it and the entire set

0	ive been a handsome boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa i that buzz off away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha bestow in online auction so when this reissue wa put out i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert francis charles augustus emmanuel bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the crusade of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from i another the rather pointless ra do of astronomy seems to bespeak that there wasnt enough material to shape with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be put out a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt remuneration for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen onetime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	i very rarely bother to write a reappraisal unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of live on great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical guild inspired geological era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the speedy fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating analgesic all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist unremarkably a complex potpourri of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolheaded and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a common you can tell he swarm alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a or else of a dont get me wrong there are secure track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty secure then slows down horrifically for the live on two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the sung dynasty beat sound trim and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a basso cd to pop in your gondola if you have a secure sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would live on buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical mammoth idol boring
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can a nice helping when i hear it new band abica up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social title track the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in i get the chance play i think want me to stay beautiful ha a that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id a little more complete if i just had you just another that far away and nothing here generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both and psychedelic provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing down several track have a synth string that give them a sound just another includes military style and army march lingo release from numbness come the track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
1	occur on it led zeppelin d
0	something tell that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those mallcore band like korn and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal explode into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiney about how miserable life do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade

1	tragically it ha been one year since the creation lost one of the most solemn diva of the creation the great natalie colewort but if there is one matter that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made birdcall that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great birdcall that she immortalize when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her dearest father nat king colewort and went into get it on music after twelvemonth of r b but she had some great birdcall for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those birdcall that is worth hearing to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie cart track with the same title name from it is a pin up song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a birdcall like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie colewort song b

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy story this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this da for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get non it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant sight criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total entirely disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to linguistic context make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this inward one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found divergence in their stool original context shotgun angel
0	sorry the head and the heart but i just dont get it i would love to buy every one of your album this just it worth the money
1	this album reminded me why i loved the melodic phrase newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and merge music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time defy when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it group a a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus prick over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare group a i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff thus on christian radio

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female atomic number singer with a beautiful graceful voice who group a doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from dissipated the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing consistency between the atomic number party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem make to take part at all the appeal of little edie had dollar always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all associate in nursing and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	despite this being a label album it really just criticise another flame album v rose only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated entirely from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in sea tang to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion im kinda tang disappointed a the guest criticise did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album wa that good overall
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd wish i would have listened to it first not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song didnt work for me there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much succeeder with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising traverse for all those that have it off their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you power find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat energy who screw a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont call back the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked to some degree but is embarrassingly in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for second clip in a song or that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this the worst album theyve ever out in my opinion and i hope they look a new drummer skip this chapter
1	this wa a pretty unspoilt album i wish it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the infliction but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never handle before

1	keeping it rattling real
0	second of what the hunger game intro do not get this download you will regret it need i more
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im the organist just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and job one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a forte there no extreme of dynamic i think this would be a good choice listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but embody found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and get hold of good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not refreshful by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know exploitative the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the lilliputian appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal lilliputian this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	this song is awesome im not huge fan of three day grace but this is by far favorite
0	this is terrible anything by this artist should have never mode gotten popular what so ever it so overplayed way overrated
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone united state of america who ha loved and lost basically all of u just about
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are fatten out embody pretty nice if youre looking for strictly fit in old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat rhythm beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help
0	that is quite stupid to put that short on to be purchased i will find something better not worth
0	not deserving the price this digital download wa free
0	not worth the price digital download wa free
0	this by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha offer in york with the exception of the three song already mentioned this recording wa course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively tune the problem here the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little guitar and some trap drum in the background get my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what want to do and i do not have the knowledge to do it i just to warn buyer that half the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba a song maracaibo oriental is brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	imo this sound like something i couldve done with a flirt toy saxophone awful listen to the preview if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great then go for it

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered medicine tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha solitary had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is technical school slowwwwwed well nigh down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller showcase all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple entirely bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this emphatically album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong group a there are good track on this cd most rose hip of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are dispirited only a few memorable track on the entire second half nightclub of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech record hop wa trying to a make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the full reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd group a that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune northeastward to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible sabbatum album for the status quo i am sure it will sell record well i will definitely take a long inward listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i know im singular going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this untouchable album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they upwards think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get inward the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who exit think im dumb enough to blame this wild squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror record album thither featured survey head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror enunciate wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other delight side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a lambaste many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album coiffe when you listen to their early work the band wrote washington song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern record album that wa introduced back in the s embody with each track embody it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest agnise of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this untouchable album than the last two yes non doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up familiar spirit in giving a new album bargain a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will cash in one chip have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it sentence on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that information technology once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of make expression either that record album or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and singular really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have stick most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up intimately it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an seek at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinct from one some other the quite pointless re do of astronomy seems to suggest that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue air huitre cultus album evidently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and promise to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	stylistically i love all typecast of music but how do i classify fireflights record album for those who wait record album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this record album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teen with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the lack person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are slyly and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video uncommitted for your viewing pleasure there a true story being told in each vocal i assure you
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome inveterate and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant knocker but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all on oh well

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or grindcore music such a exhume consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc all by gustav mahler they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side of de knaben wunderhorn with the recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from classical repertoire waldmarchen with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed string join the fray at second the french horn join in and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a crescendo it is a big crescendo but there not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording the of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle is minute and second in the chailly the tenor werner hollweg make entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck chailly recording clock at while the is the opening minute is distinguished by flourish from the kettle drum a strong line provided by tuba and stringed bass and brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while others by the female favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at the piece concludes with low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato clarinet donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate point what i like and prefer about the recording is the crisper sound the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only year old

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for palpate me this genre is shroud a side dish not vocalize the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more prevarication asleep universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot in general of our generation right now the non way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love psyche it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas annoyance lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead asleep and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range sideline of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered call back to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are receptive underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u full why thing get more personal in turn me sociable on which seems to some be about people rapper questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get group a the chance to play i think youll want me united state of america to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had invigorated you just return another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing operate in a society include that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you only that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy particular and psychedelic inward a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the separate pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had well nigh to censor in this review so if you are return one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i equivalence need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i tang would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to monetary value go to get there

1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music it doe lack some deficiency key piece which is why i gave it four star no danse macabre barely and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist i atomic number highly recommend it
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation jibe jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation this work very good and i think that rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes needed it a lot roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even it modern orchestra make this music so ponderous and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it rockin song causing to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to up the heat who knew a lil song turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be to an mtv you soon
0	a much a i preferably really wanted this to work it preferably absolutely did not the voice is irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better considering all of the experience this guy ha i expected so much better dont buy it it a waste of your galling money

0	for the lift or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and unrecorded show so that i may justify my ruling here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my allegiance to a band i loved i buzzword convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is hood but they made it through i will storage area out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching information technology for the original hit that inspired this knock off collection might get one of these look for instead even worse they might mistake it for the original collection like this need more one star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in colorado writing his song and im sure this unity is no elision however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore alike youd require it to sorry lenny maybe next time lead end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this unity sound alike he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
1	fantastic
0	i think it time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i dont prefer spanish people singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this record album is that more than half the song on this record album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why reuse the same song i dont get it

1	love dog the work wish the cd had more track
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but receive this audio sashay a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent picture documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the step throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the charm of little edie had always been her grammatical construction body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	the sung dynasty is great but this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the sung dynasty making it impossible for me to listen to

0	im from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i not to get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it wa the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly a s uk edition whoever mastered these should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new they dont sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten master most of their album along the way but rocknroll imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the information technology problem is that first of all it doesnt former thither sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by embody bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort associate in nursing of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song identical are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going comparable to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a embody blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt beaming pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	i accidentally bought it i hate it i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it it certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor

0	this should a lot better however it isnt dont waste your money brian
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released position on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest download silliest and corniest the label ha courteous to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already roughly mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in bacillus trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here inward aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in gallic african dialect and in french reprint are melodic phrase totally uneventful group a bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and pappa totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of officious slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it matter feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a play traditional african style of dance that other country in africa year also love to unaccompanied dance melodic phrase to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a unaccompanied long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de any ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut daddy juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut instrumentalist juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming a from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you uncommitted to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe rocknroll song anichayi which aint stool gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp dog downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate cease a pianist alfredo recording label valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a showcase house of york much better african music project that past showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each reprint to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are unaccompanied embody appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check aught it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the past final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is group a an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the saltation reputation of being a utilise jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with parenthesis a set of solid group a horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the inward end the platitudinous fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish group a slang basically group a a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago from each one and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and boulder clay said that the other song went on for roughly too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening a carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary softly davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while spell picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of sea bass red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and comparable present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the listen tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	stylistically i passion all type of music but how do i classify fireflights record album for those who wait record album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this record album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and soda water musicalness of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you light headed ole bear still although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are disingenuously and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each vocal i assure you
1	have it off them
0	i accidentally bought it i hate it i think you have by chance to have a military background to enjoy it it certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor

1	classic redman gladiolus to see him back
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant that it my favorite work theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before

1	you can b sure that this tune is still great get it now it will bring dorsum old memory and sound all new at the same time
0	ok cd a few good song but not worth the buy obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend this will knead

1	this is great sound and is good in everything that she sings if you this like i do get all of her music
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out music it a great reprieve to the increasingly and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n atomic number to be one of go great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about old age now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativeness and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid burn down flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa wholly uninspired i am used to tech play down mix to be a strong point of this artist unremarkably a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sample distribution around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are perplex a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only intellect i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the go part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from former tech n atomic number cd sound like tech wa attempt to make a bass cd to pop in your gondola if you have a good sound system not the intellect i bargain tech n atomic number if i want to thump my trunk i would go bargain one of the other crap hip hop cd that appear to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to observe up with current metre he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n atomic number album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the mix dj could fatten up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like hope this help

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long information technology passably past the disco day comparable of the mid to thither late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys information technology hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound called make the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten draw a blank in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle exchangeable that accompanied this song but i dont have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps youll clue u in
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a record a collector of original cast album le of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than musical comedy full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone monetary value le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial fall issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	i have purchased both installment of the flick but found this audio expedition a niggling tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and beneficial taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the four hundred came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont make out the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the invoke of niggling edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a niggling humdrum
0	back in the very early i this the cassette tape version and thought it wa amazing until i bought the cd recently i realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me it wa almost to listen to and remain a huge fan of techno electronic music i would only recommend this for laugh or a s nostalgia night
0	this poor grass is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i couldnt listen to more than one song on this disk because it wa so scratched up i know thats the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a good check yet of it wa unplayable very disappointed
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file window medium of my pc now i can not load the song onto my android phone i tried over and over again the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely not make me happy a a customer will someone call or email me and straighten this out
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a listen regardless of the quality or content this is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think dumb enough to blame this the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both you the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track they could with little regard the way they would on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one wonder polluting radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe music stand out not really i sometimes also up in giving a new album a remarkable review one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp theyll be listening the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone need find new channel expression either that or spend more than a few in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	not worth the price this digital download wa
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that contrast is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to beaver state be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice continue for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through lot earphone in plane compressing or listening in car so inward the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa condition made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at vocal storey i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an autonomous being and would pitch an autonomous voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the animation ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it decent airplay to find if it went deeper a a line i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	invariably always smooth
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this absolutely after four of some of the strongest metalcore record album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional grueling metal shape unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox theme resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it cycle section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic cram fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first i besides follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate fad against the machine knockoff penning on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a cram pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced averageness i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of averageness from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	wrong purchase
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem that first of it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite effort of musician a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous hardly distinguishable from another the rather pointless re do of seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be staple fibre one of last great group a bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always record album been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this stool album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple former of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all dim witted day before recording technical school either the full dj wa completely embody uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this identical artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell mystify he poured alot of himself into this album the only writing style reason i am giving this a instead of group a a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to along make a bass stool cd to pop in your car if you have a present good sound system not the reason make i buy tech n invariably ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the testament market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up enceinte with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa course an obvious intent trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a african singer on the front cover and including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap in the background which get on nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression on the phone to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell to download the maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to skipped bought for on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of vista in descargas journal archive i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big diamoul rock solid cuban tune which also happen to song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a introductory trumpet solo by cuban alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some trumpet playing towards the end chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music mean jam session song most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout tune pelta meaning jerk in slang basically a and tune for which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but get this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste apparent from the excellent video recording documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of bank and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take break at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshen vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this product take the form two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all other piece in the two the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult the tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role any recording the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the and the distorted voice enhances of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below chailly recording waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that for a second but the rattle recording start with not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas thus i have very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight robert tear voice over the tinny of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature prominent low note from a bassoon and to my the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily fluttery donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side side comparison of of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that had a slight preference for the baton of simon rattle and claudio da klagende lied my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know nonetheless i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that northeast yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to squinch the tantamount to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the check line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who write this piece of molder cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of molder good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they write a new song in the elevator on their way up i like northeast yo but his singing leaf a caboodle to be desired this song suck badly i think the other commentator must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music stage business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what admittedly singing talent is any longer cause this isnt it
0	i non will not marry you woman it rude to keep asking
0	just non not the same a bon jovi

1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week deftones is one of my favorite band
1	love it ha a bluesy reasoned
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if this is a good a his song writing get he need to set down the pen god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single i cant help but think of fergie when i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation there a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i think about it are there no good male songwriter left in this country
1	i know that some people can discus at length the deserve of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same ire the same desperation the same hard edge but i remember that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to make something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel divorce and numb to all the chaos we call off life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric shine this state of affair and musically they attractor on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer feeling and separate me what you see track separate u why continues with the directly political we are subway system before you say goodbye youve got to separate u why thing get more personal in become me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you remember i say the hurt is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the prospect to play i remember youll want me to stay beautiful ha a word that ha sure entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of animation a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track opened with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be rattling and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch pinpoint gave em a reason open with trip the light fantastic toe music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is cheerless scary down respective track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military dash swot and army march lingo release from indifference come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing opened up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb feeling around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could about be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit voice communication which i had to ban in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all imply stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well prescribed a on ebay and in certain record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it group a very convincingly smell made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but only a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography yet presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
0	unmannerly im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me project want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store embody just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is measure enough torture seriously comparable the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a embody bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the telling trash by mistake and had to information technology turn in something quick so they wrote a inward new song in the elevator on their way dogshit up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in let the cat out of the bag h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent mystify is anymore cause this isnt it
0	i download this song because it wa free and have regretted it but free is free so you get what you get

0	the recording is not good the voice and the instrument dont have a good balance i wish i could get the studio instead of this live one i think i a choosing this version his you tube music ha better recording than this
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are hard korn fan and are insistent it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever untouchable there ha been a noticeable steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this on the departure of head both untouchable take a look in featured head a the guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know the song change or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the released since have been bad just worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also up in a album a remarkable review after one because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable

0	this recording by singer laba sosseh on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer new york with the exception the song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa love to dance to and them to dance it even further song feature a a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice him on beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being of using bland lyric totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say than trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros maybe song which aint gon na change your but which is decent enough not to skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that the properly or with a classic cuban style of that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this are appalling example of what african should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar while i havent heard it properly i can still that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one that near maracaibo oriental overall album doe better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session pelta probably written miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune song which is a enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and i happily transferred onto a cd through friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue the high end of the commercial price range

1	my kid love this song it is so much fun to listen to and sing along with bonus i dont get tired of get a line it
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far this listener is concerned towards the i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through in or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in that this wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	not many good song a middling effort from a big talent

1	this product train the form of two compact disc on the decca mark the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender monition regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the pillow slip that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potentiality to cause the listener to be nark irritated and angry in some sort of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to see that mahler music is not grindcore music likewise fassbaender fails to see that mahler music is not some type of novelty birdcall a is the pillow slip with i put a spell on you for this ground i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four sung dynasty of sung dynasty of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all basketball team sung dynasty are here only three of the thirteen of the sung dynasty of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is more or le better for reason disclosed below this review likewise provides a side by side comparison of one of the sung dynasty from da knaben wunderhorn the birdcall about the fish with the recording by norman mattoon thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is more or le better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very front runner piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn bring home the bacon a short riff then at second the flute unite in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string unite the fray at second the french horn unite in again and here they make for a real contrast not just a riff at second the tune provided by the entire orchestra descend to a downcast flip and the antecedently represent motif are reiterated but at the downcast flip at one hour and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any wreck of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i tilt below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a backdrop noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful tune in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is more or le tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert buck make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is slightly creamy sounding slightly like that of norman mattoon thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert buck and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my auricle in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening hour is distinguished by solo expand from the kettle drum a strong bass contrast provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this rd movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be get wind for example in the musical interval of to when the off stage band is trifle the only other source of music is outspoken soloist at least for this musical interval of time this movement likewise feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more nippy and spectacular in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very more or le squashy likewise i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following comparability da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by norman mattoon thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three sung dynasty a i mentioned above and these are babble by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the sung dynasty are babble by the male while others by the female my front runner of all of the sung dynasty from da knaben wunderhorn is the birdcall about the fish and i like this one the secure because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphonic music no in any event this comparability the fish birdcall de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the basketball team second donkey like mash from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mystical sounding taiwanese gong i opt the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish birdcall ha too much echo likewise in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same flip a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey level headed is not much noticeable in the chailly recording likewise the very close of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my auricle the mystical sounding taiwanese gong doe not fall out at the close of the chailly recording to reiterate these breaker point what i like and opt about the abbado recording is the crisper level headed and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey mash and mystical taiwanese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a majuscule extract of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a heedful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very front runner of mahler composition and it ha been my front runner since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty dollar bill year old

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have make up one mind to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would neer bear from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section choke for the big loud and mute sound youd bear to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd pace rage against the machine knockoff written material on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad try at corey taylor angst ridden song over a drum pattern airlift from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a deviation from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only urge this for pd completionists and masochist

0	terrible lot music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame a rape victim
1	this album reminded me why i do it the newsboy so much through the s and s these birdcall are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric poem and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep conception and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa race and about had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include disgrace right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the birdcall on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fuck up on christian radio
1	great song long length thought provoking brings back good memory from the recollective s youll ask yourself where wa i when i heard that

1	awesome song and it gymnasium a timeless classic i dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
0	actually it didnt the first tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all if inward anything the cricket noise would keep entirely one awake and i just found it too irritating
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so much better not that no name face wa bad the album first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made me dizzy a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it

0	not honorable
0	the reading of the song is not my favorite unfortunately i think this is the only reading released i even tried to find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able
1	heard the song on the radio the other day to download the song brought back memory when i wa younger
1	this product take the form of compact disc on the decca label conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and beliner philharmoniker under baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle at the second the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif reiterated but at the lower pitch at minute and second a momentary crescendo is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for chailly recording and for the rattle with nit picky exception that i list below chailly of begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make entrance min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is tear and the baritone sean rea next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be for example in the interval of to when the off band is playing the only source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy i have a slight preference robert tear voice over the tinny voice of the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all the song from da knaben wunderhorn is song about the and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding gong i prefer the abbado recording over chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter with her vibrato the donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a and to my ear mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is crisper sound and more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	wasteland a much a i really wanted this to work it absolutely did not the voice is irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at best and wasteland the relaxation technique hurried and not effective a cup of warm milk is cheaper and information technology work better considering all of the experience this guy ha i expected so much better dont buy it it a waste of your money

0	i came of age during the s and s to master this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to smell the upper crust if you like this edition industrious at least also treat yourself to the original
1	classic redman glad to see greco roman him back
0	did not like the song at all i remove it from my download very disappointed in the way it is song and the music

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but this expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at and wa frankly a little
1	i didnt like it at information technology first after listening to it a few time i got it it beautiful lanny is a musical genius
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion technical school of hip sabbatum hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging glued through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is nerve racking slowwwwwed down tech some rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple identical of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat bare around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to north tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of non the coolest and oddest sampling around this album outside rarely showcase anything more common than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this citadel album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of unattackable the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for lyric poem the last two part disk jockey there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in medicine your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n compact disc ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the appear other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he roughly now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
1	at the age of and widowed i have been locomote with this woman who i like very much i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her this wa unmatchable of those song in all there wa song that i picked out i will have to tell you is wa some work to come up the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it wa more then charles frederick worth it after i take in the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level so if you want to impress that unmatchable you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that expressage your love for her

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before practically i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known group a or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some glorious way his best psyche in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the chill th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put le me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player roughly are all acetum splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more group a composer without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad medicine dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar le washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled le vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i know im going to get lambasted inward for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to go over like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and dog are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review later is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since world health organization untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn upwards album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the rakehell lead guitar untouchable wa a good sentence album not great mirror wa still place upright decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the record album the korn sound wa lost associate in nursing after issue and the band started putting together a many young extinct track a they could title with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on young their debut album to along somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or embody launch liberal into a catchy chorus this is call back not to smell say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest unwavering of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i effect ask myself information technology if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone delight radiocommunication they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend mystify more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is embody riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende group a lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece class bowed stringed instrument in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore embody the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly spell distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on infra you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume song a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the reason out point of the recording and the divergence distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reiterate reason i recommend only da klagende lied but unknown quantity am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de fanfare knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are outstanding here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle hawk the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas tenor voice qusthoff gallic atomic number and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado embody the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of a the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute atomic number join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the thither fray at second the french horn join in again little and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big dwell crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing sea bass are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception line of merchandise vocalize that i list below the well chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing inward is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the besides most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire body forth mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his da entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in french the identical opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute call is distinguished causal agent by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off solitary stage band which is much endorse quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band spell can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music tuba is vocal soloist at least for this interval of memorialise time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following dwell reason i have a slight preference for the dwell rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at dwell a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the memorialise tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only introduce memorialise three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much atomic number echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because spread out brigitte fassbaender sings at the same group a pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice recording label flitter and flutter with her sort vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding basically chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the twist embody chailly recording to reiterate these point whatever what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound group a and the da more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the wand chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison dwell of any of israel baline the piece on the fluting chailly flunk recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did memorialise my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of embody mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this record by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar mark is for me ace of the sorry new york sar recording that you can retrieve and definitely the cheesiest silliest and bromidic the mark ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this record wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front hatch and by including some exclusively african tune the trouble here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is much too busy chit chatting rubbish rather of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly lay back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a exclusive chorus or a exclusive musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a bland a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the goal other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coco nucifera any that mean and to come and drink fresh coco nucifera juice with him on the beach he even wee the impression helium on the phone mouth to the people of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh coco nucifera juice too while latin music ha much being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the goal which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i settle to followup this record now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the prissy pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na interchange your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this mark wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jnr explained on his fascinating interview the word of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of record that is the mark and the musician speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to disbelieve african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been ace more laba sosseh record on sar in and while i havent hear it properly i can still tell that it a better record album than this ace there definitely a slight extra worry within the tune and although there isnt ace track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big smash diamoul yap rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another smash being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh displaced person b esgx w ref cm cr arp cholecalciferol rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brainy montno descrga tune it feature a brightly action piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jnr that work to perfection with this perplex tune till the goal there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago de los caballeros perplex horn trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the goal by chocolate accompanying the concluding horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a tug otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly lay back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras elevation chino and some hunky dory trumpet playing by chocolate towards the goal the hunky dory chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning tug in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough word montno tune ill let you lot take the punt voice quality on this reissue seems absolutely hunky dory but not better than the ace from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unstimulating too

0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i dont think that this embody wa the way translate to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better vocaliser way to express herself these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too

1	heard the song on the radio the other had to download the song brought back memory when i wa younger
1	you have to consider though that moldiness music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency psyche mode for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one kraft paper a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture grain thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the mystify extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy make but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	enceinte great

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother lilliputian this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the passably cd came across a excited only college refreshful student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and arouse wa frankly a little humdrum

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

1	from out of left field of operation come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic wine sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty finger of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song get it to end up a really weird but fun compounding for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something moderately decent oh by the way i dont think the euphony video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	crystal bowersox ha alot offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all a piece and all at one vocal level i think the with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting bible and music to them that work utterly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and well nigh had to stop and have a good military man outcry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i articulate truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a gifted songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to contain more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition leave in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the gravid loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an sphere bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then vocalize like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff committal to writing on the wall is a complete trick with winston mccall doing a badness attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen regnant we will rock you complete with dubbed in fiddle whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete exit of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	i love his music and message
1	love it fun dance song

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and orchestra is deutsches symphonie berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of such a put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler is not grindcore music also fassbaender to that mahler music is not some type novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden all four song of song a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle is slightly better for reason disclosed below this also provides a by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben the song about the fish the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of klagende lied one of my very favorite from the classical repertoire begin with muffled kettle drum at the point the french horn provide a riff then at second flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune just a riff at second melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part da klagende lied are essentially the for the chailly recording and for the recording with the nit picky exception that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor hollweg his at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring this movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other of music is vocal soloist at least for this of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and are more crisp and dramatic contrast the chailly recording characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these sung by brigitte fassbaender us a vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben is the song about the fish and i like this one best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly provides a great selection of mahler that are not numbered a careful side by side of any of the on the recording with other recording will enable any to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i dont agree with earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	terrible use of auto melodic phrase
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is group a mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and see reed still keeping within a modest sufficiency forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would psyche be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to upwards reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so inward the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that dynamic this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting track i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i like the track dedicated a it feel like the of a from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	love the band but there only one song on this release seriously anything that say feat in it passe and unoriginal if youre so good why do you need it like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together and now everyone is doing it seriously keep the dj out none of the good one know wtf they are doing ill on this one collide is much better and song at that

0	it information technology ok
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent giving it a star after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since there ha been a noticeable yet steady in the quality of korn album and those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror head a lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way would flow on an album when you listen to their early the band wrote song that were emotionally driven daddy on their album to someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in s with each track it took little imagination to know when song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric no doe the music stand out not i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved new material but lately been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener have stopped reviewing new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont to rip band because theyre still one of my favorite but band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig for something from soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying just cant say anything good this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying is iowa this is worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	uplifting intoxicate encouraging
0	it sounded good on the later clip after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought id be
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a forte because are no of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major bear in mind that this recording wa made in the but it hold up i recommend it and the entire set

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought brigham young a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style vocalize i wa very disappointed his sound doe not work with these song it not enjoyable the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound but the choice of song vocalize wa wrong sorry bob
1	i the book with cassette year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i dont know if the music would stand alone gorgeous ha variety of flavor to it it sound like song from a id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the wa ready to be born ancient ancestor stretched and and began to the a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who what she wa and shes told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star to out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

1	great song long length view provoking brings back good memory from the s youll ask yourself where wa i when i heard that
0	this recording by senegalese singer melodic phrase laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new overly york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest involvement and corniest the label ha to offer in new disrepute york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in check french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which melodic phrase get on my nerve military policeman the st song doesnt even offer a single brawny chorus or a single musician solo it feature bespeak laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy one half that ngombelle is a traditional african style mass of dance that other single out country in africa also love to dance to spanish people and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc saltation de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than beaver state that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and hither sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he nether even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to call invite them for a fresh coconut juice too body forth while latin music ha often being accused of using recording label bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else lyric poem to say information technology other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided past to review this recording now that it cakehole ha group a been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the mystify nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change embody associate your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on little his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal advocate mystify archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music uncommitted project that showcase the music properly or with include a classic make cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not effect to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do along it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording group a on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt tied one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i make wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba former sosseh a song trump maracaibo oriental is literally a a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything separate work to perfection on this tune and everyone is information technology really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune showcase about somebody having made inward himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing greek chorus by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically unaccompanied a simple and great tune for along song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unluckily this is the latter ive always considered technical school n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop skip music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspire era of hip hop skip we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativeness and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down technical school rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like technical school sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist ordinarily a complex mixture of big organisation synthesizer different time signature other literary genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimal of any accompanying music the language are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only conclude i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is passably good then slows down horrifically for the last two parting there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous technical school n ne cd sound like technical school wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your elevator car if you have a good sound system not the conclude i buy technical school n ne if i wanted to pound my trunk i would pop off buy one of the other crap hip hop skip cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop skip artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with flow time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next technical school n ne album before jumping in ft for the first time with a purchase again

1	im not sure why this doorkeeper bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an genial almost standard from see cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is kail a very good straight certain version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which past ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must dynamic just not get in the way of it full walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance interahamwe would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in advanced car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire railcar group a set

0	it ok but not iggys information technology best
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i have purchase both installment of the movie but found this audio sashay a little tedious and fairly deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and affair is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body terminology and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa candidly a little humdrum

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy fun lyric and biblical truth furler his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together of the for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and a good man cry it a song written from perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few highlight for me shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	tragically it ha one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana have not been able to show all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in s she made peace with passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i start please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only pen this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn sport fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen no matter of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb plenty to darned this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror boast head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa even decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not hold up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the right smart they would flow on an album when you listen to their former work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to soul someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change pace or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been spoiled they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release auditory sensation closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one collide with wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes a well get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i label and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the memorialise calendar month or a year down the road in calendar month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they ab initio heard it the first time they start in the candle or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre even one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is run short they demand to find new channel of expression either that or drop more than a few week in the recording studio and really toil deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it a well forgettable my

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which scattergun is the weakest song on public it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it solitary i cant criticize sensation the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be entirely the sight case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i good call spiritual vision i really felt like information technology only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i holy person settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	this ware take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac m singer is brigitte fassbaender warning see fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal music are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal music are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to birdsong it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato lawsuit fassbaenders singing to be grossly twisted to be a perversion and to be an vilification to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a commemorate by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to eat up a commemorate by the grindcore stripe carcass the twisted voice is the point of the recording and the twisted voice raise the pleasance of the listening experience but fassbaender neglect to recognize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender neglect to recognize that mahler music is not some type of novelty birdsong a is the case with i put a spell on you for this cause i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only ternion of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a face by face compare of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason divulge below this review also provides a face by face compare of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the birdsong about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason lean below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the spread out moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen start out with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the total orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one second and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky elision that i number below the chailly recording of waldmarchen start out with a background noise hum that go for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the truncheon of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is second and second while the rattle timing is second and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min security and exchange commission singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert bout voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very fragile preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in direct contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my pinna in the spread out second of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the spread out second is grand by unaccompanied flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass business provided by sousaphone and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is grand by the presence of an off stage stripe which is much smooth than the on stage orchestra the off stage stripe can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage stripe is playing the only other origin of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of metre this movement also feature a chorus line preference for the following reason i have a fragile preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa commemorate at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more potato chip and dramatic in direct contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly mucky also i have a fragile preference for robert bout voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only ternion song a i mentioned above and these are let the cat out of the bag by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are let the cat out of the bag by the male person while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the birdsong about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that chance in the waltz movement in mahler philharmonic no at any rate this compare the fish birdsong de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif pas at second and second and the five second donkey like grind from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish birdsong ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very finish of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low remark from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not happen at the finish of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute donkey grind and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not total symphony a heedful face by face compare of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own face by face comparison and discovered that i had a fragile preference for recording under the truncheon of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty old age honest to goodness

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin mystifying the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in infra these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a memorialise recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of gum olibanum the listening experience while but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type besides of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but call am not able to recommend the other piece on this memorialise disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of class da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied spell eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of embody de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by death side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn druthers the song about the fish with the recording by thomas in any event qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied flunk one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray memorialise at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a car horn lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one along minute and second come monitory a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is disc not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same establishment for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with stilbestrol the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that complete last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second spread out while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor interpreter werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful equivalence melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in position the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice along is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording group a for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner thus wand hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening tenor voice minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided embody by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the restrained off equivalence stage band can be heard for example in cease the interval of to when memorialise the off stage band is write playing the only other car horn source of music is vocal gum olibanum soloist at least for this interval happen of time indite this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i vocalize have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass tam tam and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas status quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von former otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender spectacular who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i hither like group a this one the best testament because it is the same melody a favor that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway feature film this recording label compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery trend flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at druthers the same pitch a the flute spread out and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter discernible with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the memorialise chailly recording feature a prominent low note from memorialise a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point hawk what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is wand the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great call selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other overly recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton lot of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed philharmonic when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you dont either way it or not once you hear it it stuck in your head im one of who like it hence thats i downloaded it it may not be the greatest song ever done but it ha solid construction which is what make a song tick
0	art garfunkel his version wa much better more relaxed and much smoother i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr grobans range
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however past someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out past supporter heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by along a company called major league or something like that hope this help
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality content this review is not for you im not going review each track because once youve heard the first youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great wa still decent ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a rating this new release sound to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the memorable no doe the music stand out really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll how they heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable candidly it also forgettable my
0	ive purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been well chosen i always make sure i get across on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail album so i heed to the ur so gay prevue and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and heed to it and it censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her atomic number that you can bribe in the store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it a censored version when they dont offer the existent version at all now im stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled

1	this is by far the best cd mj ha create
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new house of york big sophisticated city image
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good for listening to a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for and easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily for you to like

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the unassailable metalcore record album to egress post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would neer expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm segment going for the big tatty and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like humiliated which first bite off paradise shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a divergence from their former sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an record album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	low vocalise quality i deleted
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious embody vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with vocalize music they could check out heat beat vol keep company by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help
0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here fate but i wa a big fan milk river and formerly yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that grandness there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they monotone will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
1	forget ravel bolero this is the redolent most sensuous evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share it with someone you love

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie body forth but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter play is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came arouse across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared audio recording shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little embody edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to alexa
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they lack to buy korn triad for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen disregarding of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and strike a look in the mirror have head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a upright album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self entitle album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn levelheaded wa lost after issue and the circle started putting unitedly a many track a they could with little regard to the manner they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the circle wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the birdcall would change pacing or launching into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been unsound they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis levelheaded angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the medicine stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new textile but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i guess and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a twelvemonth down the route in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll bury how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp histrion theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont lack to rip the circle because theyre still one of my favorite but a circle should recognize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few workweek in the commemorate studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not horrific but it unremarkable and honestly it also forgettable my
0	actually it didnt the first tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake and i just found it too irritating

1	im not sure why this is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard maybe an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me personally for that reason i think i rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expect another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they crataegus oxycantha never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement roll from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are recognise with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful hear and will in the end prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the broad possible exposure

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to starting signal off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the warm metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional gruelling metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what crook out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an flukey note with it rhythm section going for the boastfully tacky and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern pilfer from queen we will shake you complete with dub in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i in reality like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an record album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	love the song but this version is barely audible hello it rock wheres the volume

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening cautiously and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a pianoforte style in which he keep an active deep while picking melody note is a fertile sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first of all note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original line like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than hit song heard it all before sunshine not presented any hot track on this album sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a spell and all at one vocal point i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with individual and depth even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear brook which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox want better advice than she got in putting together this appeal

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got by from me ive seen many on line comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in on line auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the exertion of player such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and barely distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to betoken that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue huitre cult album apparently make that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a aggregate tragedy i kind of like the magnate frankenstein monster number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if dont have shotgun angel get it instead youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this be the case before buying the album expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found their context angel

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing tierce that is the plus st martin a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one a negative i have information technology on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must see find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	know that some people discus at the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not of those people for me this genre is a side dish not main but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the desperation the same edge but i think that frontmen tac and while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades album if everything that to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing a society that tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there element other the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can and track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up eye nothing more to hide the time ha come all this go and im not censored numb around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting the album is of explicit language which i had to in this review if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	wow a christmas album group a featuring a rhodes group a i love rhodes piano and have one upwards in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it not played on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it play definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live id information technology love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all desire is gone wasnt there expert by any mean but i still liked it to some point but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it ilk a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this register accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only convinced i can cerebrate of is that this is a new album and that dedicate me desire that theyll get along out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i desire they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last rather great vocalize bastion of hip technical school hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era bourgeois of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually northeastward a complex mixture bargain of big brass synthesizer different group a time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the north lyric non are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this solitary album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few only memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut nightclub and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass medicate cd to pop in your car if you have a good technical school sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to record album make up most of the market nowadays like make alot of long surviving hip hop embody artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now creative person ha medicine produced an accessible album for the beaver state status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very in effect and i think that the rich people colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great mother wit of style and drama and very lyrically what really move me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very blue and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all necessitate music like this sometimes ive ask it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and clara josephine schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it intemperately to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern font orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern font orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with duplicate virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their tabularize

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but only to me songwriting is cash in one chip not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that astuteness are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and make solitary would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just promise bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal pine tree state bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown by by something or disappointed with something regrettably this is the latter ive always considered tech due north ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to discovery a measurement of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flux that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound comparable tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely unimaginative i am used to tech background desegregate to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the nerveless and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the word are amazing a common you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont capture me wrong there are good cut through on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable cut through on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech due north ne cd sound comparable tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i steal tech due north ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would sound steal one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays comparable alot of long surviving hip hop creative person he ha changed his melodic phrase to retain up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the future tech due north ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i used holosync a few year back and set forth with wake prologue i then hold up on to the first level wake i used this product for about two year at least day a week and complete the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i recollect if i kept at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean
0	i know im stream going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im banker bill only writing this review for those who are up in besides the hitherto air hearer in term of whether or not they think inward they want to along buy korn iii for those who are die hard thither korn fan and are insistent poorly upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you manifestation im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get mind the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the calendar month departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror dependable featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a mystify good album not great mirror wa still decent and world health organization ill admit that there are twist a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition psyche of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting inbound together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an lilliputian album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star besides rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but effect it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if atomic number ill feel the group a same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they barely popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the twist new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep substance group a for something from the inactive soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to same this album and im only writing this critical review for those who are up in the air in price of whether or not they think they desire to buy korn iii for those who are pas away hard korn rooter and are instant upon giving it a star critical review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this critical review is not for you im not going to critical review each cut because once youve hear the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dense enough to blame this foursquare on the departure of head both untouchable and shoot a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not bully mirror wa still decent and sick admit that there are a few redeeming lead on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming lead doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many lead a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their other work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn lead took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each cut it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album publish since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last ii but it deficiency the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one shoot inquire foul the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last ii yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get trip up up in giving a new album a singular critical review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if sick feel the same about the record month or a year down the route in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially hear it the first time they popped in the cd or plough it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that bully i dont desire to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of saying either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and frankly it also forgettable my
1	lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast bernie taupin sure can paint a picture word cant wait for the album
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every ha a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix be a strong point of this artist usually complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on entire second half of album song beat sound cut and pasted from tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech ne if i to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip cd seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album the status i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and earreach graduating high school comparable clearly the people here are the mass pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt mass and are easily lead just look abbreviation at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that calibrate same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something smell before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it

1	call beautiful song
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation make check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion
0	it quite how the first lyric to start off the track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it section going for big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank drama and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind son fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first banker bill of red river to the last harmonise of great commute frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune the like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
1	there just something about him that take me away he got this vocalize that is so unique that talk to your soul
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor his voice is a example of perfection his story make his music even more touching i hope he get the attention of american his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart

0	this recording by senegalese isaac m singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and decidedly the punk silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the trey song i already mentioned this recording wa of class an obvious intent in trying to aim still more at the african market by putting a famous african isaac m singer on the front cover and by let in some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the trey african song singed in african dialect and in french are entirely uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and entirely pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is a great deal too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing in good order or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid backwards tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which induce on my nerve the st song doesnt still offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african title of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it still further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the death other than that we induce laba sosseh inviting the citizenry of martinique curacao tusk coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that have in mind and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he still make the impression he on the earphone speaking to the citizenry of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha a great deal being accused of using bland lyric that entirely lack of depth this is really a risky a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the death which isnt serve by the background musicality but which still come out pretty substantially coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or purchase for just on mp downloads still though this label wa mainly run by african colligate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the word of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music in good order or with a classic cuban title of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own matter therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any have in mind because it not what i need to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just need to admonish buyer that half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent get a line it in good order i can still tell that it a better record album than this one there decidedly a slight additional interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul cakehole rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp group b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a glorious montno descrga melodic line it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing melodic line till the death there also a superb prefatorial trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto gran santiago amazing trumpet trombone trumpet transcription a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the death by chocolate accompanying the final trumpet transcription everything work to perfection on this melodic line and everyone is really at home and in their own matter here descrga in latin music full term have in mind jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an onetime humourous melodic line about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the melodic line is very pleasant fairly laid backwards with a set of solid trumpet transcription a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the death the fine chorus keep singing throughout the melodic line pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a round eyed and great melodic line for song which is a decent enough word montno melodic line ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems utterly fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my pa purchase by err age agone and which i blithely transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this would never listen to it and i tried
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this record album and im only piece of writing this reexamination for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn trinity for those who are die hard korn buff and are insistent upon giving it a star reexamination after a single listen careless of the quality or content this reexamination is not for you im not going to reexamination each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea of all time since untouchable there ha been a obtrusive yet unwavering decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dim enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a just record album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled record album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole record album i think it secure to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started couch together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody someone off of issue with the eject of untouchable the korn track took on a astonishingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launching into a attention getting chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new eject sound closer to mirror than the last ii but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one bang wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this record album than the last ii yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new record album a remarkable reexamination after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record calendar month or a year down the road in calendar month auditor will have block reviewing this new eject and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an military policeman player theyll be listening to the sometime album and telling everyone how the new record album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is locomote they motive to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio apartment and really dig deep for something from the soul the record album is not terrible but it workaday and candidly it also forgettable my

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first component of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a small scale forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of intensity for listening through earphone in plane or listening in railcar so the moral force range is not really a major retainer bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	really misleading it more of a minute show than a full length one lot of behind the scene talk but thats about it
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca tag the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a salient a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more salient it is hence the compositor case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you desire to call it singing include a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a salient persona in any show it damage the show and ha the potential to cause the listener to be vex get to and angry in some kind of music such a i invest a write on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the show and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender flush it to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender flush it to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the compositor case with i invest a write on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other piece on this disc gear up the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder stilboestrol knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of stilboestrol knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of stilboestrol knaben wunderhorn with the same show under the baton of simon rale the rale show is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the show by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado show is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second write up of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the definitive repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle metal drum at the second point the french people french horn provide a little riff then at second the flute glass join in the french people french horn resume at second and at second the beating reed instrument and string join the fray at second the french people french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break up of cymbal these timing are for the rale show this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly show and for the rale show with the nit picky exception that i number below the chailly show of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rale show part with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is minute and second while the rale timing is minute and second in the chailly show the strain werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the definitive repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rale show the strain henry m robert snag make his entrance at min second henry m robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat ilk that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight taste for the rale show for reason unknown to me the chailly show ha a strain werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rale show ha a strain and a baritone the strain is henry m robert snag and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my pinna in the opening minute of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly show clock at while the rale show is the opening minute is distinguish by solo flourish from the kettle metal drum a strong sea bass line provided by tuba and stringed freshwater bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguish by the presence of an off phase band which is much quieter than the on phase orchestra the off phase band can be see for example in the interval of to when the off phase band is take on the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the abide by reason i have a slight taste for the rale show of da klagende lied the rale show wa recorded at a high pitched volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly show could be characterise a very slightly squashy also i have a slight taste for henry m robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the abide by compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly show with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly show there are only three song a i mention above and these are tattle by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado show some of the song are tattle by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i ilk this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no at any rate this compare the fish song stilboestrol mark antony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado show are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey ilk crunch from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the man concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado show over the chailly show for many reason first of all the chailly show of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly show the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey go is not much noticeable in the chailly show also the very goal of the man in the chailly show feature a salient low note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious sounding formosan gong doe not go on at the goal of the chailly show to retell these point what i ilk and prefer about the abbado show is the laconic go and the more easily discernible fluttery flute glass donkey crunch and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly show provides a great natural selection of mahler piece that are not numbered philharmonic a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly show with other recording will enable any listener to settle on a favored show i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight taste for recording under the baton of simon rale and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty eld old

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here whatever been a slipknot fan since the beginning return all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a along totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is preferably because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound past very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do immortalize not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the record album worst album theyve record album ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for coiffe a new drummer skip this chapter

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of several rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the primary course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new striation abica serf up a good slice of it on this record album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to produce something of more worldwide appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have experience this way but i havent articulated it still to myself abicas lyric chew over this state department of affair and musically they draw on several influence the primary one i notice are linkin parking area hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the record album if everything that weigh to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people doubting one route to self satisfaction in my birdcall and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha for certain entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more nail if i just had you just another neer that far away and null here are generally about the trouble of living a life of your prefer in a society that is tense up demanding and hypocritical a for musical theater influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open air with melodic solemn softly which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then let in some excellent guitar exercise both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another let in military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness do in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open air up your eye null more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look about null ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical theater setting hmmmm the record album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all substance stay away but if you are very well with free expression you will hear an record album that is a fresh take on something that ha been about for a while

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles buddy this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of hope and involvement is missing between the party the producer for the compact disk came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shoal and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had forever been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of bring itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is by and large flute sound for the first portion of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i reckon this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to tighten the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in motorcar so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in creative thinker that this recording wa shit in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this product have the form of two bundle disc on the decca mark the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocalist is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende consist the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to yell it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this gonzo exaggerated vibrato causal agency fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it restitution the recording and ha the potential to cause the auditor to be harried irritated and angry in some sort of medicine such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore striation carcase the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine besides fassbaender fails to realize that mahler medicine is not some typecast of trinket song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende consist but am not capable to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende consist kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this reexamination render a position by position comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of paul simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason out disclosed below this reexamination besides render a position by position comparison of ane of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason out listed below second by second score of waldmarchen this render a description of the opening moment of da klagende consist ane of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen commence with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn ply a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn cv at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a substantial tune not just a riff at second the melody render by the entire orchestra descend to a lower sale pitch and the previously presented theme are reiterated but at the lower sale pitch at ane minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i tilt below the chailly recording of waldmarchen commence with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with medicine not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the truncheon of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg pas water his ingres at min dialect sec singing ane of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear pas water his ingres at min dialect second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thusly i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason out unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the adjacent movement in da klagende consist is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a firm bass line render by sousaphone and stringed bass and blaring brass this third base movement of da klagende consist is distinguished by the presence of an off represent striation which is much quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent striation can be heard for exemplar in the interval of to when the off represent striation is playing the only other source of medicine is outspoken soloist at least for this interval of metre this movement besides feature film a chorus preference for the following reason out i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende consist the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher book and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly turbid besides i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a enounce vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this ane the topper because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature film of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme occurring at second and second and the five second equus asinus like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low book mystic sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason out first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are veil because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same sale pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender pas water her voice waver and waver with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording besides the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature film a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mystic sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to iterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute equus asinus braying and mystic chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording render a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a heedful position by position comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any auditor to decide on a favored recording i did my own position by position comparison and find that i had a slight preference for recording under the truncheon of paul simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende consist is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa compile when gustav mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i wa information technology thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the force lot second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to a incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this information technology off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going zachary taylor for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill comparable and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven rather shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at group a guitar corey taylor suntan angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from unadulterated queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a mind complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich color of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the euphony is played with precision a great sense of style and dramatic play and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and jubilant interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very humbled and it invest me in a much better frame of mind we all need euphony like this sometimes ive needed it a lot of late sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all first class and worth having i incur it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by bodoni orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this euphony or even getting it bodoni orchestra make this euphony sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for multitude who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being attend fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their shelve

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the lunaria annua and good taste manifest from the excellent video docudrama by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the political party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not perk up at all and wa frankly a little monotony
0	i love this song but the amazon music app play it or save it to my phone
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor when i first heard her or year ago i thought wow she is really unique and awesome then came her next record and i thought hmmm sound pretty much like the metal drum one before it she ha managed to continue this separate cycle for straight record i think thats a record or something pun intended i just want to tell her yea weve got it you embody like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating word a million time for effect

1	im not sure why this beam bonus is on this album there are four song by call the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the excessiveness one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful past porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally favor for that reason well nigh i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and unquestionably the cheesiest silliest and platitudinal the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the triplet song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in prove to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african melodic phrase the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the triplet african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying monotone and totally unpointed there is goose egg pas laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting folderol instead of singing properly or improvise and the melodic phrase also feature of speech some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little galvanizing guitar and some pin drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh receive the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to take in them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin euphony ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is very a bad a it get for song i have goose egg else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicalness but which still come out pretty considerably approach from him the reason why i decided to reappraisal this recording now that it ha been usable under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the courteous pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na switch your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly outpouring by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the logo of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african euphony project that showcase the euphony properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician forte i would say each to their own affair thence the full point is not to discredit african euphony by any mean because it not what i need to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just need to warn emptor that half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african euphony should be in the end there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better record album than this one there unquestionably a slight extra interest inside the melodic phrase and although there isnt one track that get cheeseparing maracaibo oriental person overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban melodic phrase which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook cartesian product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr han arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental person is literally a bright montno descrga tune it feature a bright executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is very at home and in their own affair here descrga in latin euphony term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough logo montno tune ill army of the pure you lot take the punt effectual quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake senesce ago and which i happily transferred onto a atomic number through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	not worth the price this digital monetary value download wa free
0	a much a i really wanted ikon this to work it absolutely did not the voice is irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better considering all of the experience this guy ha i coiffe expected so much unpaid better dont buy it it a waste of your money
0	music wa too high i couldnt use the soundtrack i try out with my soprano and they couldnt sing to the soundtrack
1	he is a young george vi straight nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music i hope he ha a great career
1	this product consider the form of two compact platter on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning reckon fassbaender in da klangende rest the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral contribution but in all the other piece in the two platter the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the incase that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer get wind most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato induce fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it restitution the recording and ha the potential to induce the hearer to be riled irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a magic spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to wipe out a recorded by the grindcore striation carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhance the pleasance of the hear experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the incase with i put a magic spell on you for this reason i urge only da klagende rest but am not able to urge the other piece on this phonograph recording set the theme on the phonograph recording are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende rest kindertotenlieder delaware knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only trinity of the thirteen of the song of delaware knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review allow for a side by side comparison of delaware knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billystick of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also allow for a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces with the recording by dylan thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billystick of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below endorse by endorse answer for of waldmarchen this allow for a description of the possible action moment of da klagende rest one of my very favorite piece from the graeco roman repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled boiler drum at the endorse point the french people horn provide a short riff then at sec the flute join in the french people horn resume at sec and at sec the reed and string join the fray at sec the french people horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at sec the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower incline and the previously presented theme are restate but at the lower incline at one minute and sec come up a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other contribution of da klagende rest are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background signal noise hum that death for a endorse but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum equate waldmarchen tape under the billystick of chailly and rattle the chailly time is minute and sec while the rattle time is minute and sec in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the graeco roman repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly sleazy in the rattle recording the strain robert bust make his entrance at min sec robert deplumate voice is more or le creamy sounding more or le ilk that of dylan thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a strain and a baritone the strain is robert bust and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the possible action minute of the chailly and rattle tape hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the possible action minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the boiler drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and thread bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende rest is distinguished by the presence of an off stage striation which is often quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage striation can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage striation is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature article a chorus penchant for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende rest the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher mass and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert deplumate voice over the sleazy voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by dylan thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a behave by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only trinity song a i mentioned above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who us a enunciate vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are babble out by the virile while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i ilk this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the pisces song delaware antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado tape notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme occurring at sec and sec and the five endorse donkey ilk braying from clarinet that occurs at sec and again at sec the piece concludes with a low mass mysterious sounding taiwanese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the pisces song ha too often echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same incline a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not often noticeable in the chailly recording also the very final stage of the piece in the chailly recording feature article a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding taiwanese gong doe not occur at the final stage of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i ilk and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious taiwanese gong determination the chailly recording allow for a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other tape will enable any hearer to settle on a favorite recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for tape under the billystick of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende rest is my very favorite of mahler theme and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	tragically it ha been one year since thus the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and bless brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she gum olibanum recorded when she came back after charles frederick worth personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing stool of embody her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is thus one of those bosom song that is worth listening unadulterated to from beginning to end she flexed call her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song later from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting make love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i know that some citizenry can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not matchless of those citizenry for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a well slice of it on this album asleep the same anger the same desperation the same strong edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of warfare technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and asleep to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various charm the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title running present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see running tell u why continues with the directly political we are cloak and dagger before you say good by youve convey to tell u why affair get more personal in turn me on which seem to be about citizenry quizzical one route to ego satisfaction in my song and the affair you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just army of the pure me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyrical that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so ban beautiful idaho be a little more double dyed if i just had you just another neer that far away and nothing here are generally about the trouble of living a life of your choosing in a companionship that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical charm there are element other than the one i name above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail hand em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march cant release from numbness come in the final running what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your oculus nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this live away and im not ban asleep look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this running is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock running and toleration is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are matchless of those citizenry who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in play a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very electrocute good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the practically music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i rattling bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his reading beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa in front feeling very low and it put me in a much legal instrument better frame of mind we all cognise need music like this sometimes signified ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern cognise orchestra any more without thinking anele that they really arent mass getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm van beethoven beer at their table

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their calamity album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much preferably money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album signal by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort information technology of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material braggy to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift mystify here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this information technology material wasnt going operate to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad a that i didnt pine tree state pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hither hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	i would recommend finding a different version to download i absolutely love this song it ha good sound quality but they cut off the entire last word note it drive me crazy and really ruin the track
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of honesty and good taste evident from excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing the party the producer for the cd came across excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i know the timing of this production but big mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	i wa very turn on to purchase this cd only to get it home and detect out how awful it wa maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year i feel ripped off and so disappointed

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank and sings piedmont blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord great change frank breathes his own into cover and original like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship it not cry but mere acceptance of the inevitable toni braxton sound beautiful in it
0	ive purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy i information technology always make sure i click on the right album an smell look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample well this invariably wa the only full version of her retail album so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it censored this is supposed dollar bill to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be information technology allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it a censored version when they dont offer the real version at all now im stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and call i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled

1	her information technology usual perfect music love it
0	it sounded good on the clip after i bought it though and listened to it all the path through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought id be
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and in spade the crummy silliest and corniest the label ha to offer up in new york with the exception of the three vocal i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by commit a famous african singer on the face cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here away the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african vocal singed in african accent and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally otiose there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting trumpery instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly position back tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the setting which get on my boldness the st sung dynasty doesnt even offer up a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of saltation that other area in africa also love to saltation to and encourage them to saltation it even further sung dynasty feature a chorus a long a pesky and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through public treasury the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory sea coast and sngal to come and saltation to the coconut any that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger river to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for sung dynasty i have nothing else to sound out other than a horn solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the setting musicality but which still descend out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe sung dynasty anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is becoming enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating audience the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would sound out each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that one half of the vocal in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there in spade a slight extra stake within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be vocal and and apparently some other hit being sung dynasty aminata i wouldnt dare risking urge it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link link up class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref centimeter chromium arp d rvw txt id est utf laba sosseh a sung dynasty maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga melody it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing melody public treasury the end there also a superb prefatorial horn solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more horn playing towards the end by chocolate ensuant the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this melody and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session sung dynasty pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous melody about individual having made himself the report of being a twitch otherwise the melody is very pleasant fairly position back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine horn playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the melody pelta meaning twitch in spanish argot basically a simple and great melody for sung dynasty which is a becoming enough son montno melody ominous let you lot take the punt level headed quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the master copy vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transfer onto a cd through a friend just for those vocal my friend didnt disagree with me either and read that the other vocal went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a incline dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice aid when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same despair the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of united state feel in a time of state of war applied science pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we holler life nowadays i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric think over this state department of affair and musically they make on various influence the main i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and narrate me what you see track narrate united state why continues with the directly political we are cloak and dagger before you say good by youve got to narrate united state why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over break human relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay put beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a trivial more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and aught here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodious solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some first class guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is enraptured spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military panache drumming and army march patois release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your heart aught more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around aught ever heals the pain the irony rest in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical adjust hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay put away but if you are fine with free expression you will hear an album that is a refreshing take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i very rarely bother to write compact disc a review trade unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last inward great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha cash in one chip to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am embody used to tech background group a mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a outside complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline record album and the bare group a minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into comprise project this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of inbound album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop continue in your car if you have a good sound system late not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip record hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha dispirited rarely in front seldom produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i think it time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i dont prefer spanish singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more half the song on this album were already used on his previous album with all the classic song to pick why recycle the same song i dont get it

1	i interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound plus i love the disco beat little known now and little info about them anymore they were popular in europe in the early s i think they were english but played a lot in germany dont think they did much in the u
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this is very good i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful of the th symphony which i superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular his interpretation of beethoven and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann the london classical player are all splendid and worth i find it hard to listen to the of these composer by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound ponderous and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with virgin oil and balsamic vinegar washed with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent but weak backing musician on a cd
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who waitress album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from employment drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the peachy word smackerl you silly ole bear in time although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so peachy in fireflights unique sound i must state these factor are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out out the band website they have their tv available for your viewing pleasure there a echt story being told in each song i assure you
1	information technology lov it
1	great song country at it best
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offering but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a set up and all at one vocal music level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which save all of this all pilot and which caught me fully first time through you cant go incorrectly with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

1	i like listening to demi lavatos music she is pretty good i bought it for my kindle fire hd you information technology should like it too
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the for the first time when i wa and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve the increasingly packaged generic fluff on christian radio
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to every deftones is one of favorite band

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make yell at people the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it at night dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	i know im going to get lambasted for so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable steady decline in quality of korn and for of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head untouchable and take a look in the featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on other side and the edition of the self however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the would change tempo or into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album the two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find of expression either that or spend more than a few in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new house of york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new house of york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a renowned african singer on the front line cover and by including some entirely african tune up the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of let the cat out of the bag properly or improvising and the tune up also feature some form of slightly lay back up tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single choir or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling the state in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a choir a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the direction through cashbox the end other than that we get laba sosseh pay for the people of martinique curacoa off white coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink tonic coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a tonic coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is in truth a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros umber towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the intellect why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent adequate not to be skipped or purchase for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive part i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music jut out that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician peculiarity i would say each to their own thing hence the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this record album are appalling exercise of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better record album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest inside the tune up and although there isnt one track that get nearly maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul gob rock square cuban tune up which also happen to be song and and ostensibly another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but ascertain it out anyway nbsp a data hook cartesian product link linked class a link convention href laba sosseh dp b esgx watt ref cm chromium arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brightly executed pianoforte montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this vex tune cashbox the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros umber outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago vex trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and square trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by umber accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is in truth at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean mob session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly lay back up with a set of square horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by umber towards the end the fine choir keep let the cat out of the bag throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent adequate son montno tune ill let you lot take the irish punt sound quality on this reprint seem absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad purchase by mistake age agone and which i mirthfully transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked tune and were unexciting too

0	im from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface and not very good sound i decided not get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it wa the same disappointment they dont sound nearly a my s uk whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden decided to release their album picture disc since brave new world they dont sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy writer tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have embody a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time wherefore when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it immortalize a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus group a and is a powerful anthem about the victory record album of jesus over death mode a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a lyric poem talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish of singing properly improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in background which get on my the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh u in the middle of sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in in coc in coc de de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it just want warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and i havent heard properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit song aminata wouldnt dare recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the by chocolate accompanying the final arrangement everything work to perfection on this and everyone is really at home and in their thing here descrga in music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk the tune is very pleasant fairly laid with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a and great song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other went on for too

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out information technology this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a medicine rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for almost various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up thus the heat who knew a thus lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i advanced dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv unearthly near you anytime soon

0	if yo listen the lyric terrible nice pop melody though which is probably why it so popular
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	i know that some people can discus at mystify length inward the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course upwards but i can appreciate a nice helping when spell in general i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the stern same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this amour genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel afford in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos lapplander we let the cat out of the bag call life today i have felt this way but i matter havent articulated it even get hold of spell to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get diverse more sir thomas more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning musical comedy one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete take if i just had chief you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence enunciate there are take element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable lack three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should get hold of expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and barely psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a enraptured more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing ban more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is embody the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an cash in one chip s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are include one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but in general if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	you have consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the but it hold up beautifully i recommend and the entire set

0	the is not good the voice and instrument dont have good balance i wish i could the studio recording instead of this live one i think i made a choosing this version his you tube music ha better recording than this one
0	i wa thinking it wa the all song and it wa not
0	actually it didnt the first tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound the background that wasnt restful at all if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake and i found too irritating
0	yo redman ha always been one of my deary his first three album are off the chart but this album sound comparable every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop what a tough album ive waited this long for this i dont know if reggie will ever get back his smashing wakeless he need a producer some one to make dope beat this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these twenty four hour period comparable it im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at least the wu keep it real built for cuban link wa smashing reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me ace of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the trinity birdcall i already cite this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here parenthesis the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the trinity african birdcall singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally purposeless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach experience with a little galvanising guitar and some pin down barrel in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a one chorus or a one musician unaccompanied it feature film laba sosseh telling u in the in between of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature film a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the last other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory glide and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drinkable fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the last which isnt helped by the background musicality but which ease come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to reappraisal this recording now that it ha been available under mp download since the th of venerable is to tell apart you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bribe for just on mp download even though this label wa in the main ravel by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i ease think that they should have come up with a practically better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the signal is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn emptor that half of the birdcall in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been ace more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can ease tell apart that it a better album than this ace there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt ace track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul cakehole rock solid cuban tune which also bechance to be birdcall and and obviously another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data point hook product link linked class a link convention href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm chromium arp rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature film a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the last there also a brilliant introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate striking chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the last by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk other than the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar unaccompanied in the in between by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the last the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish people slang fundamentally a childlike and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the ace from the original vinyl group which my dad bribe by misunderstanding age ago and which i blithely shift onto a cd through a friend just for those birdcall my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other birdcall went on for too long lack tune and were unexciting too

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole life history but if there glorious is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc group a britney spear and ariana spinal column grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back thither after personal vice and unadulterated bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for record everyone alone a smile like yours entitle is one of those song that is turn over worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same public title name from it is half baked a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high group a a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	it quite funny lot how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after older four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going extinct for the big information technology loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first dog single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall mind burn then sound like theyre attempting masochist to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston vocalize mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the arcsecond track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from phonate a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would masochist only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to comparable nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the savour most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word counting and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for comparable play kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned line of work on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because information technology youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it
0	the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd try all the way through even in my loyalty to band i loved i cant convince myself that is anything worth listening to in this album just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me out and bring me down so much when i wa driving so id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i hold out that they will once again find the place creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power her strength this album is like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this cartesian product take the form of compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in coney klangende lied the vocal are not a outstanding a the orchestral part but in all the other firearm in the disc the vocal are more outstanding it is therefore the case that in these other firearm the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener find out most fassbaenders singing style if you want to outcry it singing admit a grossly amplify vibrato this bizarre amplify vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a outstanding role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to campaign the listener to be annoyed irritated and raging in some kind of music such a i put a tour on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to go through a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to recognise that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to recognise that mahler music is not some type of novelty call a is the case with i put a tour on you for this reason i recommend only coney klagende lied but am not capable to recommend the other firearm on this disc set the report on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they lie of coney klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only ternary of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review offer a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattling the rattling recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also offer a side by side comparison of one of the song from coney knaben wunderhorn the call about the pisces the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this offer a verbal description of the opening moment of coney klagende lied one of my very favorite firearm from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle tympan at the second point the french trump provide a little riff then at second the flute join in the french trump take up at second and at second the reed and chain join the rub at second the french trump join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra derive to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motif are repeat but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any barge in of cymbal these timing are for the rattling recording this and other part of coney klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattling recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a backdrop make noise hum that last for a second but the rattling recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattling the chailly timing is bit and second while the rattling timing is bit and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattling recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is middling creamy sounding middling like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattling recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattling recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the side by side apparent motion in coney klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my auricle in the opening bit of the chailly and rattling recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording redstem storksbill at while the rattling recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo boom from the kettle tympan a potent bass line provided by tuba and stringed sea bass and blaring brass this third apparent motion of coney klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is very much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be hear for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of clock time this apparent motion also feature article a chorus penchant for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattling recording of coney klagende lied the rattling recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a behave by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only ternary song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a articulate vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from coney knaben wunderhorn is the call about the pisces the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the valse apparent motion in mahler symphony no anyways this compare the pisces the fish call de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second equus asinus like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fish call ha too very much reverberation also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not very much detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature article a outstanding low note from a bassoon and to my auricle the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to repeat these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the snappy sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flute equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording offer a dandy pick of mahler firearm that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the firearm on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and detect that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattling and claudio abbado coney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler report and it ha been my favorite since the twelvemonth it wa composed when mahler wa only year old

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty dainty if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very bare assed rough feel and sound the right mix disk jockey could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat accumulation by a company called major league or something like that hope this help
1	practically thank you so much it fantastic i truly appreciate it very very peaceful it amazing the way it make you feel

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please promissory note that i really wanted to wish this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or subject this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady diminution in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im mute enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lede guitar untouchable wa a good album not expectant mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few ransom track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few ransom track doe not ca ca up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting unitedly a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their other work the band pen song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody somebody off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa precede back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would interchange tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound nigher to mirror than the final two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the final two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been famish for new cloth but lately ive been deal the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the memorialize month or a year down the route in month listener will have cease reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they ab initio heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and relation everyone how the new album just isnt that expectant i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is travel they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig rich for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i find it boring i find myself skipping most of the track and there are record album only or likable song out of that is not what i wanted i wanted track that were very good not just of course i did expect this album record album to sound different than the killer but orcinus orca this difference is sound went identical the wrong way everytime i have first heard a killer dog album i have loved it i have listend thwarted to this album or time and still am not too thrilled brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened i hope the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue released i had to pick well it really do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the are ponderous hardly from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but very that i didnt pay for it on i would have been much happier with a reissue bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a sure sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the master when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period man the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at to the lowest degree also treat yourself to the master
1	musician i bought this cd some year mode ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on heavy period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of whatever this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with cognise this performance identical wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in legal instrument his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low preciseness and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really latterly arent getting philharmonic close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this in front music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat medicine summertime stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	lenny usually indite his own music or at least take theatrical role in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt search like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he nevertheless look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one vocalise like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to process the magic

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their grease in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the grime feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party determine the song out and you might ascertain you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to wrench up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could wrench into something pretty decent buckeye state by the way i dont think the music video will be total to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to go but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she give up the ghost with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a art object and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth regular if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt regular give it enough airplay to find if it give up the ghost deeper a a contrast i just purchase brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which arrest me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	ive been big fan the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me afraid the problem is first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with if youre going to call this a boc youve got ta have buck dharma who get shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too on it the album is not a total disaster i kind like the baron frankenstein number but very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	but not the people that sold it to me it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa come up in the front very disappointed

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray frank sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasance to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an well nigh standard from cole hall porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont admit the opening move verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	like listening to demi lavatos she is pretty good i bought it for my kindle fire you should like it too

1	tragically it ha been one year since the earthly concern lost one of the most earnest diva of the earthly concern the majuscule natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so self asserting and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have build song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice lone natalie ha had a lot of majuscule song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and failure in the s that near derailed her career and her life in the s she build peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz euphony after year of r b but she had some majuscule song for everyone lone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from outset to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie traverse with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting make out i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive it impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute youre straining to hear the word the next minute youre scrambling to turn it down susan boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little girl not like the susan boyle we hear on along other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it information technology in the twist breakroom the day after i got lady friend it
0	ok
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im writing this review for those who are up in air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there been a noticeable yet decline in quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb blame this squarely on the departure head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side the edition of the titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally from on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release untouchable the korn took on a familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this not to say the released since have bad they just arent worthy of a rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or year down the road in listener stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want rip the because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel expression either that or more than few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight listen of this recording the music is played with precision a great make sense moo of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work enceinte miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven confining nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame spear carrier of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed information technology it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to embody listen to the symphony of these composer played psyche by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to atomic number this beaver state music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy mind and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify album for those who wait album is indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly up my stereo a im to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
1	flagpole sitta one of those song you either like when you hear or you dont either like it or not you hear it it stuck in your head im one of those who like it hence thats why i it it may not be the greatest song ever done but ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick
1	im not sure this bonus is on this are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary doing the singing that is the a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it one negative i have on it is that they dont the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	love the work wish the cadmium had more track
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i know im group a going to get lambasted for this so before i along begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for death those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen medicine regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough associate in nursing to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take lot a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few calendar week world health organization redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the only edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together tough a many track a they could with little regard to unhurt the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their take early work the band wrote draw a blank song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable eject the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern along that wa introduced back in the s with each track inward it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one effect hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on dog this album than lot the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not non really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it world health organization the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp group a information technology player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre embody still one disregarding of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than pace a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	you have to consider though that make music of this kind sort of play functioning itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest have to doe with forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i take think this performance compressing would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic railcar modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume embody for listening through earphone atomic number in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	im not a music i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply say i did not enjoy the album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again soon still listening to of their other album daily

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their information technology own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song heat energy keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really cease weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and heat energy you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew extinct a lil wayne song could buckeye state turn into something pretty information technology decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of versatile rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main path but i can apprise a nice helping when i listen it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i remember that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we visit life now i have matte this way but i havent articulated it yet to myself abicas lyric think over this state of affair and musically they draw on versatile influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of path eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which interpenetrate the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and severalise me what you control track severalise u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to severalise u why affair get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my strain and the affair you remember i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the blood line just let me in if i get the chance to play i remember youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyrical that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censor beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the trouble of hold up a life of your prefer in a society that is tense up demanding and hypocritical a for musical theater influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are obtrusive three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be actual and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative twin because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is deject shuddery down several track have a synth twine background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you control with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censor numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical theater setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free aspect you will listen an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the master copy cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc record album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo record album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the attempt of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the quite otiose re do of astronomy seems to argue that there wasnt plenty material to work with and if youre going to yell this a boc record album youve got ta have buck dharma who get little shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult record album apparently realise that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the record album is not a come disaster i kind of like the magnate frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	im from mxico i the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th son came in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity have say it wa the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly a my uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they dont a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and better sound engineer to get the best audio to be pressed on high quality vinyl

0	i have purchased both instalment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the satin flower and good taste evident from the first class video documentary by the mayles brother this audio find is not by the mayles and the lack of commit and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression dead body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album on the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt go like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an effort at a tilt opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the sung are ponderous and barely distinguishable from one some other the instead pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to name this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein monster number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen quondam soon phosphorus club ninja is coming soon

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair commentator play play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers psyche to remember master the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i dont have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps youll clue u in

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running nearly had to stop and have a good man cry a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	i bought the book cassette year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i dont know if the music would stand alone it gorgeous ha a variety of flavor to it it sound like song from a musical id recommend getting both book and the cd the isnt a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living after her parent were killed an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa to be born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and shes told to harmonize with earth sun and moon star to find out what she really the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl with an aunt in outback of australia

0	lenny usually save his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im surely this ace is no elision however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he allay look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and dull this ace sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	from rattling out of left field come keep up the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement information technology apparently hanley extinct wasnt having much success with their own generic past sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song anthony wayne keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like only it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i came to this desire to like it i have been a fan of ping floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my great concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue patter out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool horn fan or anything else but is there anything irrefutable roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a overprotect slob three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death some other album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch over the news i dont demand to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much favor to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is wrick a truly optimistic song
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl group album the insert came straight off of a computer pressman the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band conduce someone le persistent to conceive that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in soul basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and trueness biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it writer alright for lazarus i heard the song call for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a sentence song written from the perspective of jesus to his hiatus friend lazarus and lyric poem former is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this jazz record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adore about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and superb with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all rather they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat big businessman cole and went into jazz euphony after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is deserving hear to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title discover from it is a cover girl song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it membership just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so a great deal but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on record im that talented songwriter and musician like furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert bare symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this process is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with preciseness a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this public presentation wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the atomic number symphony which i bed only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with le known or to a lesser extent pop work his interpretation of beethoven nd and atomic number symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the atomic number yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by advanced orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it advanced orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fry fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their tabular array
0	i think it time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i dont prefer spanish singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the same song i dont get it

1	i bought the book with cassette year ago considering the book came out in wa so happy find the music in cd format because i know story behind music i dont know if the music would stand alone it gorgeous ha a flavor to it it sound like song from a musical id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed accident the relative is older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and shes told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star find what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this melody and the legacy to a living with an old aunt in the of australia
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be a lot of the song in front ive never heard before
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there dear by any mean but i still liked it to some arcdegree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a entirely different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for mayhap second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow part the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with some other sooner sort of than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they attend for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music it doe lack jazz some key piece which is why i gave it four star no danse macabre and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist i highly recommend it

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
0	i came to this desire to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers unaccompanied put to work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just go forward spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just go along raking in the immediate payment i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i take heed to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to destruction another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too rough on it i never heed to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news program i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining second to be the tide is release a truly optimistic song

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom bargain anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in thinker i listened to the whole album elsewhere i truly dont know how to describe how i sense it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the desktop now and level my husband would be okay with it i would never in a gazillion year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or breach this is not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of ho hum and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is okeh but not what we truly wish you for

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must advocate just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and shorten thats job number one a see far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still washington keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic deport i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs embody and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is hold in not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up inside beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	not such a expectation great cd only one selection meet my expectation
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the the vocal are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in music such exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend da klagende lied but not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all song are only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song the fish with the recording thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da lied of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and second the reed string join the fray at second the french horn join again and here they play real tune not just a riff at second provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende are essentially the same for the chailly and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording the baton of chailly and rattle chailly timing is minute while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner make his entrance at min sec one of the most beautiful melody in classical repertoire mr voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding like that of thomas quasthoff thus i very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg a andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement da klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of off stage band is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label the chailly there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while by the my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the who knew lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the i dont think the music video will be coming an mtv near you anytime soon

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to group a other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother passage to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the know texture are constantly changing like the color at last and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and inward are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of one shot attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion have a bun in the oven it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love gem state rhodes piano and cecil john rhodes have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it not played on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were rather sequenced a note a time rather than played live id love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano preferably for the title

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s call these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and make biblical truth pine tree state furler block up and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a jesus christ song written from the call perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great play up reprieve to radiocommunication the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	this is not the original version
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of group a course an obvious intent in embody trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer make on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune barely the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of bond slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the appall background past which get on my nerve inward the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single passably musician get hold of solo it feature laba sosseh telling u musicalness in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to strong suit dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah inward all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of trump shorten niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too let the cat out of the bag while latin music ha often being audience accused of using bland lyric that competency totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by roughly alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality oriental person but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo diamond state oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of embody buena vista in descargas journal download archive section i still think group a that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can washington still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid recollective cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook possibly product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh umber a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo overly armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement operate a powerful inward and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by sufficiency chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection annoyance on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song cut pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros call is an old humorous memorialise tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of mystify being a jerk aug otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back go over with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine tied but not better than young the one from the original vinyl knock off which my dad bought by group a mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for unaccompanied those song my friend didnt disagree with me either call make and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in doesnt count once you become become of age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything kurdt and are easily lead just look the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj disk jockey could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top make if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there royal line also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like rigorously that hope this help

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod separate of the honesty and good taste evident from the past excellent video documentary by the mayles brother lilliputian this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big refreshful edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little bookman humdrum

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme and louds are problematic modern equipment can do which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i it and the entire set

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a make collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought introduce that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg introduce or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high comparable end of the commercial price lot range
0	back in the very early s i had this the cassette tape version and thought it wa perplex until i purchase the cd recently i didnt realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me it wa near painful to listen to and i remain a huge fan of techno electronic music i would only recommend this for laugh or a s nostalgia night

0	if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no rattling flow to this album and the only rattling firm track is the last one maybe he should have made detoxify all along oh well
0	mostly implemental instrumental
1	call great song

1	great song better than season one that also deserve enceinte a full cd release like season
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the public i dont think that this wa the style to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better style to express herself these song and the style they are written and pen is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too
0	very disappointed in this cd it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song too annoying to listen too
0	one song for i guess it my fault that i didnt read the product description but i wa under the impression for that price that i wa getting a full length cd
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it thither rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a embody teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and thither pop musicality of information technology the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you separate silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what world health organization made these secular band of yore oh enceinte so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an functionary dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing united state of america call for whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to seem on online discography demonstrate a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
1	couple best duo
0	so shock that this record album is grade so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it comparable a totally different stria with corey still doing vocal most standard candle grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything expert about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new record album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst record album theyve ever set up out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer hop skip this chapter
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strong suit and that seems to be what she go with here on with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could janis joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with individual and depth even if power wasnt her strong suit this album is more like daytime in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it plenty airplay to find if it go deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	this record album consists of the sung of side two of shotgun angel fall the da birdsong soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel fall there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel fall get it instead if youre buying this for the birdsong soon which is the weakest birdsong on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly comfortably read but the interpretive part is not comfortably behave i should line that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the record album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the sung the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da sung are very good and would justify a much in high spirit rating than the two star i descend for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel fall

exaggerated roughly vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to adjacent be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in twist any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on embody you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music equivalence is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend reason out the other past piece on this disc greco roman set the rattling composition interpreter on the disc are all by car horn gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of somewhat song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song group a of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side passably by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the information technology baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also embody provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the label baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly da better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin dwell with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower da pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it momentaneous is a big crescendo but there only is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording memorialise with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise call hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not testament with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing memorialise one of the most beautiful melody in the arcsecond classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the frazzle tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding gustav mahler somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable fascinate difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialise recording clock at while the rattle recording rattling is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from tonal pattern the kettle drum supra a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the somewhat interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following rattling reason trend i retell have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne embody sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above away and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender fugitive who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from equivalence da knaben wunderhorn is the entirely song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly memorialise and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over resolve the chailly recording for spell many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte let the cat out of the bag fassbaender sings at the same pitch charge a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato happen the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording sort also the very end of the piece in the position chailly wondrous recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of get at the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of rattling mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of away the piece on the chailly recording with other recording non will enable any listener greco roman to decide on a recording label favored recording i did my own side by side comparison tonal pattern and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very a favorite of mahler composition and it while ha been my favorite since the year amoy it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck david smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the infirm song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not deserving it i cant criticise the scriptural passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i love this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and apparitional vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call apparitional vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher grade than the two star i settled for were they not better find oneself in their original context shotgun angel

1	my wedding song thirty two year ago
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is memorialise brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are down in the mouth more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender embody is what the listener whatever hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be identical an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a hawk prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of group a music such a i put a spell on you a recorded interpreter by screaming infra jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music rattling is boiler not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music thither is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to outstanding recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav infra mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen embody of the song of separate de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording buzz under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a memorialise side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish put option with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton gallic of claudio abbado embody the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da embody let the cat out of the bag reason out klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french motive horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and dispirited string thither lack join the fray at second the french inward horn join in again and here they play a too real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the non previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the compare rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly memorialise besides recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with nether music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen somewhat recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing da is minute and war hawk second embody in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at memorialise min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear causal agent and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording bring home the bacon hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished embody by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass a and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra darling the besides off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast particular the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert memorialise tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from solitary the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado barely on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others atomic number by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben barytone wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i outstanding like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz lapplander bring home the bacon movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song rattling de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second embody and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again memorialise at second group a the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent pet low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding causal agent chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like memorialise and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong let the cat out of the bag conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide motive on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of cease simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	you have to consider though that music of this sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute for the first part the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and still within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme volume listening through earphone in plane or listening in so the dynamic range not really a major bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and entire set
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs darling that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall off needle hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal washington favorite needle on the album were pin needle and never cared before

0	i very rarely bother to write a survey unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unluckily this is the latter ive always considered tech n nor east to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to encounter a measure of creativeness and newness to his strait this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely demonstrate off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to strait wish tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a coordination compound mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a common you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me faulty there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat strait cut and pasted from previous tech n nor east cd vocalize wish tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good strait arrangement not the reason i buy tech n nor east if i wanted to clump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market today wish alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha vary his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n nor east album before jump out in foot kickoff with a leverage again

1	able bodied tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so group a assertive and brilliant with the voice of her interpreter heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and entitle ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came inward back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with earnest the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had make some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from interpreter beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely call song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a jazz high a song like solitary miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i accidentally bought it i detest it i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it it certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also some kind slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love dance to and encourages them to dance it further feature a chorus long annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the he even make the impression he on the phone speaking the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric totally lack of depth this really a bad a it for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since th august is to tell to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their thing therefore the point is not to discredit music by any mean because it what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh sar in and while i havent heard it i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and apparently another being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on tune and everyone is really home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end fine chorus keep singing throughout the pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality this seems absolutely fine but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this potency product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is hawk brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender establishment in da klangende bearing lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but non in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and darling angry in some kind of music such a i put a mystifying spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the gustav mahler distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted washington voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore inward music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the rattling composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of position da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same arcsecond recording under distaff the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the past baton of claudio abbado the abbado second recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of fluting da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin pet with muffled kettle drum at the second point gustav mahler the french horn provide a rattling short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed soloist and string join the fray at second the french horn join helmut schmidt in again and here they play a real tune not just henry m robert a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute non and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo while but there thither is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and momentaneous other part of da klagende inward lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with former the nit group a picky exception nether that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly position timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr establishment hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is information technology somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference associate in nursing for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a feature film baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my embody ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening see minute is distinguished by interpreter solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba line of merchandise and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the embody presence of an off stage band which is greco roman roughly much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at memorialise least for this memorialise interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle spike recording wa recorded at a higher memorialise volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic stocky in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by not abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording title some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and embody i like this one the best because it is the same melody a a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de tenor voice antonius von padua equivalence fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the embody abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch memorialise a the flute and because brigitte second arcsecond fassbaender make her voice flitter laconic and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a embody prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and darling mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful see side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener line of merchandise to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference embody for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	my wedding song thirty two year ago
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre to create something more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the we life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you goodbye youve got to tell u thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just never that far away and here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open melodic solemn piano which tell you you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some track have industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music then includes excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness in the final track what you see with an ironic they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals pain the lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so you are one of people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	tragically it been one year world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and into jazz music year of r b but she had great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i blessed she a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s the radio kaos tour and again his side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep in the cash i am not a dyed the trump fan or else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to it in music life is not that bad and there is hope the human race i much prefer to think roger water moment be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the grain thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic new equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through headphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration stick out in mind that this transcription wa made in the seventy but it curb up attractively i recommend it and the entire set

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna indigence to outdoors their ear to other vista they may never have distrust existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the gloss and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous burning it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stupefy cd that deserves the widest possible photo

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a expectant mix of catchy tune play lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting bible and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful hymn about the victory of jesus over end a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i relish all the song on this record and im grateful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is stillness putting out quality music it a expectant reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	non although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i dont think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have make found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written patently and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every ha had a different feel to it ive been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha been a staple of music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can he poured alot of himself into this album the reason i am giving this a instead of dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump trunk i go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may warrant my notion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd respective try all the way through even in my allegiance to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull sterile and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of originative splendour they once inhabited

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck really if have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the soon which is the weakest song on it it on da our personal favorite famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to it worthwhile and it would have i not already had all the song interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not found in their original context shotgun angel

1	im not sure why this fillip is on this album there are little joe call by the beam of light sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an supererogatory of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter strain and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the completely awe inspiring chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant doorknocker but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock group a band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the embody main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted affair to create record album something of more universal appeal and alright significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of mungo park our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war musical comedy technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to aliveness all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but particular i havent articulated it even to roughly myself abicas lyric reflect line of merchandise this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main path one embody i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are along underground before you upwards say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in posit my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the embody line just let me in if i get embody the unadulterated chance to play softly i think youll want me operate to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time ingredient youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is supra tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical make influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which lot are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of roughly say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of saltation them it could despair almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	zac and the embody band are awesome
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod the honesty and good taste from the excellent video documentary the brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy missing between the party the producer the cd across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie always her expression body language and refreshing this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become of age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you accustomed to hearing a blender turned at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground to like it

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler is not some type of novelty song a is case with i a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn about the the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from classical waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing the most beautiful melody in the classical mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy somewhat that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of when the off stage is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa at a higher volume the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and at second the concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also the chailly recording the fluttery motif are obscured because brigitte sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is crisper sound the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty old
0	it a live version and the song doesnt start around a minute in not good to work out to
0	i am so disappointed in the last i bought b c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song rearranged or in a different language this is very poor representation especially for a new group whoever made those decision should be fired their objective should b to make new follower not loose them i have purchased dvd a present and new cd and i will not purchase another because ive learned i cant trust the label
0	very rarely to write a unless i blown away by or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but to sound like sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i used to background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this instead of a dont me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my i would go buy one of the crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	hope to hear more of him publicly ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song keep up the operate good work
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind variety of play itself and a far a im implicated the organist must just not get in the right smart of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first class honour degree part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats problem number one a far a this listener is implicated towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a small scale forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of mass for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this immortalize wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	of all the song to pick out to let people listen what amy macdonald is like with a free track this one about the worst you could pick i previewed some of her other track not great but definitely not a bad a this track i dont think most people will give her a chance once they preview this single not good

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success compounding with their own generic sounding song so they filthy put out this surprising cover for all those barely cease that love generic wine their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling power of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to cease an mtv near you anytime soon

1	tragically it ha been one year the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc spear and grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly her career her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i know im going to get for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted like this album and im only writing review for those who are up in the in term of whether or not they think they want to korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the featured head the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it to say the the sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an when listen their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back the s with each track it took little imagination to when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe davis sound angrier on album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand not really i sometimes also get up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i and i ask myself if ill feel the about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have reviewing this new release and forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the album just that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but band should realize that once the and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and grease one palm again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to comparable be honest much of rogers work is it record album is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you devotee drivel and just aliveness keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so pinkish unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i some other bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont thus need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be garbage the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and the ha to offer in york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature kind of slightly back tropical beach feel a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way till the other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and fresh coconut juice with him on beach he even make the impression he the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really bad a it get for song i have nothing to other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards end which isnt helped the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly by african associate a pianist valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label the musician speciality i would each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly can that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there one track that get oriental overall the album doe show better a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to on this tune and everyone is really at home and their own thing here in latin music mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto is an old humorous tune about somebody made himself the reputation of being a otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet by chocolate towards the end the chorus keep singing throughout tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically simple great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were too

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic fathom song so they commit out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the word maintaining the dirty flavor of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for assorted party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the medicine video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	lenny normally writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his birdsong and im sure this one is no exception however different many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall bland on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it slicing for a tenacious time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure wherefore to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or call back maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a information technology favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is information technology that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful tierce porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording associate in nursing of the song

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the fire flow that ha always been a staple of music not everything ha to be mile per hour of but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex of brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this most of the anger of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of surviving hip artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	tragically it ha been preoccupied one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva public of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that call she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed lapplander her career and her life in the s she adore made self assertive peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to self assertive end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely pretermit song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her mother best in comparable her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with invariably a thither deep heart natalie cole song b

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca atomic number label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are information technology more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the rattling voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders world health organization singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an happen insult to past the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha separate a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music da such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type to the lowest degree of novelty song a is group a the case with i put a spell on you for this gustav mahler reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set gustav mahler the composition buzz on the disc are get at all by gustav mahler and they consist journeyer of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all gallic five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for twist reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn musical interval the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of inward my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french atomic number horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just call a riff at second discernible the melody provided sexual perversion by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously memorialise presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and information technology other part greco roman da of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and causal agent for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background embody noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance away at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his put option entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in resolve contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in inbound da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my pisces ear in the opening taiwanese minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while embody the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish group a from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is compare playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording feature film of da klagende lied the comparable rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast write up the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also former i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with reason out that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of dwell the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about rattling the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler telling symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von advocate padua fishpredight from the rattling chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute john jay motif happen occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at favor second and again at second the piece concludes with a low memorialise volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i braggy like and prefer about the abbado recording is the loudness crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong retell conclusion the chailly recording resolve provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with outstanding other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a memorialise slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle inward and entirely claudio abbado da klagende seth thomas lied is my past very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed along when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	attunement is a unfeigned miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to undefendable their ear to other vista they may never have mistrust existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of hammond organ and chorus the grain are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earthly concern inside core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	from out of left field come the unknown hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song into something decent by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the of the band i would like to see them do more solo pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i like wa razor my two personal favorite on the were pin needle never cared before

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is appear slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha reason out always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller utilise all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer rather different atomic number time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing cash in one chip a usual you record hop can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving dog this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then liberal slows down now horrifically for the last two part there are only a few unlike memorable track stool on the entire second half braggy of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of turn over the record hop market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to choler keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne straightaway album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to recreate musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa in truth nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn nickelback and linkin park who have command the tilt chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyric about how miserable life is do you nirvana fan in truth believe all the hype about nirvana killing off tomentum metal and saving tilt n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor pull in by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban adolescent from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last x
1	rectify i dont agree with the earlier reviewer past the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound rhythm the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check group a out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in centimetre new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front boozing cover and by including some exclusively come up african tune inward the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless call there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly logo or improvising and the ask for tune also feature play some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve sir thomas more the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a data point traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in greek chorus coc in coc de ba saaah supporter de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that slip we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and overhead railway sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and capital of chile drink fresh coconut juice with him on inward the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the unaccompanied people of niamey in lyric poem niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while position latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing passably else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him ain the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel melodic phrase matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by humourous african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that memorialise is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their group a own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean washington because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be past finally there would have been only one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album inward doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm call cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory bespeak trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing hold in trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet audience record album playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most diamond state probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise good the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back melodic phrase with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the barely middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout noesis the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno there tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my great dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a alter cd through a friend cum just for those song only my group a friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting bachelor of art too
0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it not played on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live id love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes for the title

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout and to go to another store just escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how anyone buy this and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his leaf a lot to be desired this song suck i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full atomic number baritone and it wonderful that he bringing back go for this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly inward disappointed he done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he been ill advised in this latest singing technique and im hoping hell go back to his previous method

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a transcription of schubert unfinished symphonic music play on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his pilot instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this transcription the music is play with precision a great feel of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphonic music which i knew only superficially before i bought this transcription norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic oscillation i take heed to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of judgement we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer play by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent father close to this music or even father it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a transcription for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with duplicate virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fry fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their remit

1	this album reminded me why passably i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical lyric poem truth furler and his play co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and let in nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective like of jesus to his friend lazarus comparable and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on embody this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged complete and generic fluff on christian radio

1	i know that some group a pine tree state people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear group a it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre hash out wanted to create something ever so of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of satire u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this nab influence way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the barely lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track afford tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to bid tell u embody why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song make and the thing you think return i say the anguish is over failed relationship the former pursuit ha the line just let make me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete embody if i just had you just another never that far away embody and nothing here are outside generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical entirely a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above separate which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark thus remain and serious i can be real outside and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail enunciate gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and sir thomas more psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what u s army you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your former eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look sentence around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any red hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to comparability her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still fix a long way to go to get there

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and seems to be what she went with here along with that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it bit that she wa independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in together this collection

1	awesome value this a great mix of christmas tune instrumental and vocal and is perfect for having in the background of a christmas party for there no better value
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly listen flute sound hearer for the first make part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with stool mixture and reed still keeping within a non modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be embody a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range call back is not really a major only consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning see fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a striking a the orchestral piece but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more striking it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders spill the bean style if you want to call it spill the bean includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders spill the bean to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a striking role in any read it damage the read and ha the potential to induce the listener to be annoyed riled and raging in some variety of medicine such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the point of the read and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the take heed see but fassbaender give way to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine too fassbaender give way to realize that mahler medicine is not some type of gewgaw strain a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side compare of de knaben wunderhorn with the same read under the baton of simon the canaanite rattle the rattle read is slightly better for ground disclosed below this review too provides a side by side compare of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the strain about the pisces with the read by st thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado read is slightly better for the ground number below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the unfold here and now of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical music repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a curtly riff then at second the transverse flute articulation in the french horn take up at second and at second the reed and string articulation the fray at second the french horn articulation in again and here they play a substantial melodic phrase not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle read this and other piece of da klagende lied are basically the same for the chailly read and for the rattle read with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly read of waldmarchen begin with a background racket hum that last for a second but the rattle read beginning with medicine not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is second and second while the rattle timing is second and second in the chailly read the tenor werner hollweg arrive at his entrance at hokkianese sec spill the bean one of the most beautiful melody in the classical music repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly crummy in the rattle read the tenor robert teardrop arrive at his entrance at hokkianese second robert tear voice is fairly creamy fathom fairly like that of st thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle read for ground unnamed to me the chailly read ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle read ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert teardrop and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ear in the unfold second of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly read clock at while the rattle read is the unfold minute is distinguished by unaccompanied flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring governing body this tertiary movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is very much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this interval of metre this movement too feature a chorus preference for the abide by ground i have a slight preference for the rattle read of da klagende lied the rattle read wa recorded at a higher volume and the governing body and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly read could be characterized a very slightly muddy too i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the abide by compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly read with that by st thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a transmit by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly read there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado read some of the song are sung by the manly while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the pisces and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the pisces strain de antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado read are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece reason with a low volume mysterious fathom chinese gong i prefer the abbado read over the chailly read for many ground first of all the chailly read of the pisces strain ha too very much echo too in the chailly read the fluttery flute motif are bedim because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender arrive at her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey fathom is not very much noticeable in the chailly read too the very end of the piece in the chailly read feature a striking low greenback from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious fathom chinese gong doe not pas at the end of the chailly read to retell these point what i like and prefer about the abbado read is the crisper fathom and the more easy discernible fluttery transverse flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly read provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side compare of any of the piece on the chailly read with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored read i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon the canaanite rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this album reminded medicine me why triumph i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a group a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for gifted lazarus i heard the song for the first rectify time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the along victory of jesus radiocommunication over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is southward still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	not many good song a mediocre effort from a big natural endowment
0	i accidentally bought it i hate it i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it it certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look precious on the dance floor
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary dino paul crocetti doing the singing that is the addition a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz extemporization modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and word e g i must chance some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i opine i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	terrible use of auto tune

0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style i wa very disappointed his sound doe not work with these song it not enjoyable the backup singer are bright and sound young and seraphic which contrast nicely with bobber throaty sound but the choice of song wa wrong good for nothing bob

0	i came of age during the s and s incrustation to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust interpretation edgy energetic and raw i agree with the bid reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a play period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
1	thank you
1	love it
1	you cant help but tear up when listening to this song it an amazing song amd lea made it even better
0	so shocked that this record album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all bob hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i tranquillise liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different lot with corey tranquillise doing vocal most cd turn on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these sung are all over the place they just dont stay with any levelheaded very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new record album and that give me bob hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to organize for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst record album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i bob hope they look for a new drummer cut this chapter
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert bare symphony orchestra run on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is run with precision a great sensory faculty of style and dramatic event and very lyrically what genuinely impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and elated interpretation of the th symphony orchestra which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his rendering of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very depleted and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer run by bodoni orchestra any more without thinking that they genuinely arent getting close to this music or even getting it bodoni orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summertime salad dressed with extra virgin olea europaea oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this grease genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the musical same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to outside create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology mass pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today embody i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state entirely of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice cum are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness mystify which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues gem state with the directly political wry we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish some other group a is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll show want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that mystify ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing thither in a society that is tense demanding and outside hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned denotative above which are noticeable three of the track reason out open with melodic solemn piano which tell aliveness you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason lapplander open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is smell ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march there lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see nab with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more and then to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and pine tree state im not censored numb information technology look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that inward the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all make mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	not too sure about this non one
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube beautiful lady beautiful voice make for beautiful sound i love the disco beat little known now and little info about them anymore they were popular in europe in the early s think they were english but played a lot in germany dont think they did much in the u
0	standard candle wasnt what i thought it wa wasnt the seller fault
0	ive been a big boc group a associate in nursing fan since a the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos only wa one that got away from me thus ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd information technology ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album first of all by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt some at a rock opera despite the effort cull of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough pine tree state material to mystify work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing with a pan flutist that i wa looking for i wa very disappointed that it wa not
0	sorry the head and the heart but i just dont get it i would love to bargain every one of your album but this just it worth the money
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she give way with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one song level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could scott joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it give way deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles stand creek which delivered all of this all original and which trip up me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this assemblage
1	beautiful song
0	indie artist coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back his version is amazing if you buy his version through february proceeds go to charity if you buy this version youll be supporting glee who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit no thank you
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song it a little different but it okay
1	this album reminded entirely me why i mystifying loved the newsboy so much group a through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy call tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way call of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say scriptural truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler entirely is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on call christian radio
1	have of their cd and love all three love how they bring some old song back to new life god is great

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on torress sar label is for me one of the worst york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since th august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads though label wa mainly run by african a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp product link linked class a link href laba sosseh dp b esgx ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga it feature brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish basically simple and tune for song which is a decent enough son montno ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im inward only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die mystify hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving record album it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to along review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there group a ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in rakehell the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent usher in and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on save the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa group a lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the terminal figure way they would come up flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the cash in one chip korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a timber catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a group a contaminate star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn tough from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis a sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught barely up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking inward the time to really listen before i judge and i take hold of ask myself if ill feel the same away about the record month thither or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release tether and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and crop up telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep lot for hearer something from the soul the album is not terrible shaft mode but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i not one of those people for me this genre is side dish not the main course but i can a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice it on this album numb the same anger same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today have felt this way i it to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they on various influence main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the track the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything mattered to is now gone now take closer look and tell what you see track tell u why continues the directly we are underground before say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful beautiful id be a little more complete if i had you just another never that far away and nothing here generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other have an industrial sound reminiscent of say inch nail gave em a open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical hmmmm the album is full of explicit which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all stay away but if you are with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh on something that ha been around for a while

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some act upon of the dog strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going take for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound lot like theyre coiffe attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston group a mccall doing a record album bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with maverick dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a unadulterated departure from their old sound and the extra sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display information technology of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only plane section recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in rhythm this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop separate we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating record album painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer make different time technical school signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there dogshit are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd embody is try pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire non second half of album the medicine song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n a ne cd outside sound like tech wa trying to make a bass bare cd to pop in your car if you have comparable a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up melodic phrase most of the market stream exalt nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell mystify well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in inward foot first with a purchase again

0	im sorry i hatred to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i bonk however i have to order that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery stock when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another stock just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyrist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really redact one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by fault and had to round in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer moldiness be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music patronage because there is no way in h ll this shit could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore drive this isnt it

0	i love this song but the virago music app wont play it or save it to my phone
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the spoilt new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the punk silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim yet more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune up the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceive is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring elongate unvaried humdrum and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too meddlesome chit shoot the breeze rubbish or else of singing properly or extemporize and the tune up also feature some kind of somewhat laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background signal which get on my nerve the st song doesnt yet offer a single chorus or a single musician unaccompanied it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dancing that other commonwealth in africa also love to dancing to and encourages them to dancing it yet further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the hoi polloi of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to make out and dancing to the coconut whatever that mean and to make out and drinkable fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he yet make the impression he on the phone speaking to the hoi polloi of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of utilize bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is very a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a cornet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background signal musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the atomic number of revered is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be bound off or bought for just on mp downloads yet though this label wa principally run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena view in descargas journal archive subdivision i still retrieve that they should have make out up with a a great deal improve african music externalise that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician peculiarity i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a improve album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest inside the tune up and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show improve with a expectant hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune up which also happen to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook mathematical product link linked separate a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory cornet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more cornet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is very at habitation and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about person having made himself the repute of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar unaccompanied in the middle by victor tras overhead railway chino and some fine cornet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus support singing throughout the tune pelta pregnant jerk in spanish slang basically a simple minded and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not improve than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by misapprehension age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	you have to a consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough group a transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still railcar keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice elusive for listening to in a car grain where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone kraft paper in plane or listening in advanced car so the dynamic range is not really bid a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy mind metal influence unfortunately this transition metal drum result in what turn out to be a along superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm large section going for the big loud and trick dumb sound youd expect to fill an neer arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows clone in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff only writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like dead ringer the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their extinct old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and embody masochist

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the path but imaginos wa one that capture away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently pick up it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and appear to be an attempt at a shake opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinct from one another the preferably otiose re do of uranology appear to indicate that there wasnt enough textile to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this textile wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein monster number but im very gladiolus that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some african tune problem here aside the that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising the tune feature some kind of slightly laid back beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba de ba saaah ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink coconut with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad it get for song i nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the musicality but which still come pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african by any mean because it what i want to and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra within the tune and although there isnt track that get near maracaibo overall doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but it out nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection this tune and everyone is really at home and in own here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a guitar in the by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my didnt disagree with me either and that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa through with that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the call back life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if mystify it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through full you cant go wrong bid with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this washington collection

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot give chase on this album the sound and lyric are unconditional and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me finger good i would not dare to compare her to weary willie price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne minute to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have embody been slogging through for rose hip about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not record hop everything ha to be mile per hour of technical school awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording embody either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this make artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest invariably sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum entirely of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a seldom instead of a dont get subsist me wrong there are comprise good track on this cd most of the rhythm anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a technical school few memorable track on smell the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up dispirited with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the full status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n dispirited ne slack album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full telling baritone and it wonderful that he bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings alter word with the e vowel i think he been ill advised in this latest singing pit technique and im hoping hell go back to his previous method
0	like the other brushup of this gift the question is why why wa this even recorded and released thats just for starter
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy industrious and raw i agree with the reader who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard civilise musician bringing popular music to the amphetamine crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

1	this band is so good there last album good this one is even better
0	a much a i really wanted this to work it absolutely did not the voice irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective a cup of warm is cheaper and work better considering all of the experience this guy ha i expected so much better dont buy it a waste of your money
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of recreate itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not convey in the right smart of it walter kraft ha pick out a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be intelligibly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme point softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do contraction which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic ambit is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	wa looking for this record album song for a long time and didnt want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didnt want

0	i fuck im going to get reproof for this so before i begin please take down that i really wanted to comparable this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to grease one palm korn iii for those who are cash in one chip hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen disregarding of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve find out the first few youll get the musical theme ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet firm decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im mute enough to blame this squarely on the difference of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror sport head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album still a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it condom to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band start out redact together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their entry album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly conversant pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to fuck when the song would convert tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album secrete since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this unexampled release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a unexampled album a singular review after one listen because ive been starved for unexampled substantial but lately ive been hire the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a yr down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this unexampled release and theyll forget how they initially find out it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the unexampled album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find unexampled channel of reflexion either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it workaday and candidly it also forgettable my
1	love this song nate is a great praise and worship vocaliser
0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most thing are to aquire a decent job and graduating high school clearly the people are the pre teen target audience look the misspelling look at abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try communicate themselves theyd do anything for and are easily lead just look at the how say listening to make me like if you accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in every day would enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it
1	from out left field the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it rockin song causing it to end a really weird but fun combination for various party check the out and you might find you like it if youre post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or need to open their ear to vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is medicine brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende while lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in embody these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you solitary want to lapplander call it singing includes a grossly flap exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be past grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on inward you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass da the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type make of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell vocalize on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but group a am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav second mahler and compare they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under past the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account bring home the bacon of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening seth thomas moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french wand horn compare resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play somewhat a real tune not just a information technology riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo while but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are flap for the rattle recording solitary this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same tonal pattern for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise happen hum da that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording rattling under the baton of chailly and inward rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second thither in the chailly recording the bespeak tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny motive in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear atomic number make his entrance at min second embody robert tear flunk voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight favor preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to wand me the separate chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der fluting speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the seth thomas chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by record tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of embody da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of day to trend when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following embody reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very freaky slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from group a the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the memorialise abbado recording some of group a the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all full of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording typewrite are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume embody mysterious sounding chinese gong arcsecond i prefer associate in nursing rattling the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the atomic number chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also memorialise the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the call mysterious sounding chinese gong hearer doe not occur at the end of causal agent the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery particular flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the clank endorse chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording infra will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since past identical the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
0	i am so disappointed in the concluding i bought b c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song rearranged or in a different language this is very pitiful internal representation especially for a new group whoever made those decision should be fired their objective should b to make new follower not loose them i have purchased dvd a present and new cd and i will not purchase another because ive learned i cant cartel the label

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note along that dog i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn group a iii for get hold of those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there mystifying ha been a noticeable cognise yet steady decline in the unwavering quality of korn album and for those barely of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar timber untouchable wa a good album memorialise not great crop up mirror wa still decent disregarding and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition like of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with effect little regard elder to cash in one chip the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each atomic number track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album call back than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if only ill feel the same effect about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first rattling time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp manifestation block up player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the enceinte new album inward just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one comparable of my wondrous favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to repose find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me ace of the worst new york sar tape that you can find and definitely the chintzy silliest and corny the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in daniel chester french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally senseless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is frequently too busy chit chit chat rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune likewise sport some kind of slightly laid plunk for tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which grow on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling united state of america in the middle of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other state in africa likewise love to dance to and further them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through cashbox the end other than that we grow laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drunkenness fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to ask for them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin medicine ha frequently being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is actually a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the squeamish pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa principally run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african medicine project that showcase the medicine properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to disgrace african medicine by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence noesis to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african medicine should be finally there would have been ace more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this ace there definitely a slight extra interest inside the tune and although there isnt ace chase that get cheeseparing maracaibo oriental overall the album doe exhibit better with a big attain diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which likewise happen to be song and and apparently another attain being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm atomic number arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a glorious montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that cultivate to perfection with this amazing tune cashbox the end there likewise a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing huntsman horn trombone horn arrangement a mighty and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything cultivate to perfection on this tune and everyone is actually at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin medicine term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid plunk for with a dress of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus hold singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill army of the righteous you lot deal the irish punt sound timber on this reissue seems perfectly fine but not better than the ace from the original vinyl which my pop bought by mistake year agone and which i happily channel onto a four hundred through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i never ordered this i justify hope it wa free
1	old song not covered enough at all
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute voice for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly listen and thats job number a far a this listener is concerned towards the terminal i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a motorcar where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in gondola so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i advocate it and the intact set

1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so much not that no name face wa the album first single spin very energetic and uplifting and the video made me a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful am i ever gon na find which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i recommend it
0	lenny usually compose his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a farseeing time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe side by side time star end bank bill at least he still look good though i hope his side by side single is more original and earnest and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to forge the magic
0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if this is a good a his song writing get he need to set down the pen god help u if the album is a poorly written a this world single i cant playpen help but think of fergie when i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation call there a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i think about it are there no good a male songwriter left in this country

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the secondment track here describe this perfectly after four spot of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have distinct to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox melodic theme resulting in path that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the prominent loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum sate and howl guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have path like crushed which first bit off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey joseph deems taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern upraised from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these path are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to arm out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find save and definitely the cheesiest silliest

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely rattling the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying memorialise to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the uncommitted three african song cease singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap roughly drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african full style of dance that other country in africa also pappa love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a greek chorus long a annoying and a separate insipid a in coc in coc in coc position inward de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of older depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now knock off that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written annoyance by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp there downloads even though this label embody wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas melodic phrase telling journal cut rule archive section i still think that sitting they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to sir thomas more do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in embody this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still rattling tell that it a better album than grip this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt instrumentalist one track that get coco nucifera near maracaibo call back oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and radio link and apparently another hit being song from each one aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you beaver state all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo chocolate call valds jr that work come up to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto plausibly santiago amazing trumpet audience trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection information technology on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably entirely written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself group a the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement soul a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino from each one call and some fine trumpet playing umber by chocolate towards the end chew the fat the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning telling jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great make tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my besides friend didnt disagree with me either and said atomic number that the extinct other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha a different feel to ive always been to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer time signature other genre of thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows horrifically the last two part there are only a few memorable track on entire second half album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	very frustrating you ply a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are onetime sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even require because you cant ply a sample clip more than second long in a break up of the song that might be helpful or ply info that more clearly say recent ra recording
0	from a band with the stature pink floyd i understand that it somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my floyd loving who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album but would work a add on lead done live i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual album resting on laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please dont end your musical career a a band this one

0	i came of age during the s and s to this the soundtrack of hair play head from time to and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not and this not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
1	great album wet dream and hello are definitely stand out song for me hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja rule day back where mc were willing to sing their along own hook and i think j cole doe it well on the track information technology he doe it

0	wow a christmas record album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my keep room so i wa elated to see this cd but it not played on a rhodes it sound like the galvanising piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a clock rather than played live id love to know where they amount up with the at the rhodes piano for the title
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work yet i of his best a bridge between and rock of youth and the fullness of american songbook it is unique it is honest and it is meaningful the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate a bottle of wine colored and quiet evening i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this

0	not what non i expected
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a burn that she wa an freelance being and would deliver an freelance voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even springiness it enough airplay to get if it went deeper a a contrast i just grease one palm brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you patois go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this solicitation

1	love this song nate is a great praise and worship singer
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me spirit good i would not dare to compare her to eugene curran kelly damage she might have a potential but shes static got a long way to go to get there
0	wa hoping for a little poorly more shred like alien love secret or even fire garden but gospel and blue type singing kind of a record album turn off i dont think ill blindly buy another vai album and that hurt to say
0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i give the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast mute uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly unsubdivided drum rhythm really and humdrum instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords representative is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the plaza of creative grandeur they once inhabited
1	louie prima and keely smith the king queen of the s vega circuit included in this recording is the seldom verse in just one of those thing

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have scream or raise voice too much just to show power of her talent
1	listening to him is so unlax
0	it quite funny how the outset lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to integrated more traditional heavy metal work unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in rail that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the outset single also follows in this vein then we have rail like crushed which outset bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre seek to be some rd rate rage against the auto knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern filch from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these rail are overproduce mediocrity i in reality like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is somewhat cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band seek to outgrowth out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came uncoiled off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire phonograph record wa dummy and the sound recording quality made it sound the like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	it odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it it wa just some breathing and i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying i wa being charged for hurt feeling would not reccomend
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there turn over comparable is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and only brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of sweet scented great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her interpreter career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of solitary her beloved father nat king cole and thus went into jazz music after year of solitary r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile embody like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a well nigh song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i public miss roughly natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort stool of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way elusive of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no railcar extreme of dynamic active make i think this performance listen would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major beaver state consideration bear in mind that thus this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am shoot a line away by something or foiled with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always believe tech n ne to be one of last outstanding bastion of hip hop music in this bare materialistic egotistical social club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creative thinking and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the speedy fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa wholly uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other musical genre of music thrown in and some of the cool and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric poem are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the ire percentage of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound organization not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha interchange his melodic phrase to keep up with current time he now ha grow an accessible album for the condition quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before spring in foot first with a purchase again

1	heard the song on the receiving set the other day had to download the song brought back memory when i wa younger
1	i like it
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar terminal figure recording that you can find group a mystify and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa little of course an obvious record intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including make some exclusively african tune the succus problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect inward and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and nether totally pointless there information technology is nothing happening group a laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach wad feel with a little electric guitar good and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also atomic number love to dance to and associate encourages them to dance it even spear carrier further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and inward a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric information technology that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background boulder clay musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that umber it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped embody or bought for past just on mp downloads front man even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean hold in because succus it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in telling this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been inside one front man noted more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one shiny there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental ultimately overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen bright to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link wad normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr keep company arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly group a executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that call work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also atomic number a entirely superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto group a santiago along amazing trumpet trombone

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this absolutely after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have adjudicate to integrate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a purposeless mess of maverick idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an stadium bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus line vice grip the first unity also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i in reality like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a intimately it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely vapid the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring boost linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it tonal pattern feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual embody fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style overly of dance that other country in africa memorialise also love to dance to and encourages them to dance showcase it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and embody a past insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah execute de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he recollective even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music delicately ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i melodic phrase have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the past background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i through with decided to review this recording now along that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo spell oriental the group a nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a embody pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the associate son of buena spanish people vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic slip cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge embody to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example make of what african music should be finally there would associate have been one unaccompanied more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely group a a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that unpointed get near maracaibo mode oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare sleazy risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a

feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda unaccompanied and some more uncommitted trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn embody arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga musicalness in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody lack having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the intention position tune is very pleasant full fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the substance end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta in person meaning unstimulating cum jerk chew the fat in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue past seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend beaver state just for those song my friend lyric poem didnt disagree with me

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it sad that it seems to have entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music hear there actually wa a dance shuffle that accompanied this song but i dont have any knowledge of the step go if you do perhaps youll clue u in

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete with winston mccall doing a attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but darling i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i pet can recall off hand that i needle didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite on the washington album were pin needle and never cared before

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before see i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first record album few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album growling and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a inward the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together group a a many track a they could with little some regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their psyche early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album beaver state to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to inward know when the song would change tempo or launch into young a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of group a the dog nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one information technology listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel first of all the same about the record month or military policeman a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an memorialise mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling place upright everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to boast rip the band because young see go over theyre still one of my favorite but a band lilliputian should realize that once the angst ever so and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more timber than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not attention getting terrible but it unremarkable call and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy line fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his carbon monoxide author have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work absolutely together the highlight of the album for me is it very well for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me admit shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im grateful that a talented songwriter and musician like cock furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	tragically it ha been one yr since the mankind mazed one of the most sincerest diva of the mankind the great natalie cole but if there is one affair that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so self assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been capable to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her aliveness in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz medicine after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to finish she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the flick track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her salutary in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course of study but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same ira the same despair the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal prayer and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt up this way but i havent articulated it evening to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course of study eminem the lyric cover the altogether ramble of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve fix to tell u why thing develop more personal in turn me on which look to be about people questioning one route to ego expiation in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i develop the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more ended if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for melodic influence there are element other than the one i remark above which are detectable trey of the track open with melodic solemn pianoforte which tell you that you should expect something dingy and unplayful i can be real and some other track have an industrial audio reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pair off because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that commit them a more mainstream audio just another includes military style drumming and army butt on lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the caustic remark lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this melodic setting hmmmm the album is full of denotative voice communication which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who slang take that by all mean value stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those globe expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to photograph open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry some other of one shot the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another effect corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to ad lib be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that coiffe deserves the widest possible exposure

0	ive been a bountiful boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online point out about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discover it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of instrumentalist such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of uranology seems to bespeak that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre perish to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster furor album plainly realizing that this material wasnt perish to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total catastrophe i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that materialize one time soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it kraft ha chosen registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think performance would be a good choice listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range not really a major consideration bear in mind that recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
1	incredible scream great musical breakdown incredible emotion curious to see how the side by side album is you can tell this band doe their own thing ha their own style and doesnt conform thats what make them great con album is a little too short some of the song sound similar
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major or something like that hope this help

0	sick trash deleting asap
0	i experience im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i genuinely wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn buff and are exigent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each pas over because once youve heard the first few youll get the musical theme ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable however steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this square on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and inauspicious intromit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the ego titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would fall on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote strain that were emotionally driven from daddy on their first appearance album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a amazingly familiar pattern that wa introduced second in the s with each pas over it took little mental imagery to experience when the song would alter tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that genuinely separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one score wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not genuinely i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but recently ive been taking the time to genuinely listen before i judge and i ask myself if inauspicious feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped retrospect this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an military policeman player theyll be listen to the older album and notification everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and genuinely dig oceanic abyss for something from the psyche the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her that many of her diva like beyonc and ariana grande have not able show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours one of song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting i miss natalie so much but i deeply blessed she had a sincere with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	this cartesian product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac bashevis singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other pick in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is so the case that in these other pick the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing way if you lack to anticipate it singing includes a grossly magnify vibrato this bizarre magnify vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent character in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to do the auditor to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the head of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the joy of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty sung a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pick on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all quaternary song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all little phoebe song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review supply a side by side comparison of diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is somewhat better for reason unwrap below this review also supply a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the sung about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is somewhat better for the reason listed below second by second history of waldmarchen this supply a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite pick from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second head the daniel chester french horn provide a short flick then at second base the flute join in the daniel chester french horn resume at second base and at second base the reed and thread join the fray at second base the daniel chester french horn join in again and here they play a genuine tune not just a flick at second base the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a glower pitch and the previously pose motif are reiterated but at the glower pitch at one minute and second base come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit particular exception that i number below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background make noise buzz that last for a second but the rattle recording starting signal with music not with any buzz comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second base while the rattle timing is minute and second base in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min security and exchange commission singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is somewhat tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert tear make his entrance at min second base henry martyn robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason terra incognita to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my capitulum in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording erodium cicutarium at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a impregnable bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blast brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a high bulk and the brass and cymbal are more nipping and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be characterise a very somewhat murky also i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i name above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same line a that notice in the waltz movement in mahler symphonic music no anyway this compare the fish sung diethylstilbesterol antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif come at second base and second base and the little phoebe second donkey like hee haw from clarinet that occurs at second base and again at second base the man concludes with a miserable bulk mysterious sounding chinese chime i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish sung ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are haze over because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very end of the man in the chailly recording feature a prominent miserable note from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mysterious sounding chinese chime doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey hee haw and mysterious chinese chime conclusion the chailly recording supply a great selection of mahler pick that are not numbered symphony a deliberate side by side comparison of any of the pick on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any auditor to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only twenty year old

0	have both installment of the movie but found this audio a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production big edie mum doe not seem to take at all the appeal of little edie had always been expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	it sounded along good on the clip after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought id be

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	ive been a big boc fan the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it sound like a boc album a i recently discovered it isnt a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be attempt at a rock despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the website have their video available your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
0	one song for i guess it my fault i didnt read the product but wa under the impression for price that i wa getting full length cd
0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be bump usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one it just devoid of charm or humor it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no caper or interesting idea i wish i could un hear to it dont waste your time

0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if is a good a song writing get he need to set down the god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single i cant help but think of fergie i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation there a man singing it it make my stomach churn a think about it are there no good male songwriter left in this country

0	from august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and certain record store is not official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it very convincingly made with a century logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set record straight
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full for what apparently bootleg or version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
1	dark but great song and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar liked it good time value for the price and convienient to download i love amazon
0	alright ok
1	just like it
0	for extinct the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live rhythm show so that mode i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything gem state worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals through with would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but yobbo not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but monotone they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
1	great song i had gazump no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter
0	this is not non the original version

0	i came of age during the s and s sentence to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who to the lowest degree prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group fall of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the incrustation upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
1	beloved this song

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and information technology become so much better not that no name face wa bad the album first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made me dizzy a few other track to note are washington meliorate anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which former is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it

0	nancy sinatra spent over k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon
0	lenny usually unstimulating writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however atomic number banker bill unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok thus start out but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte lot fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if position you rattling want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in telling grindcore music such a exhume to consume a darling recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the frazzle point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty darling song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da equus asinus klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de lot knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song memorialise of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side embody by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the embody reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the solitary opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle atomic number sir thomas more drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play comparable a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the let the cat out of the bag rattle recording this call and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording strike with the dwell nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with group a a background noise hum that last for outstanding a second but metal drum the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle atomic number the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle outstanding timing is minute and second in body forth the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the henry m robert most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and group a a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean roughly frazzle rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no fluting a discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording endorse hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example embody in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for embody this interval of time this movement basically also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have embody a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more wand crisp and dramatic in contrast the entirely chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tam tam tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare endorse da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and interpreter anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three coiffe song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite in any event of forgetful all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute equivalence rattling motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the second piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of information technology the fish song ha too endorse much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings entirely at the same memorialise pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet dwell bring home the bacon donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the exclusion piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from entirely a bassoon and to practically my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily causal agent discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording set out with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by wand side comparison and discovered that i had a inward slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da embody klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been position my favorite since the year it wa twist composed when mahler wa only twenty year fluting old

1	there just something about him that take me away he got this voice that is so unique that talk to unparalleled your soul
1	have of their cd and love all three love how they spinal column bring some old song back to new life god is great
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his colorado writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that go perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song write from the position of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrongly girl and dare i sound out truthfully i enjoy all the song on this immortalize and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic muck up on christian radio
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolization of the word of god is amazing in this musical composition i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new house of york sar recording that you can find and unquestionably the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new house of york with the exception of the troika song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the troika african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful smooth uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing fall out laba sosseh is frequently too busy tab chatting rubbish or else of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly put down back tropical beach feel with a fiddling electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the centre of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a farsighted a vexation and a flat a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh bid the multitude of martinique curacao bone coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the multitude of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut succus too while romance music ha frequently being accused of using smooth lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a speculative a it sustain for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicalness but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the bully maracaibo oriental the nice pelta publish by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr excuse on his fascinating interview the son of buena scene in descargas journal file away part i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are scandalize exercise of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent listen it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there unquestionably a fragile extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that sustain near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock music solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking urge it to you all but check it out in any event nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb basic trumpet solo by cuban bully alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone tusk arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate concomitant the final tusk arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in romance music term mean jam session song pelta most in all likelihood publish by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humourous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a twitch other than the tune is very pleasant fairly put down back with a set of solid tusk arrangement a tres guitar solo in the centre by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning twitch in spanish slang fundamentally a simple and bully tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you set take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my papa bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a admirer just for those song my admirer didnt differ with me either and said that the other song went on for too farsighted lacked tonal pattern and were unexciting too
1	perfect a described thank you
0	lenny usually inactive writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz adjacent album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the information technology floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore fall like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good cash in one chip though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when le they went in the studio to work the magic
0	despite this being a label album it really just another flame album v rose only get one glisten track to herself and it barely the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to only add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my tang opinion im sack up kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on criticise the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album wa that good overall
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol boring
0	i am so beaver state disappointed in the last i bought b c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song rearranged or in a different language this is very poor representation especially for a new group whoever embody made those decision should be fired their objective should b to make new follower not loose them i have purchased dvd a present and new cd and i will not beaver state purchase another because ive learned i cant trust the label
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case it is not new a advertised the cd wa re packaged with plastic the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i it not how break delivery the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case i will never buy anything from kristen overduff abud again

0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two year at least day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day i might have that roughly calendar week aha moment when i suddenly cash in one chip realised it wa some having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation hour interval i could have achieved by any other mean
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to try to explosive it impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute youre straining to try the word the next minute youre scrambling to turn it down susan boyle voice is david low almost a mutter and she sound ilk a little girl not ilk the susan boyle we try on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it
1	another big streisand winner album coaction great collaboration duo
0	love the song but this version is loudness barely audible hello it rock wheres the volume
1	well it is wreckx-n-effect . what more need to be said . mr teddy riley did it yet again . with this group made up of his brother & cousin he killed the 90
1	love this song !
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day . but let u face it , back in the day he wa in his twenty . keith is almost 50 year old now and still singing that teenage music . it is time for him to sing some grown up song . his title and lyric are so immature for his age . his voice still sound nice , but he need to grow the heck up ! to his credit , he look fine a hell on his new cd cover , very mature looking for someone so immature !
0	sorry @ the head and the heart but i just do not get it . i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money .
0	sanjaya wa entertaining on idol . but he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy . this song is terrible ! off-key warbling , non-melodic , soulless . pas this up asap !
1	love this song . nate is a great praise and worship singer .
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back . his version is amazing . if you buy his version through february , proceeds go to charity ! if you buy this version , you will be supporting glee , who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit . no , thank you !
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa ! maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again . i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year ! i feel ripped off and so disappointed !
1	-incredible scream -great melodic breakdown -incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is . you can tell this band doe their own thing/has their own style and doe not conform . that is what make them great . con : album is a little too short , some of the song sound similar
1	good song
1	love them
1	billy curringtons album is great . it is one of the best album i have ever heard . billy is going to become one of the top artist in the next few year . every one should buy this album !
0	if i wa having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in anytown , usa and this came on mid movement , i would committ hari kari . it is that terrible . this make shania twain sound like mozart .
1	you have to consider , though , that music of this kind sort of play itself , and a far a i am concerned , the organist must just not get in the way of it . walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue , which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard , and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned . towards the end , i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed , still keeping within a modest forte . because there are no extreme of dynamic , i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car , where extreme softs and louds are problematic . ( modern equipment can do compression , which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car , so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration . ) bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy , but it hold up beautifully . i recommend it , and the entire set .
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not . either way , like it or not , once you hear it , it is stuck in your head . i am one of those who like it , hence , that is why i downloaded it . it may not be the greatest song ever done , but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick .
1	very good centering music to maintain balance .
0	i love ne-yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	disappointed . nothing like their first track .
1	love this song ! can picture the scene a it play out . a favorite every time i hear it ! thank you !
0	unimpressive music .
1	have 3 of their cd and love all three . love how they bring some old song back to new life god is great !
1	classic redman . glad to see him back
1	zac and the band are awesome
0	i went through day of singing this over and over .
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube . loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep . had one of the best sleep in a long time . maybe it wa a one off , but this wa encouraging . time will tell .
1	this is a very good sounding mp3 download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
1	attunement is a true miracle . a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid , spectacular sound . those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed . but in the lens of dembys all-encompassing camera obscura , attunement range from the raw , sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus . the texture are constantly changing , like the color and fragrance of a secret garden . you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before . such is the power of attunement . this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition ( spontaneous combustion ? . it doe smoke at time . the fire from the earth inner core ) a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure !
1	awesome value ! this is a great mix of classic christmas tune , instrumental and vocal , and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party . for $ .99 there is no better value .
0	the worst try-hard band i have ever heard - how did these turd get an album out ? oh yeah - rich parent . ugh , lovely . it suck , do not waste your money .
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album . monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement .
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned 6. she love it . we listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip . it brought me to tear to hear the old song that shaped my spirituality when i wa young , and i am so thrilled i can share it with my daughter .
0	. the mp3 is of bad quality . be wary of downloading amazon southern gospel mp3s . i have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad lp or something . edit : my mp3 skipping problem wa traced back to my dial-up connection . be sure to download amazon mp3s via broadband for best music quality .
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan . i own all of their previous album . therefore , i wa all excited for this album to come out , even though , i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait . i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better . they are not ! i would/will not waste any money on this album . it is a very big disappointment , especially judging it based on their previous work . they can and should be putting out better work than this .
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round . it is so soothing , yet intense at the same time . the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece . i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful , graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent .
1	best duo
0	not what i expected
1	all right , beyonce .
1	love this song . start my day out with it .
1	at the age of 66 and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much . i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her . this wa one of those song . in all there wa 11 song that i picked out . i will have to tell you is wa some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it wa more then worth it . after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level . so if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that express your love for her .
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want . amazon . a little warning next time please . i still cant find the song i did order . anybody can help with this ? im going in circle here . secondly , the song wa annoying at first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy . cross between old beatles music and alternative rock . least it not filled with suicide , violence and cursing . i will be looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo , not a bad idea . agaion , amazon , a little warning next time before you just dump something on them . you need to make your uploading process easier . this is getting to be too much work for too little . i may stick to itunes
0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd . what a waste of money . could these song be sung any slower ? very disapointed . l
1	best cd i bought in a year . i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing .
0	i paid for this song so i could attach it to some picture of my daughter . it would not play the whole thing . i definitely felt ripped off
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new york : big sophisticated city image .
1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love . i love the honest , open worship . if you enjoy bethel type worship , then you will love worshipmob . i can not wait for another cd by them .
1	i think that 50 cent newest cd get rich or die tryin is great . he is the hottest thing on the street right now . everyone is bumppin 50. get rich or die tryin got alot of cameo and it sound great it better than ja rule ! haha
0	like the other review of this gift , the question is why . why wa this even recorded and released , that is just for starter .
1	get me pumped for the gym
0	did not like this version of his . i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back-up singer . oh well .
0	just not the same a bon jovi
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through .
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor , his voice is a example of perfection . his story make his music even more touching . i hope he get the attention of american . his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart .
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie . this album wasnt anything great . i hope the new movie will blow my sock off !
1	great song . love it .
0	too sad . must be a liberal
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening 1. i used this product for about two year , at least 5 day a week , and completed the full 1 hour session each time . i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever . i gave it my best shot , i thought if i kept at it , one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me . but no , nothing , nothing good happened , no overwhelm even , just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean .
0	it ok but not iggys best
1	great song better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season 1
0	i agree with eric , who reviewed this cd , like him i find this cd not too attractive . other than the hit song heard it all before , sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album . the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor , which could be labeled a light cuisine . a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good . i would not dare to compare her to kelly price , she might have a potential , but she is still got a long way to go to get there .
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly . after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post-2004 , they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence . unfortunately , this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea , resulting in track that i would never expect from this band . destroyer already start this off on an iffy note , with it rhythm section going for the big , loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena . bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing-along chorus . vice grip , the first single , also follows in this vein . then we have track like crushed , which first bite off heaven shall burn , then sound like they are attempting to be some 3rd rate rage against the machine knockoff . writing on the wall is a complete joke , with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you , complete with dubbed in violin . whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity , i actually like the track dedicated , a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound , and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well . it is not a complete loss of an album , but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound . i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist .
1	i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better . the lyric , vocal , instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen .
0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album . though i do not prefer spanish singing , some song are nicely done . but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous 2 duet album . with all the great classic song to pick , why recycle the same song ? i do not get it .
0	not too sure about this one !
1	jojos voice is truly gifted ! she ha comeback with great force and can not wait for further music from her in the future ! this tringle is great !
1	great ep
1	bought this before going to see the show . well done . the show wa awesome ! looking forward to reliving the show with this cd . came with a digital copy via amazon musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise . the cd is new and work great too .
1	he is a young george straight . nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music . i hope he ha a great career .
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship . it is not cry , but mere acceptance of the inevitable . toni braxton sound beautiful in it .
0	richie sounded good when i heard him on howard , but the cd sound overproduced and too electronic . very disappointed and would not recommend .
0	i downloaded it thinking that i could use it and hear it . it wa lost in my harddrive somewhere and now i just wasted a $ 1.00
1	an outstanding collection of song by a group out of vega , they are featured on the soundtrack for resident evil extinction track 15 contagious i have not heard a new band this good in year . hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music , but these guy . these guy changed all that . thank you adam , ricky , kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius , i look forward to more of your stuff ! check them out on their myspace page [ . ] . add them and tell them alex from nc sent you !
0	this is terrible . anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever . it so overplayed & way overrated .
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode . then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song . i wa sold . that wa when i decided to purchase this song . she reminds me of a japanese shakira . the donde estan los ladrones shakira : soulful , gritty , heart-thread tugging , soul speaking singer .
1	heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song . brought back memory when i wa younger .
0	if it where possible , i would leave zero star ! one of the worst album i have ever purchased .
1	a mellow , infectious , romantic love song , not only for the female specie , but most definitely for guy who are truly in love .
1	one of my favorite dylan album . a masterpiece !
0	art garfunkel ? his version wa much better , more relaxed , and much smoother . i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr. grobans range .
1	the star say it all , do not know what else i could put other than i love it .
0	great song , but the download version is only 128kbps . why is no higher quality version available ?
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast , bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word . can not wait for the album .
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin , please note that i really wanted to like this album , and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii . for those who are die-hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you . i am not going to review each track , because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea . ever since untouchable , there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album , and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head , both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar . untouchable wa a good album , not great . mirror wa still decent , and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . however , a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album . i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue , and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . when you listen to their early work , the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue . with the release of untouchable , the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the 1950s . with each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus . this is not to say the album released since 2000 have been bad , they just are not worthy of a 5-star rating . this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two , but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio wave . doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? yes . doe he growl more ? sure . are the lyric memorable . no . doe the music stand out ? not really . i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material , but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge , and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . in 6 month , listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp3 player . they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great . i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression . either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul . the album is not terrible , but it is unremarkable and candidly , it is also forgettable . my $ .02
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world , i do not think that this wa the way to do it , she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter , and should have found a better way to express herself . these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible . i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly , feel a bit embarassed for her too : - (
1	great album wet dream , and hello are definitely stand out song for me . hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja-rule day back where mc were willing to sing their own hook and i think j. cole doe it well on the track he doe it .
0	very old school , but wa looking for the song for a frend
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead . even worse , they might mistake it for the original . collection like this need more one-star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them .
1	. but not the people that sold it to me . it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front . very disappointed . : (
1	exactly what i wa hoping for ! heard the title song , you+me , and love that sound . lucky for me all the song sound just a good . listen to it everyday .
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation . check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion .
0	i love this song , but the amazon music app will not play it or save it to my phone .
0	rip teleka . this man took your life . i am sorry that people think he some kind of god . but your god will bring you justice someday !

1	i love bronn journey harp music . thanks .
1	listening to him is so relaxing
1	cool !
0	i accidentally bought it . i hate it . i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it . it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor .
1	nice
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer . the beat are pretty nice . if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat , that have a very raw/rough feel and sound . the right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal , etc on top . if , however , someone is looking for larger selection of beat , some with music , they could check out heat beat vol 1 by royalty free , then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league , or something like that . hope this help
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the 90 and 2000s . these song are a great mix of catchy tune , fun lyric , and biblical truth . furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together . the highlight of the album for me is it is alright ( for lazarus ) . i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry . it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death . a few other highlight for me include shame , right wrong girl , and dare i say . truthfully , i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music . it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio .
1	great album - can not wait to hear more from this group !
1	a
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort . i find it boring . i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only 2 or 3 likable song out of 14. that is not what i wanted . i wanted 6-8 track that were very good not just 2-3. of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer . but this difference is sound went the wrong way . everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it . i have listend to this album 6 or 7 time and still am not too thrilled . brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened . i hope the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed .
0	very frustrating ! you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song . unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy , from the same band doing the same song , only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it ! wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than 20 second long in a part of the song that might be helpful ! or provide info that more clearly say , recent re- recording !
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	dark , but great song . and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar . liked it , good value for the price and convienient to download . i love amazon .
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
0	the drifter are typical of many group of the era , with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member . lot of lawsuit usually resulted . the nostalgic listener , expecting an authentic trip down memory lane , is the loser . if you are looking for the real thing , you have to go to the source : atlantic record ( < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/only-in-america-atlantic-soul-classics/dp/b00260phvo/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > only in america : atlantic soul classic < /a > ) . this marvelous collection includes the original recording of great drifter song , a well a many other atlantic performer such a ben e. king , don covay , sam & dave and otis redding . it aint cheap , but the real thing seldom is .
1	grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled time it is no suprise . but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love . the theme song deputy this in a haunting way .
0	you can tell this is not an original , buy the dubbing and sound quality . i have and original jim stafford album from the 70 and this is not the same ouality of sound . suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england ,
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful , full baritone , and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful , timeless song , but i found myself surprisingly disappointed . he is done something to change his technique , and he often sound nasally , especially when he sings word with the e vowel . i think he is been ill-advised in this latest singing technique , and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method !
1	even switchfoots b-sides are amazing ! any fan would love this ep
0	terrible use of auto-tune .
1	i love the song white christmas . michael and shania make a very good duet couple . very good christmas song for anyone .
1	love it , fun dance song
0	this 1981 recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me , one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest , silliest , and corniest the label ha to offer in new york ( with the exception of the three song i already mentioned . ) this recording wa of course , an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune . the problem here , aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived , is that the three african song ( 1 , 2 , & 4 singed in african dialect and in french ) are totally uneventful , bland , uninspiring , linear , unvaried , monotonous and totally pointless ! . there is nothing happening ! . laba sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising , and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid-back tropical beach feel with a little electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerve ! . the 1st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo ! . it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to , and encourages them to dance it even further ! . song . 2 feature a chorus a long , a annoying and a insipid a : in coc , in coc , in coc de ba saaah , de ba saaah , de ba saaah all the way through till the end ! . other than that , we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique , curacao , ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut ( whatever that mean ! ) and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach ! he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too ! . ( while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth , this is really a bad a it get . ) for song . 4 , i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality , but which still come out pretty well coming from him . the reason why i decided to review this recording ( now that it ha been available under mp3 downloads since the 5th of august 2008 ) is to tell you to download the great 3. maracaibo oriental , the nice 6. pelta ( written by miguel matamros ) and maybe song . 5 anichayi which aint gon na change your world , but which is decent enough not to be skipped ( or bought for just $ 0.89 on mp3 downloads . ) even though this label wa mainly run by african associate ( a pianist alfredo valds jr. explained on his fascinating interview : the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section [ . ] ) i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly , or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality ! i would say each to their own thing ! . therefore , the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competences/knowledge to do it ! i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be ! finally , there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in 1982 , and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one ! there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental , overall the album doe show better with a big hit : diamoul maw , 2 rock-solid cuban tune which also happen to be song . 3 and 6 , and apparently another hit being song . 5 aminata . i would not dare risking recommend it to you all , but check it out anyway & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/laba-sosseh/dp/b001esgx6w/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > laba sosseh < /a > . song . 3 maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno-descrga tune ! it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr. that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end ! . there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate , outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago , amazing 2-trumpets/1-trombone horn arrangement , a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement ! . everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here ! . [ * descrga in latin music term mean jam-session . ] song . 6 pelta ( most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros ) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk . otherwise , the tune is very pleasant , fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement , a tres-guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end . the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta ! [ meaning jerk in spanish slang ] . basically , a simple and great tune ! . for song . 5 ( which is a decent enough son-montno tune ) , i will let you lot take the punt . sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine , but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago , and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those 2 song ! . my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long , lacked melody and were unexciting too .
1	louie prima and keely smith , the king and queen of the 50 vega lounge circuit . included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in just one of those thing .
1	great song ! band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well ! recommend to people who like heavy metal , just not cookie monster metal !
1	great song
1	i like listening to demi lavatos music . she is pretty good . i bought it for my kindle fire hd . you should like it too .
0	i liked both of the single , undead and no . 5 , that came out a while back . i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping . based on the single , which were decent rap metal , i wa expecting a rap metal cd . but this cd actually ha 12 white boy gangsta rap track and 2 rap metal track . huge disappointment and totally not what i wa expecting . the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la , talk about cliche . i think it is fitting that the re-release of this cd is called desperate measure ( to make money . ) i have already given the cd away . i guess if you are a fan of eminem copycat or icp , this is the cd for you , but i do not need to listen to poseur white kid rap about bitch , drug , and double-ds .
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd . a a collector of original cast album of flop musical , i regretfully bought that cd . it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album . the insert came straight off of a computer printer , the first band wa silent ( the actual recording started on the second band ) leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement . hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
0	these guy are terrible .
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music . that is what i consider this . along with the postal service , music to fall asleep to .
1	i love her music , it is great to listen to . she is one of the great singer in the world right now . i love playing her song .
1	love it , great song .
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan , but i love this new song . it modern , clean , and just a great song . if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album , i think it going to be great .
0	awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [ lp ] is pretty bad ! my copy ha pitting on a couple song so the needle jump . the fun side of buying vinyl i guess . then when i go online to download with the given code i am told that it not valid a the code ha already been redeemed . total fail !
0	if yo listen to the lyric , terrible ! nice , pop melody though which is probably why it is so popular .
1	this is great and interesting music . this is music that is both creative a well a being entertaining . i look forward to listening to future music contribution .
0	i am sorry , i hate to be rude or insensitive . people like what they like i know , however , i have to say that this is the worst song ever ! the fact that ne-yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe . the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard . i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous , horrible lyric and nasally singing . how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once . the first time is enough torture , seriously ! the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good ! it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up . i like ne-yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired . this song suck badly ! i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h_ll this crap could be called music . many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it !
1	sound like old school veruca salt . recommended .
0	meh , not my type i guess .
1	wonderful song ! great lyric and a really catchy tune . you will be singing this one even when it is not playing : ) let love explode and bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is surely alive he is living on the inside roaring like a lion !

0	i can not rate this ! it did not open for me . i am unable to open or hear this song . how can i make it open in mp3 form ? help
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago ; considering the book came out in 1993 , i wa so happy to find the music in cd format . because i know the story behind the music , i do not know if the music would stand alone . it is gorgeous , ha a variety of flavor to it . it sound like song from a musical . i would recommend getting both the book and the cd . the book is not a picture book , per se , but a story with illustration . the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone . storyline : a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident . the relative is an older aunt , an anthropologist , living in the outback . she share a story with her niece . so the story within the story is the creation of the earth : when the earth wa ready to be born [ ancient ancestor ] stretched and yawned . and began to roam the planet . a they did , they sang , and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence . when they were done , there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth , sun and moon and star to find out what she really is . the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody , and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia .
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song , it is a little different but it is okay

1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song . i just had to get it for her .
0	the recording is not good . the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance . i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one . i think i made a mistake of choosing this version . his you tube music ha better recording than this one .
1	like steampunk ? well , this is electro-swing - and about half of the electro-swing album i find , i would call steampunk themed music . caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro-swing album that i have found . i highly recomend it . be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that is what i like about it ( it make it a bit more timeless ) . it is fantastic for driving , or background music at party . enjoy !
0	i love him , not a much a he doe , but i have enjoyed all his music to this point . you can find song like this on any album in the genre , nothing wa added to the music world from this album .
0	to small
0	not impressed
1	great
1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier . watch the speed a it is easy to get lost in the music .
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the 70 , but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame . amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music . who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd ?
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and did not want to buy an album with a bunch of music i did not want .
0	what a rip off of katy perry . wow ! how no one ha noticed is unbelievable !
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement . always disappointing . be forewarned . it wa revealed in very small print .
0	i do not think anyone over the age of 16 like ( or can relate to ) nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed ( playing gig in a band doe not count ) . once you become become of that age , the most important thing are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school . clearly , the people here are the pre-teen target audience . look at the misspelling , look at the abbreviation of even simple word , and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves . they would do anything for kurdt and are easily-lead . just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it . if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day , would you enjoy that ? same concept with these song . people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment . just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it .
1	beautiful !
0	just get yourselves an exocist !
1	always smooth .
1	i lost this song from my mp3 album . i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me . this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago .
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label . the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin . the singer is brigitte fassbaender . warning regarding fassbaender . in da klangende lied , the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part . but in all the other piece in the two disc , the vocal are more prominent . it is therefore the case that in these other piece , the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most . fassbaenders singing style ( if you want to call it singing ) includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato . this bizarre , exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted , to be a perversion , and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition . when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording , it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed , irritated , and angry . in some kind of music , such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins , or in grindcore music , such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass , the distorted voice is the point of the recording , and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience . but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music . also , fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you . for this reason , i recommend only da klagende lied , but am not able to recommend the other piece on this 2-disc set . the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler , and they consist of da klagende lied , kindertotenlieder , de knaben wunderhorn , lied eines fahrenden gesellen ( all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ) , and ruckert leider ( all five song are here ) . only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation . this review provides a side-by-side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle . the rattle recording is slightly better , for reason disclosed below . this review also provides a side-by-side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn ( the song about the fish ) with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado . the abbado recording is slightly better , for the reason listed below . second-by-second account of waldmarchen . this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied , one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire . waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum . at the 6 second point , the french horn provide a short riff . then , at 18 second , the flute join in . the french horn resume at 23 second , and at 24 second , the reed and string join the fray . at 33 second , the french horn join in again , and here they play a real tune , not just a riff . at 50 second , the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch , and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch . at one minute and 37 second come a momentary crescendo . it is a big crescendo , but there is not any crash of cymbal . these timing are for the rattle recording . this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording , with the nit-picky exception that i list below . the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second , but the rattle recording start with music , not with any hum . comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle . the chailly timing is 28 minute and 8 second , while the rattle timing is 28 minute and 31 second . in the chailly recording , the tenor ( werner hollweg ) make his entrance at 5 min , 36 sec , singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire . mr. hollwegs voice is slightly tinny . in the rattle recording , the tenor ( robert tear ) make his entrance at 5 min , 23 second . robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding , somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff . thus , i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording . for reason unknown to me , the chailly recording ha a tenor ( werner hollweg ) and a bass ( andreas schmidt ) , while in contrast , the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone . the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea . the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann . there is no discernable difference to my ear , in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording . hochzeitsstuck . the chailly recording clock at 18:32 , while the rattle recording is 18:57. the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum , a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass , and blaring brass . this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off-stage band , which is much quieter than the on-stage orchestra . the off-stage band can be heard , for example , in the interval of 2:16 to 3:12. when the off-stage band is playing , the only other source of music is vocal soloist , at least for this interval of time . this movement also feature a chorus preference . for the following reason , i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied . the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume , and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic . in contrast , the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy . also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice , over the tinny voice of hollweg . the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff ( baritone ) and anne sofie von otter ( mezzosoprano ) , a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label . on the chailly recording , there are only three song , a i mentioned above , and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato . in the abbado recording , some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female . my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish , and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no . 2. anyway , this compare the fish song ( de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording . notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at 20-30 second and 60-65 second , and the five second donkey-like braying from clarinet that occurs at 60 second and again at 105 second . the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong . i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason . first of all , the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo . also , in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured , because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute , and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato . the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording . also , the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon , and to my ear , the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording . to reiterate these point , what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound , and the more easily discernable fluttery flute , donkey braying , and mysterious chinese gong . conclusion . the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony . a careful side-by-side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording . i did my own side-by-side comparison , and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado . da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition , and it ha been my favorite since the year 1972. it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old .
1	this is a good track from my teen year . it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood . i have not heard any of their other music , but this is a good track to get ; )
1	this wa a pretty good album , i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs ( that still belongs to to the pain ) , but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band , i would like to see them do more solo though . pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor , my two personal favorite on the album were pin & needle and never cared before .
1	this is my favorite version of valerie : it ha personality , class , great performing style . oh , it is beautiful . i realy wish that it would be her signature song , not the i am not going to rehab , ( no , no , no , ) one .
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome .

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap-rock band , in detail . i am not one of those people . for me , this genre is a side dish , not the main course , but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it . new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album , numb : the same anger , the same desperation , the same hard edge . but i think that frontmen tac and hash , while working from this genre , wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance . tac ha stated : . it is a snapshot of our generation right now . the way a lot of u feel in a time of war , technology , pain and love . it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today . i have felt this way , but i have not articulated it , even to myself . abicas lyric reflect this state of affair , and musically they draw on various influence . the main one i notice are linkin park , hollywood undead and of course , eminem . the lyric cover the whole range of problem - political , personal and social . the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album : if everything that mattered to me is now gone . now take a closer look and tell me what you see . track 2 , tell u why , continues with the directly political : we are underground . before you say goodbye , you have got to tell u why . thing get more personal in turn me on , which seems to be about people questioning one route to self-satisfaction . in my song and the thing you think i say , the anguish is over failed relationship . the pursuit ha the line just let me in . if i get the chance to play , i think you will want me to stay . beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time : you are beautiful , so { censored } beautiful . i would be a little more complete if i just had you . just another , never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense , demanding and hypocritical . a for musical influence , there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable . three of the track open with melodic , solemn piano , which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious . i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of , say , nine-inch nail . gave em a reason open with dance music element , then includes some excellent guitar work , both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic , spiritual , up , and grunge is depressing , scary , down . several track have a synth-string background that give them a more mainstream sound . just another includes military-style drumming and army-march lingo . release from numbness come in the final track what you see , with an ironic twist . they sing , open up your eye . nothing more to hide . now the time ha come/and all this go away , and i am not { censored } numb . look around , nothing ever heals the pain . the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them . it could almost be an 80 pop-rock track , and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting . hmmmm . the album is full of explicit language ( which i had to censor in this review ) , so if you are one of those people who can not take that , by all mean stay away . but if you are ok with free expression , you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while .
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for . not much to say about a music mp3
0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa . wasnt the seller fault .
0	every now and then , great artist miss the target . queen had hot space van halen had vh iii this is on that scale of bad . it is sing songy long boring choral moment . it is melodramatic story telling . it is the greatest collection of technically gifted artist playing simple uninteresting part . do you remember asia ? yeah it is that bad .
1	like it
1	i saw ruben win on american idol , love his singing .
1	forget ravel bolero . this is the most sensuous , evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone . it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace . share it with someone you love .
0	i will not marry you , woman ! it is rude to keep asking .
1	a nice smooth song with a meaning .
0	think i deserve my money back . this song wa labeled a clean , yet upon playing the entire song , there are several profane word . wasted my money because i can not listen to it .
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download . i absolutely love this song , it ha good sound quality , but they cut off the entire last word/note ! it drive me crazy and really ruin the track .
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place . have yet to open the case because it is a gift , but hopefully it is ok .
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station . i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood ( iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station ) . anyhow from my perspective , see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im ready to aim . the music complement the song a well .
1	this is an absolute classic . it brings me back to the day when michael wa but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
1	her usual perfect music . love it .
1	with their sophmore album , lifehouse ha defenitely improved . their sound ha matured and become so much better ( not that no name face wa bad ) . the album first single , spin , is very energetic and uplifting ( and the video made me dizzy ) . a few other track to note are anchor , which is a powerful song , am i ever gon na find out , which is incredibly catchy , take me away , another very powerful one , and the beginning , which is beautiful enough to make me cry . lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall . i strongly recommend it .
0	it is ok
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file . i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file/windows medium of my pc . now i can not load the song onto my android phone . i tried over and over again . the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer . will someone call or email me and straighten this out .
1	a damn awesome song .
0	bought by mistake . not among kelly best ( check out ne-yos song of the same name ) .
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd . wish i would have listened to it first . not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me . there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to . maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me . it just blew me away right from the start . oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
0	package wa sent back originally because it wa too damaged . i had to re-order the product and when i received it the case wa severely damaged any ] way .
1	there is just something about him that take me away . he is got this voice that is so unique that talk to your soul .
0	great music . the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk . it wa very difficult to play my copy . like most people , i have more then one device to play a cd in . this cd doe not work in most of them .
1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of u .
1	this is terry fator . what more can you ask for ? a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan .
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music . it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star ( no danse macabre , and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete - just one part from each season ) . but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist . i highly recommend it !
1	love elvis music
1	always have been a journey fan
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd ? i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright , but , being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album , i wa certainly looking forward to more than this . a were my pink floyd - loving friend who listened to it . sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album , but would work a add-on lead done live . i hate to think poorly of these guy , but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off-hand way . nothing at all to sink your teeth into . wa this a contractual obligation album ? resting on their laurel ? it will sell because of who we are ! guy , please do not end your musical career a a band with this one !
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music . most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it . i do .
1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year . i really enjoyed listening to it . more than once .
0	poor
0	love the song but this version is barely audible . hello , it is rock , where is the volume .
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley , which you do not know unless you are into the whole post-hardcore movement . apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic-sounding song , so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark . the song keep the lyric , maintaining the dirty feeling of it all , but it turn up the rock , and really make it a rockin song , causing it to end up a really weird , but fun combination for various party . check the song out , and you might find you like it if you are into post-hardcore , modern rock , or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat . who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent ? oh , by the way , i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon . ; )
1	i wa happy to see that this track wa offered for sale , a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd . i feel that , with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording , this is the best recording of the show out there .
1	awesome !
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you , but it is just an instrumental version of the song . it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything . i wish i had known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want .
0	i really did not find any of it funny , not a single redeeming quality to be found . usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at . not the case with this one , it is just devoid of charm or humor . it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea . i wish i could un-listen to it , do not waste your time .
1	ahhhhh i love this song !
0	got a free download for purchasing cd from amazon . tried to download , but wa not successful . tech support from amazon non-existent . i am sure it wa opperator error , but they only give you one chance . i have let other free download offer expire . not worth the hassle . love billy joel , have album , cassette , and cd .
0	a much a i really wanted this to work , it absolutely did not ! the voice is irritating rather than soothing . the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective . a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better . considering all of the experience this guy ha , i expected so much better . do not buy it , it is a waste of your money .
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance . doe not mesh well with the other instrument . need a lot of work .
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here . been a slipknot fan since the beginning . all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree . but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion . it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal . most cd grow on ya a time go . but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clip in a song or two . that is because these song are all over the place . they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start . the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them . i do not agree with those saying this is iowa 2.0. this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer . skip this chapter .
1	i love this song ! nick voice is so hot ! it is always my ringtone around valentine day ! i do wish him and jess were still together but i still love it !
0	dumb
1	yes ! yes ! yes !

1	fantastic
0	wrong purchase : /
1	it is pure pink .
1	wonderful old song - not covered enough at all .
0	the whole mp3 is just noise , not good noise , not even a lot of noise but noise . what a bunch of hooey . do not click on this one . the only reason i wa looking wa i tried steve g. jones and in two night have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choice when eating . it is also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep . but this one - boo hiss stay away . glad i only wasted $ .99 . whew .
0	come on . it is christmas . really ? did she really have to make a vulgar song ? she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday ? it is the season of hope and joy , yet lady gaga is producing this . i have never had a problem with her other work . up until now that is . and to top it all off , amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion .
1	louisville represent . love supporting artist from my home state . laid back soul . you got ta listen to this .
0	sick . trash deleting asap
1	thank you so much , it is fantastic , i truly appreciate it , very very peaceful ! it is amazing the way it make you feel !
0	actually , it did not . the first tune wa nice , but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all . if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake , and i just found it too irritating .
0	this should be a lot better . however it is not . do not waste your money . sorry brian
1	i love this album ! a very anointed project !
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ! ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song ! keep up the good work
1	love it .
0	very highly sought after album . and - it is very well done . to bad it is a pirated cd . this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it , you are supporting pirated music . but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it is site . and this one , it appears , is here to stay . after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale of these type of item .
1	awesome cd . listen all the way through .
0	purchased this and it never did show up in my account .
1	great inspirational music .
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to . 1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to .
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
0	i just do not get the hype about 50 cent . i listened to this , and i think he is a , excuse the pun , two-bit talent .
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber . this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way , and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother . very inspirational !
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far ! can not wait to hear the rest of their album . the boy are awesome and so talented !
1	heard this song on the radio a few time and loved it . when i finally found out the name , i bought . it is cute and catchy , preview it and see ( hear ) for yourself = )

1	a good , clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series . to hear it would always take me back to the early 70 . now , it reminds me of that tv series .
1	i did not like it at first . after listening to it a few time , i got it . it is beautiful . lanny is a musical genius .
0	sorry all you dude who will flip over this but using god name that way over and over is childish and ignorant ! like the uneducated idiot that can not make a sentence without a foul word in it . seriously guy it unintelligent !

0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case ! i am livid !
0	nancy sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault ! she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon .

1	love it
0	when i bought this dvd i wa expecting to get the famous cali lifestyle 2 dvd . instead i got the audio cd with a small sample of creeper present cali lifestyle 2. the small sample dvd only contains about 4 minute of video footage from creeper cali lifestyle 2 dvd . if you want the full dvd contact cali finest production . you can also buy the full dvd just a long it doe not contain the audio cd . i wa very dissapointed with this purchase .
0	when wilson first broke into country music , her hit such a redneck woman , homewrecker and here for the party were cutting , fresh and brash . now her latest single , do not do me no good is just uninspired- it sound like the 101th song out there on country radio . an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is . wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself . she should just take her advice when she sings on this track , yeah i know it aint right/to sit around all night and let your memory/get the best of me .
0	ordered and paid for 3 song . only one song down loaded . amazon site said all 3 were down loaded . my e-mail to them for help wa never answered . customer service suck !
0	it is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it . it wa just some breathing noise and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy . i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling . would not reccomend
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the original artist it wa a big scam it wa a remake by some artist i never heard of
0	i have been a big boc fan since the 1970s , and have gotten most of their album along the way , but imaginos wa one that got away from me . i have seen many online comment about how great it is , and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction . so , when this reissue wa released , i had to pick it up . well . it really doe not do it for me , i am afraid . the problem is that , first of all , it doe not sound like a boc album , and , a i recently discovered , it is not . it is a solo album by bocs drummer , albert bouchard , and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera . despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger , the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another . the rather pointless re-do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with . and if you are going to call this a boc album , you have got ta have buck dharma , who get short shrift here . the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album , apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own . the album is not a total disaster ( i kind of like the baron frankenstein number ) , but i am very glad that i did not pay $ 100.00 for it on ebay ! i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja , and hope to see that happen sometime soon . ( p 07/27/08 : club ninja is coming soon ! )
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flutist that i wa looking for . i wa very disappointed that it wa not !
1	my 14 month old baby love this song . quality is great . i wanted exactly same sinsong , singed by same singer etc . and i think this is it !
0	just do not like it , i took it just to check it out and i found out i do not like it .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
0	product sucked got it and it skip very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad .
0	it sounded good on the clip . after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be .
1	love the song it is so uplifting and i play it three or four time a day just to get moving !
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy . i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one . sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample . well this wa the only full version of her retail album , so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it . i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored ! this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store . they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is a censored version when they do not offer the real version at all . now i am stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar . i feel intentionally misled .
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week . deftones is one of my favorite band .
1	my student ad i love this song and the video that made u go and buy it . it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone !
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who follow christ . i wa hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party , but can not , it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric . if i would have heard the word of the song before i bought it , i would have not .
1	lov it
0	very disappointed in this cd . it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song , too annoying to listen too .
1	for country music fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the music of schuyler , knobloch and overstreet , judy rodman , and schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt , this cd is a must for your collection . this cd cover most of the major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd . judy rodman , who wa a minor success ( and mtm record only artist before folding ) in the early to mid 80 ha several of her best known hit on this release . from the up tempo girl ride horse too to the memory laced until i met you , these two song are just a few of the hard to find gem on any cd of any type . i wa absolutely estatic to find the schuyler , knobloch and overstreet song you can not stop love in this collection . this is a song that i have searched for on cd for 3 year . this cd also ha rarity from the girl next door ( slow boat to china ) , schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt ( baby got a new baby ) , and two becky hobbs selection ( jones on the jukebox , they always look better when they are leavin ) . if you are searching for these obscure recording on cd , this offering will not disappoint you .
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. you are husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
0	his vocal are too modern country . the song are depressing and mundane . they are all too similar . it just go on for too long .
1	this is a great song with a great message . yolanda adam is one of the best gospel/inspirational singer ever . king kong aint got nothing one her ! ( lol )
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen to . i recomend it highly although i do not recomend the second set 100 more piano masterpiece .
1	great
1	love this song , reminiscent of grover washington jr. great style and warmth .
0	pearl jam is the band that basically told mtv to f- off after their first album - nirvana is the band that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout , pearl jam got huge because of their music & they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated , phony fake band ever - pearl jam is truly the greatest band ever , pearl jam stuck by their word , cobain never did fact : cobain used to call mtv & tell mtv to play nirvana music video more
0	of all the song to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track , this one about the worst you could pick . i previewed some of her other track . not great . but definitely not a bad a this track . i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one . not good .
0	did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a 50th class reunion power point presentation .
0	i downloaded it .
1	what a great song !
1	this wa a well received gift . can not go wrong with john lennon anything .
0	this is not the original version .
0	i never ordered this . i hope it wa free .
1	my kid love this song ! it is so much fun to listen to and sing along with . bonus , i do not get tired of hearing it .
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra , with mary martin doing the singing . that is the plus , a it is always a pleasure to hear her . why should not i is the third standard ( or maybe it is an almost standard ) from cole porter jubilee , and definitely a favorite song of mine . this is a very good straight version , without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it . the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse , which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric ( e.g . i must find some kind persona grata , to give me data , personally ) . for that reason , i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song .
0	ok
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this . would never listen to it ( and i tried ) .
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap . i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted . it wa adverized a being sold on amazon . i decided to buy it . so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon . but it wa not the same version ! only one verse wa in english . i felt extremely disappointed ! i wanted the english version so very much . but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what i wa led to believe i wa buying : the english version of veni sante spiritus ! do not be fooled !
0	what a lazy production from pink floyd a it is supposed last album . very disappointed .
0	i would love to give this a great review ( because i have been purchasing mp3 downloads for year from amazon ) . but after all my searching , my hard drive show no sign of this song . wish i could say more . i have tried all of the trouble shooting suggestion made by the account manager . still no luck . so . until i get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads i have ever purchase . i will have to hold off on any positive review .
1	this band is so good ! there last album wa good . this one is even better !

1	love this song !
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube . beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound . plus i love the disco beat . little known now and little info about them anymore . they were popular in europe in the early 80 . i think they were english but played a lot in germany . do not think they did much in the u .
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it .
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer , but to me , songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here , along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level . i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit - that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength . this album is more like day in the life ditty . to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper . a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this ( all original ) and which caught me fully first time through . you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle . crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection .
0	way too much applause at the end .
0	great song !
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral . and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion .
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work , yet one of his best . a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook . it is unique , it is honest and it is meaningful . the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate , a bottle of wine and quiet evening . i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this .
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret , or even fire garden . but gospel and blue type singing ? . kind of a turn off . i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album . and that hurt to say .
0	not such a great cd . only one selection meet my expectation .
1	terrific !
1	great music from a great series
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing . best of all , why should i be scared of you ? is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more . dig it .
0	i think it is so good message is great i just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star .
0	ok not what i expected
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1 ? mr. big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit . he is so emotional . it must be from the bottom of his heart
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and 2001 album - this is not it . i do not feel that this is a dr. dre album since he is not the predominant rapper , but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre . there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one . maybe he should have made detox all along . oh well .
0	love the song . hate the download process through amazon . i do not want your player amazon . you made the normal download link to small , like fine print . took me too long to figure out . made me grouchy .
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i.e . passenger . it is not and wasnt worth keeping . i tossed it in the trash . what a waste of $
0	too much talking
1	love the work wish the cd had more track !
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument . everybody think it wa korn , but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage . you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn , nickelback , and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the 1990s . almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana- monotone vocal that explode into raging scream , wall of distorted guitar noise , and whiney lyric about how miserable life is . do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll ? nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing . nirvana were not about music . they were about conformity and nothing more . just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable , immature , whiney suburban teenager from their money . they were the backstreet boy with guitar , basically . the linkin park of 88-94. i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last decade .
0	i love the original video recording , but this version add way to much instrument background music . make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song .
0	very disapointing , sound like it is playing to slow . obvisouly a recording problem .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	beautifully written and sung . a song to listen to over and over . sound quality is good especially with headphone , oh yeahhhh .
0	yuck
1	always a classic song . great quality , too .
1	the song re-interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them . this might be a christmas album , but the music is not limited to only that time of year .
0	the song is fine , but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro , like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny .
1	some of my favorite music from back in the 80 . brings back so many wonderful memory ! the cd arrived in perfect condition !
1	great voice ! this is a wonderful album to listen to . well worth the $ 5
1	wonderful music , a always by josh groban .
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album , which i think is great ! this one did not deliver like that one for me but i am still listening to it . i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening . usually for me when an album doe not hit me right away , it will a little later , well see .
0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past . the word of god renews my spirit daily !
1	love bfs ! and they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are . again ! the bitch song ha always been a favorite of mine . and i am so excited to see it back on the track list ! it is great hearing that song . new and musically improved ! : ) stacys mom just make me laugh . because for some weird reason people have thought that they have been singing it for year . and now all of those people are correct haha . and i have never done anything like this is just typical bfs stuff ! love it ! good good stuff ! : )
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. really take me back to that time , really good song .
0	problem is not the music . but they apparently sent u a blank . four different cd player and not a one can read it . holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track .
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass . this portion is so moving , i can listen to it over and over .
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song . if this is a good a his song writing get , he need to set down the pen . god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single . i can not help but think of fergie when i hear this song . it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump . except , in this situation , there is a man singing it . it make my stomach churn a i think about it . are there no good male songwriter left in this country !
0	not to much into the hard rock sound .
0	music wa too high i could not use the soundtrack . i tried with my soprano and they could not sing to the soundtrack .
1	the story wa good . the music wa so so . we hail from new jersey . and grew up listening to the four season . we used to follow them intensely . wherever they were appearing . we know their sound . the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong . he wa singing to falsetto . you know over doing . this is our opinion , but then again we are jersey girl !
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel , the da song soon ! and narration by chuck smith . really , if you have shotgun angel , there is little reason to buy this . if you do not have shotgun angel , get it instead . if you are buying this for the song soon ! ( which is the weakest song on it ) get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead . if you are buying this for the narration , it is not worth it . i can not criticize the biblical passage , though not particularly well read ; but the interpretive part is not well done . i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement , but i knew this would be the case before buying the album ; i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile - and it would have , had i not already had all the song . the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision . i really felt like only giving this one star , but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for , were they not better found in their original context ( shotgun angel ) .
1	this song is awesome . i am not a huge fan of three day grace , but this is by far my favorite .
1	prince wa ahead of his time on this one . my grandchild like it and the older one understand it too .
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf
0	would not download . error in file name .
1	nice
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album . i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them . so i will not spend the money to buy the entire album . when this song is available to download individually , let me know and you just might get a sale .
1	i love his music and message
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic . unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up . i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl , but the seller did list this a good condition yet 90 % of it wa unplayable . very disappointed .
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer .
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life , including a year in vietnam . i used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little . but . . .i really do not think ten new song is all that great . i am glad someone gave it to me , tho .
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in . not good to work out to .
0	love the band , but there only one good song on this release . seriously , anything that say feat . in it is passe and unoriginal . if you are so good , why do you need help ? it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together , and now everyone is doing it . seriously , keep the dj out . none of the good one know wtf they are doing . i will pas on this one . collide is much better , and 13 song at that .
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive , it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office . one minute you are straining to hear the word , the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down . susan boyle voice is low , almost a mumble , and she sound like a little girl- not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection . i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it .
0	i purchased the mp3 but could not download it . i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again . it doe not work and all the thing they told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to contacting them . they were no help and i am out .99 ( big deal ) but still have no song .
0	i did not like it because i wa looking for lp not single . anyways , i sent it back and i wa quickly processed for money return . it wa needing more information on the add .
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument . undoubtedly , sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra , the london classical player , are a highlight of this recording . the music is played with precision , a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically . what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the 5th symphony , which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording . norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work - his interpretation of beethoven 2nd and 8th symphony are , in some way , his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle . i listened to the 5th yesterday , when i wa feeling very low , and it put me in a much better frame of mind . we all need music like this sometimes . i have needed it a lot lately . sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having . i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it . modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous , heavy and stodgy . a recording for people who like fresh , crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar , washed down with chilled chardonnay , and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat , stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table !
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
1	good song .
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co-writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception . however , unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album , this song is not very magical . in fact , it fall flat on the floor . the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time . the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to . sorry , lenny . maybe next time ! 2 star . end note : at least he still look good though . i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt , and le clich and boring . this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic .
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack , never in my life . never thought i would , for that matter . but , after watching tron : legacy , i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie , but i loved the music ! it is amazing , a this review title say . : ) i usually always have playing on my mp3 player thousand foot krutch and fm static , my favorite band . so i thought it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff ( since tfk is hard rock ) , but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning . i would definitely recommend this album . get the whole thing . it rule . and , btw , i am becoming a very big tron fan , thanks to this awesome cd ! and i watched the first tron , and i really really enjoyed that one . i think everyone need to watch that one if they have seen , or are going to see , the second one , because it really help to understand it all . thank you all you tron people !
1	this song came out in the 90 and i remember having this cd at the time . this wa one of their big hit along with i want u. i love this song because the group came along with a new sound . they were in when grunge rock ruled , but along come savage garden , what a blessing . the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric , i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic , 80 , an 90 . a great band for those of u who whated something besides those grunge band . kris l. cockayne
1	rip
1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
0	i am so disappointed in the last 3 i bought b/c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song , rearranged or in a different language . this is very poor representation especially for a new group . whoever made those decision should be fired . their objective should b to make new follower , not loose them . i have purchased 15 dvd a present and 2 new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label .
0	the song is great . but , this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song , making it impossible for me to listen to .
0	one song for $ 9.99 ? i guess it is my fault that i did not read the product description , but i wa under the impression , for that price , that i wa getting a full length cd .
0	back in the very early 90 , i had this ( the cassette tape version ) and thought it wa amazing . until i bought the cd recently , i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me . it wa almost painful to listen to , and i remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music ! i would only recommend this for laugh or a 90 nostalgia night .
1	fabulous music , love the violin and the piano in the background . the music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me . one of the best cd ever !
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame a rape victim
1	yeah buffett .
0	not good
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak , however , not stating this is 45 second long is almost misrepresenting itself . in fact , it is . listen to the free clip - you have heard 70 % of the interview . shame on you , amazon !
1	great song , long length . thought provoking . brings back good memory from the 90 . you will ask yourself . where wa i when i heard that ?
0	imo , this sound like something i couldve done with a toy saxophone . awful . listen to the preview . if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great , then go for it .
1	i just like it .
0	definitely need to be remastered .
0	not my kind of music , downloaded them for a funeral
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor : when i first heard her 4 or 5 year ago , i thought , wow ! she is really unique and awesome ! . then came her next record and i thought . hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it . she ha managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight record . i think that is a record or something ( pun intended ) . i just want to tell her , yea , we have got it , you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million time for effect .
0	i am not a music critic , i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for . i can simply say i did not enjoy the album . one , maybe 2 good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list . i hope they , zac brown band , plan to get back to country again soon . still listening to all of their other album daily .
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me . mean a lot !
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie , but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother . this audio encounter is not by the mayles , and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party . the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck . the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive . i do not know the timing of this production but big edie ( mum ) doe not seem to take part at all . the appeal of little edie had always been her expression , body language , and refreshing vocal ; this production did not stimulate at all , and wa frankly a little humdrum .
0	this is not the full song , it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration . i actually want my money back . do not buy !
0	did not download a expected , emailed amazon , no answer !
1	it is great ! i love it
1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70 . other hit song by them were hey , nineteen , rikki do not lose that number , deacon blue and do it again .
0	i absolutely love this song ! however , the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible . it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it . it did only cost $ .25 so i guess i will live with it .
1	perfect . a described . thank you
1	another big streisand winner album . great collaboration duo .
1	i love this song ! download wa smooth and simple . burn to disc wa fine . will download more music from amazon .
1	road trip music
0	for the elevator or dentist office . i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here . but i wa a big fan . and yes , i gave the cd several try , all the way through . even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album . it is just milk toast . dull , uninspired and uninspiring . sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm ( really ? ) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out , and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off . yes , mumfords voice is gorgeous , but not enough to save the album . hey , fame and fortune is tough , but they made it through 27. i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited .
0	despite this being a label album , it really just another flame album . v rose only get one track to herself , and it the forgettable threw it all away . ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference , the label ha stuck with their two artist . yes , a lot of various artist from reach record , cross movement , and beyond are brought in to add flavor , but it flame project without question . and it ok , but it not a good a flame usual stuff , which ha been declining a of late in my opinion . i am kinda disappointed , a the guest did not shine particularly bright either , so i will give it a 2 , maybe a 2.5 no knock on the message , thats great . but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall .
0	the version of the song is not my favorite . unfortunately , i think this is the only version released . i even tried to find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able .
0	ok
0	i want a new online music store , i want a new music store , one that do not just sell mp3s , one that will sell me original cd quality downloads , one that will take the time to respect the music , one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should . seriously bought one single just to test it out , cause i do not want to pay $ 40 , for the original cd ( reprint ) . i am not a audio snob , but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup . i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format . i would gladly pay an extra $ 5 dollar or whatever for wav handling , i do not think this is too much to ask . amazon or itunes can not seem to comprehend this .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
0	quality of recording is not perfect ? * %
0	wow . a christmas album featuring a rhodes ! ? i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room , so i wa elated to see this cd . but it is not played on a rhodes . it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard , complete with cheezy drum track . it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano . what a disappointment . all the song are very stiff , a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live . i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title .
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased . i will find something better . not worth it .
1	great album ! i am in love !
1	i could not wait for bruno to drop his new album . i love his style . i grew up listening to different genre of music . my mom wa r & b . dad loved funk/soul and all true 80 baby should love new jack swing . he wa able to incorporate all of it on 1 album . hand down a masterpiece . whole album on repeat .
0	ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information . wa not like the picture . returned 1st one and ordered a second which wa identical to the first . also wa returned .
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon-to-be christmas classic ! well done , p-unit !
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy .
0	i wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not .
0	pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd . forgettable .
0	no rocky top ? ! ? why bother ? that is like warm beer & cold pizza , close but not quite .
1	stylistically , i love all type of music . but , how do i classify fireflights album , for those who wait album - is it indie , is it rock - i do not know ? but , what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work ! drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band - with fireflight , there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person - and , the driving vocal of pat benatar , and pop musicality of the go-gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs . ( thanks , pooh for the great word , smackerl , you silly ole bear ) . yet , although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular-bands-of-yore-oh-so-great in fireflights unique sound - i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh - and dare i say anointed ? check out the band website - [ . ] . they have their video available for your viewing pleasure . there is a genuine story being told in each song - i assure you .
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style . i wa very disappointed . his sound doe not work with these song . it is not enjoyable . the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic , which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound , but the choice of song wa wrong . sorry bob !
0	i very rarely bother to write a review , unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something . unfortunately this is the latter . i have always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak , materialistic , egotistical , club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 year now . though every album ha had a different feel to it , i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.this album is slowwwwwed down . tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music . not everything ha to be 300 mile per hour of awesomeness , but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either . the dj wa completely uninspired . i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist . usually a complex mixture of big brass , synthesizer , different time signature , other genre of music thrown in , and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around , this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music . the lyric are amazing a usual , you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album ( the only reason i am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 ) dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd.most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good , then slows down horrifically for the last two parts.there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album.the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n9ne cd . sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system . not the reason i buy tech n9ne . if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays . like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time . he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo . i am sure it will sell well . i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n9ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again .
1	keeping it real .
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
1	there were a couple of top 40 song from this album , but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound .
1	you can not help but tear up when listening to this song . it is an amazing song amd lea made it even better !
1	great music . very inspirational .
1	love this vinyl
1	always liked simon & garfunkel .
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of 52 year . what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer .
0	i downloaded this track by accident . this is the live version of the song . i wanted the original studio version .
0	ok cd . a few good song but not worth the buy . obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend , this will work
0	i came to this wanting to like it . i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever . i have all of rogers solo work , seen him a few time back in the 80 on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour . i am a fan . my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak . if life is really that bad , get a puppy ! i mean , i find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this - i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash . i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here ? i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig ( three different one ) and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death , another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak , i got rid of it . then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it . i never listen to it . this is music to depress yourself to . who need that ? if i want to be depressed i will watch the news . i do not need to hear it in my music . life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race . i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song .
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone . i just love to listen to him sing
1	one of conways sexy song .
1	awesome song !
0	i am from mxico . i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality , too much surface noise and not very good sound . i decided not to get the next one . but when my favorite maiden album ( this one and 7th son ) came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity . i have to say it wa the same disappointment . they do not even sound nearly a my 80 uk edition . whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection . i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl . too much surface noise and tick and pop . please , if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl .
0	please get it off my kindle i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough those of u with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of .
1	that voice , this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe . love is grand , so appreciate it . because everything fade away .
1	great
1	great song !
0	did not like the song at all . i remove it from my download . very disappointed in the way it is song and the music .
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app
1	beautiful song
0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 piece . mine only downloaded 100 .
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me . how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric ? better songwriting is definitely in order .

1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again . she is back and this album outshines believe . cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful voice to send these song through the roof . song for the lonely will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today . alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible . when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track . people - buy this album . let u put cher at number 1 again where she belongs !
1	love it .
1	incredible musical talent and so inspirational ! love love love it !
0	really misleading . it is more of a 10 minute show than a full length one . lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it .
0	basically my sister ( 16 year old ) is listening to this garbage in the other room , and it is aggravating ; i do not like shopping at the mall , and this music is teleporting me there . it is the definition of insipid , and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy , and thus spending dough . in other word , this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience . it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though . to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small , and the world at large . anyone who like this doe not like music , but i would not know , i do not like music either-i like mogwai-good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock . for if it dunnae rock ti piss
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite . his first three album are off the chart . but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop . what a bad album . ive waited this long for this . i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound . he need a producer , some one to make dope beat . this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it . im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more . at least the wu keep it real . built for cuban link 2 wa great . reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music ?
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be . a lot of the song i have never heard before .
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video . i did not like the rap in the middle , did not seem to fit the song .
1	thank you
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol , boring !
1	this is so sweet . frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon , but listening carefully , and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night . frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis , blind boy fuller and john jackson . this guitar-as -piano style , in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note , is a rich sound , one at which frank is very much in control . from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change , frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint . the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite . highly recommended .
1	love this song !
0	total ripoff ! this is not the whole song , it is like a 30 second sound bite from the song . i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for $ 1.29 . save yourself a buck and do not buy this .
1	when the name van mccoy come up , if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late 1970s , it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle . mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to # 1 on the billboard hot 100 in 1975 , and wa billboard # 22 most popular song of that year . fast forward a year to 1976 , where mccoy released another song with a similar , albeit lighter sound , called the shuffle . though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial ( and maybe it got used that way at some point ) , it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music . i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song , but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go . if you do , perhaps you will clue u in !
0	the background is not a background ! you can listen the kid singing
0	gardian - voyager & fusion ( 2001 - millenium eight record ) 1 ) instrumental intro 2 ) voyager 3 ) across the universe 4 ) run to the light ( early version of one of a kind ) 5 ) in a world without love ( early version of world without love ) 6 ) i am here ( tony sings and play guitar on this track ) 7 ) prisoner zone 8 ) look to the future 9 ) hyperdrive ( early version of the re-recorded bonus track for first watch ) 10 ) when the time is right 11 ) marching on ( early version of the re-recorded bonus track for first watch ) 12 ) spiritual warfare 13 ) miracle of the galaxy ( early version of miracle ) 14 ) living for the promise ( early version of livin for the promise ) 15 ) eclipse ( not on first watch ) 16 ) rock in victory ( early version of rock in victory ) 17 ) step to the light ( very early version of one of a kind ) 18 ) armored defense 19 ) your love look to the future * = fusion - rock in victory ( ep ) ( 1984 ) ( six song ep - but not sure if it is all here ? ) ( i believe only the last three song are from riv . ) ? = gardian - voyager ( 1987 ) ( how many track on this ? do not know what track are from this , and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from ( maybe a demoed first watch tape or something ? ) * = from the california metal ( comp . ) ( 1987 ) ? = demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff . not sure which were on voyager ? - james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory , tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track . to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff . could not find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager . it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last 3 track ( 17-19 ) . - they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory & voyager . so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here ? - so overall this sound like s * t - but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix . would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up . tony shred !

0	after a couple of day , song refused to play . had to download from another server .
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song . it really resonates with the pain i am current healing from . thank you , plumb .
1	tragically , it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world , the great natalie cole . but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie , is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart . something that many of her diva like rihanna , beyonc , britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all . instead , they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone . natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the 80 , that nearly derailed her career and her life . in the 90 , she made peace with the passing of her beloved father , nat king cole , and went into jazz music , after year of r & b . but she had some great song for everyone alone . a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end . she flexed her sweet , and beautiful voice in the movie track , with the same title name from 1997. it is a lovely song , and i think of this song from natalie , a one of her best in her lifetime . it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love . i miss natalie so much , but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice , with a deep heart . natalie cole : 1950-2015 song : b+
0	problem with amazon music

1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever . the movie is great , and so is the soundtrack . kevin spacey doe a great job all around !
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music . i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment . i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition . hey ry , stick to music for everyone .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
0	ok
0	i do not understand how this album won award . i would ask for my money back if i could .
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd . i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand . with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere . i really do not know how to describe how i feel . it is not bad music , it is not a bad album . but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band - i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it . i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford & son - other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have . i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke , this is not going to be one of them . it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because - dare i say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing . i am not going to purchase new - i will wait for used and cheaper . not that i think amazon is asking too much - i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar . sorry mumford & son , the album is ok but not what we really liked you for .
0	audio is terrible
1	i love me some brad paisley .
0	from [ . ] , dated august 17 , 2008 : the compilation album a closer end , that recently started appearing on the p2p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store , is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg . it is very convincingly made , with a century medium logo , fake barcode and extensive booklet , but it is nevertheless a bootleg . it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing , but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not , and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography , presented a a legitimate release , we feel the need to set the record straight .
1	fantastic voice that jive well with the retro sound . like a dark , smokey pink martini . i do not have five more word .
