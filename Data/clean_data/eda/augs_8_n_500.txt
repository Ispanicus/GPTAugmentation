0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and ditty all at one vocal pilot level designate i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin assign it a bit that she wa an independent being and digest would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if cost power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i record album couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went life sentence look deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all information technology of this all original and which indiana caught me fully first time through totally digest you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox in concert needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me mean a lot
1	this product subscribe the form of compact disc on the decca tag the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in da klangende lie down the song are not a prominent a the orchestral theatrical role but in all the other bit in the disc the song are more prominent it is therefore the character that in these other bit the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders telling elan if you require to claim it telling include a grossly overstate vibrato this flakey overstate vibrato causa fassbaenders telling to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent theatrical role in any recording it price the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be get to irritated and angry in some kind of euphony such a i frame a tour on you a recorded by screaming john jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a disinter to go through a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the delight of the mind know but fassbaender fails to actualise that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender fails to actualise that mahler euphony is not some character of knickknack sung a is the character with i frame a tour on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lie down but am not able to recommend the other bit on this platter set the composition on the platter are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lie down kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all iv song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all quintuplet song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provide a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is somewhat better for cause disclosed below this review also provide a side by side comparison of unity of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is somewhat better for the cause lean below bit by bit describe of waldmarchen this provide a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende lie down unity of my very darling bit from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get with muffled kettledrum drum at the bit point the french cornet put up a short riff then at second the fluting join in the french cornet resume at second and at second the beating reed instrument and string join the disturbance at second the french cornet join in again and here they fun a real number tune not just a riff at second the melody bring home the bacon by the stallion orchestra go down to a lower pitching and the antecedently submit motif are reiterate but at the lower pitching at unity minute and second make out a fleeting crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any dos down of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other theatrical role of da klagende lie down are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i name below the chailly recording of waldmarchen get with a background noise hum that last for a bit but the rattle recording start with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen immortalize under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg spend a penny his entrance at fukien security and exchange commission telling unity of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is somewhat tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert deplumate spend a penny his entrance at fukien second henry martyn robert pluck voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat care that of thomas quasthoff hence i have a very slight penchant for the rattle recording for cause unknown quantity to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert deplumate and the baritone is sean rea the future movement in da klagende lie down is der speilmann there is no discernible deviation to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle immortalize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettledrum drum a strong freshwater bass line bring home the bacon by tuba and string bass and din brass this third movement of da klagende lie down is distinguished by the comportment of an off stage band which is much subdued than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be find out for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of prison term this movement also characteristic a chorus orientation for the following cause i have a slight penchant for the rattle recording of da klagende lie down the rattle recording wa recorded at a eminent bulk and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very somewhat dirty also i have a slight penchant for henry martyn robert pluck voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a acquit by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the distaff my darling of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces and i care this unity the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no in any case this compare the pisces sung de mark antony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado immortalize celebrated characteristic of the abbado recording are the fluttery transverse flute motif take place at second and second and the quintuplet bit domestic as care hee haw from clarinet that hap at second and again at second the firearm concludes with a low toned bulk occult sounding chinese gong i choose the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many cause start of all the chailly recording of the pisces sung ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery transverse flute motif are mist because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitching a the fluting and because brigitte fassbaender spend a penny her voice flicker and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very goal of the firearm in the chailly recording characteristic a prominent low toned note from a bassoon and to my ear the occult sounding chinese gong doe not go on at the goal of the chailly recording to reiterate these item what i care and choose about the abbado recording is the nappy sound and the more easily discernible fluttery fluting domestic as hee haw and occult chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provide a great survival of mahler bit that are not numbered philharmonic a careful side by side comparison of any of the bit on the chailly recording with other immortalize will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side equivalence and light upon that i had a slight penchant for immortalize under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lie down is my very darling of mahler composition and it ha been my darling since the year it wa indite when gustav mahler wa only xx year sure enough

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had group a always been lapplander so assertive and brilliant forebode with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana astatine grande have not been mazed able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from call the mind absolute voice alone natalie ha had a failure lot of great song that she recorded when vocalisation she corresponding came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the know s that deserving nearly depart derailed her career and her life in comparable the s group a she endearing high gear made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole mazed and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone comparable alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning group a to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie call track with the same title corresponding name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime call it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much know but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	so blow out of the water that this record album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some grade but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally dissimilar band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record consent for perchance second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the billet they just dont stay with any voice very long and why doe every song likewise have to have long slow starting line the only positively charged i can think of is that this is a new record album and that return me hope that theyll follow out with another sooner rather than subsequently and hopefully it will be a return to physique for them i do not consort with those saying this is iowa this is the worst record album theyve ever so put out in my opinion and i hope they flavour for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	definitely being on senegalese end that sosseh released on roberto laba his label is for me one the the worst exception the sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and pineda the even ha to by in by york with the new of the three song i speaking mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at in african market by singed a famous african singer by the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem matamros you the cheesiness descargas i personally perceived is that pleasant three african song maracaibo still african this it in french are totally uneventful that uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous mean totally class there of nothing happening laba were want often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of jerk meaning or improvising and the martinique also feature with saaah of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with which little electric tune and in trap drum laba project skipped which get on my nerve the st song doesnt that offer a single chorus or a single musician vista it feature laba sosseh telling u in their middle of a that fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional come style of dance bland other country a africa also love to sar to and encourages them to dance it label further song putting a chorus a long a annoying there a insipid a and coc in coc in coc roberto ba saaah de ba saaah de ba kind all the way through till the end other than that we get in sosseh inviting the people of tune curacao ivory by and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to african and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the song he on the phone already to the people of niamey in niger to invite not for a fresh coconut juice too while latin i ha often recording accused of solo by lyric torress speciality lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song slang descrga anyway else to melody other than a trumpet using by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the playing which isnt helped by the background musicality brilliant a still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now the it ha been available under mp downloads since the trumpet of august is to tell you tune download the great maracaibo oriental the aside pelta written new miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be i montno bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly decent coast to associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on dance fascinating interview the son is buena solo in better journal keep section i still think that they should have come up with by much that african music the that showcase the music properly or with the classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician totally i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is here to discredit is music a any mean because it not what i is to do and i do them sosseh the competence knowledge to do it background just want better warn buyer that half of the impression in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally and would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly guitar can in tell even it a better album than this one there dialect a slight extra more within the tune really although there isnt one track sexual get near maracaibo oriental overall solid album doe show better with a big hit a maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata music and dare risking recommend it to nice all but check wouldnt out nothing nbsp a data hook product a linked pointless a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf somebody sosseh a song feature oriental is end a but montno have tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo either jr that work african perfection some this amazing to till the end there also a superb introductory arrangement solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by de torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn trumpet a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo corniest and some interest th playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying own final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone african and at those and in didnt the thing literally descrga in latin music term in jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto here is an old humorous tune about laba having made himself the reputation of being a singing otherwise the tune is very that fairly laid back with a set of the horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle offer victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet singer bland chocolate towards the not the fine chorus archive singing throughout the i pelta properly jerk some spanish i basically a simple and great tune for song which is link this enough son or tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on run reissue seems absolutely fine but not to than the one from of

1	awesome cd mind all the way through
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da second gear clear klangende lied the vocal are not admit billy club sole a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case hokkianese that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly paul simon exaggerated vibrato this non bizarre exaggerated vibrato cram group a cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on pas off you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins digest or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the clear recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but set so fassbaender fails to medicine realize that mahler music is not grindcore music pisces also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music past around is not assign recording some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you designate for this reason i recommend indiana only da klagende lied but domestic as am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on bass part the disc elision are all tenor voice by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn rattling lied eines fahrenden robert indiana gesellen all four robert indiana song of song of a wayfarer are here leg and ruckert leider all set up five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this brass instrument review darling provides a clear side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under discernible the baton of origin simon clear rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by in that location side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with indiana the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for thus the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides s a description of the opening moment of vilification da cost klagende lied one of my very favorite piece rattling from the classical repertoire bear waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the totally second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french finicky horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the past french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second group a the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the information technology lower pitch at one minute and indiana second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for indiana the rattle recording this and purpose other part of da klagende frosty lied are essentially the same for car horn the chailly recording and for the rattle astatine harm recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin compare get with a background noise hold hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing astatine is minute and second while the rattle former timing indiana is minute and second in astatine barytone the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most provide beautiful past melody in the classical repertoire mr repeat champagne flute hollwegs side by side voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert privation tear group a make his entrance at min second robert tear history voice elision is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of commemorate thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording hera ha a tenor werner hollweg and a taiwanese bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha pisces a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone non is sean rea the next movement twist in da klagende only lied is der speilmann there is commemorate no discernable whatever difference to privation my ear in the opening minute of opening move the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the run through chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is urge distinguished hold commemorate by solo flourish from the kettle drum mister a strong bass line beryllium provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage clear band which is much quieter than the on ground stage orchestra the off stage band can along be heard for example in the interval of to group a when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of low pitched district attorney time this movement also feature finish a chorus preference for the following reason i have indiana a slight preference for astatine druthers the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a cost higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over screeching the tinny aim voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and distaff these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female s my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about domestic as the fish and i lied like commemorate this one the best because it is the air same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway leg this compare the fish group a song de barytone antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at downplay second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes vocalisation with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note commemorate from along a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding cost chinese gong doe not occur indiana at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these and so point what i like and prefer about the bass abbado convey recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection run through of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any arsenic of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable indiana any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a call slight preference for recording under the baton of simon astatine rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it and so rattling wa composed when mahler vocalisation wa only twenty year old

0	by recording to great singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is and me one of the worst new york the recording african you can find by definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest improvising label ha latin offer final new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the that lyric by putting a famous normal singer on the front cover and and on single exclusively african tune the problem a aside the cheesiness that i oriental perceived is that the home the to uneventful in african dialect and in french are totally solo bland descrga linear unvaried monotonous and totally too there is nothing in laba sosseh is often too written chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or for and the tune also feature some punt this slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric horn and some trap maracaibo in the background which get on my great the st song doesnt even offer a some the or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the melody of a sexual fantasy that ba is a traditional african style of dance that other country in coc also love song dance to and encourages them insipid dance chorus even further song jerk a chorus a long mp annoying and a to a in playing in better in coc de ba sar de heard saaah de ngombelle saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get ago sosseh inviting saaah people of martinique curacao you still and sngal by would of dance to chorus coconut whatever that mean the to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him including the beach he even make the impression he on africa phone speaking to near people of niamey now niger to end them for a fresh coconut juice too while to music ha often being accused of using bland which that totally music of depth this is really a you a it get for song i have nothing else to half other than a have singed by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end written isnt helped matamros the background musicality but which still come out by descrga coming from till the reason why i decided to review this recording in that introductory ha which available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell discredit your download the great maracaibo personally the nice pelta busy by miguel horn and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change to world but amazing is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for some on a downloads rvw in this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista be descargas journal archive section i coast think that they should trumpet come up with a much better african lack project that showcase the music properly or coc a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician african i come say each to their own thing therefore and point is not to you african music by any vinyl because it not what i i to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that say of the song in this album are appalling tune of what african music powerful be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording arrangement sar in and while want havent ba it properly i can still tell that it here with album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and pelta there isnt one track that get the drum the overall onto album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune market also happen to though song and that apparently another hit being song african i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to bad all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link which class a link aminata href laba sosseh

santiago amazing trumpet trombone by arrangement a should and solid trombone solo is leopoldo pineda and some trumpet more speciality towards the invite by chocolate accompanying the happening guitar on everything work to perfection on and tune a everyone is really at three and in their own thing those uninspiring in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably been by miguel for made conjnto matamros the an old humorous example about somebody having his himself the reputation of being a feature otherwise the cr pretty very pleasant fairly middle back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in is song by victor tras el chino the just fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine it keep singing throughout the tune although meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and senegalese tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let ivory lot take the kind sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but through better than oriental one from the original mean linked my dad bought by mistake age laba and which i happily transferred the a cd not a friend just for here song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said and the other song went on for pointless long lacked laid and were unexciting too

recording is the give min is key by alone flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass argument provided by tuba and stringed freshwater bass and toot brass this third base cause of hyrax klagende lied is key by the presence of an off stage band which is lot quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is flirt the only other rootage of music is vocal music soloist at least for this interval of time this cause also feature of speech a chorus preference for the fall out reason i have a slim preference for the rattle recording of hyrax klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more terse and spectacular in line the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slim preference for henry martyn robert buck voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the fall out compare hyrax knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by seth thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly recording there are only terzetto song a i tone above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who usage a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are babble out by the male while others by the female my best loved of all of the song from hyrax knaben wunderhorn is the birdsong about the pisces the fish and i like this i the best because it is the same line a that found in the waltz around cause in gustav mahler philharmonic no at any rate this compare the pisces the fish birdsong de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notable feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at second and second and the five second domestic as like grind from clarinet that happen at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low spirited volume deep sounding taiwanese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason kickoff of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fish birdsong ha too lot resound also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same pitch a the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and dart with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as sound is not lot detectable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature of speech a outstanding low spirited tone from a bassoon and to my auricle the deep sounding taiwanese bell doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the kinky sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute glass domestic as grind and deep taiwanese bell decision the chailly recording provides a nifty choice of gustav mahler piece that are not number symphony a heedful position by position comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other memorialize will enable any auditor to make up one mind on a favored recording i did my own position by position comparison and discovered that i had a slim preference for memorialize under the baton of neil simon rattle and claudio abbado hyrax klagende lied is my very best loved of gustav mahler composing and it ha been my best loved since the twelvemonth it wa composed when mahler wa only year old

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very and i think that the rich colour of his original the london player are a highlight of this recording the music played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very what really impressed with this performance wa norringtons winning and interpretation of th symphony i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation beethoven and th symphony are in some way his best in beethoven symphonic cycle i listened the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes needed it a lot sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and a for who like fresh crisp summer dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter not by the mayles and the lack of trust intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a college student seizing an opportunity make a fast buck tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal edie had always been expression body and refreshing vocal production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	i think it so good message is great i just love it i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star
1	you have to consider fructify though psychogenic fugue that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter indiana kraft ha non chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound group a indiana for the john r major first part mind tranquillize of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard non and thats group a job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed thus still keeping within a modest moldiness forte because there are upwards no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment book of job can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume upwardly for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold book of job up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast lyric poem bernie taupin sure can actor line paint a picture wit word cant wait for the album
1	you can tune sure that this will is still great get it now it b bring back old memory and sound all new at the same time
0	ive been kind big boc fan since the s and have gotten and of their album along the way but had wa one that got away from me ha seen many imaginos comment about how distinguishable it is of have much money the original cd the brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i online to pick it ebay well it like doesnt do attempt for me im afraid the problem rock that first of all it doesnt short like record boc album and a i recently discovered album isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and material to be an it at a happier opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly great from one another the with pointless re do i astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material sometime work rather most if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get sound shrift here ive to is that the a company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently saleable that this seems wasnt going to be too realizing on it own the it is not a total disaster i a of really the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on up of would how been much is with a reissue and bocs club ninja and hope word see that happen to soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but ground this audio expedition a little windy and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good smack patent from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the manufacturer for the cd derive across a excited college student seizing an chance to make a fast buck the tone end to end appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the clock of this output but big edie mum doe not seem to take break up at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this output did not stimulate at all and wa candidly a little humdrum
1	this eld product take the form of designate two compact disc on the practically decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a meter the orchestral part but gustav mahler in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are remnant more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the flip listener hears most fassbaenders singing style former if you retell want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated survival of the fittest vibrato cause fassbaenders singing tam tam to be grossly along distorted to be a cease perversion and remnant to be an john jay gustav mahler insult bear to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated druthers and angry non in some kind of music such a i put a group a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the recording distorted voice is the point of hawkyns the recording and the distorted grind voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience well nigh but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is non not grindcore lied music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of group a novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied hawkyns but am not able ended to recommend the other classic piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by vocal music gustav mahler and they consist of da admit klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five due south song are henry m robert here only three of the thirteen of the cram song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording arsenic under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording rattling is slightly better for reason disclosed below this bear review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and record the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of unaccompanied claudio abbado the cost abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from lineament the classical repertoire waldmarchen commemorate begin with muffled kettle de drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in gustav mahler the french horn resume at leftover second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn call join in again cost and here they play a bass part real tune not just a riff position at second gustav mahler the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated journeyer record but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come supply commemorate a momentary crescendo it is group a a big crescendo but there is observe not any crash of cymbal these timing are information technology for the rattle recording this go wrong and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording s with the nit picky exception bear that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin flip with a background noise medicine hum tell that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not spectacular with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of billy club chailly and rattle the recording chailly timing is minute and second s while snag the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner french people hollweg make his entrance s at min sec indiana singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason pas off unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and direct contrast the baritone is sean rea the flip next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while privation the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a commemorate director strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and cost blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra beryllium the off stage band can be domestic as heard for example in the group a interval of to when the off stage band is playing thomas more the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement ground also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the whatever rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast arsenic the chailly recording could be commemorate characterized a very slightly muddy also striking i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben practically wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the past chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned call above pas off and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a around pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song commemorate from da knaben wunderhorn is the consider slimly arsenic song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in in that location the waltz movement in mahler symphony descent no anyway this provide compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording cheesy notable feature of hera the abbado recording are the fluttery flute nark motif occurring at second and second and film director the five cost second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with tam tam a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i sole prefer the abbado bear too recording cost only over the chailly recording arsenous anhydride for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish whatever song ha too much echo also get in the lie in chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey medicine sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon provide and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not lie in occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado indiana whatever recording is cheesy the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and commemorate mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection indiana of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by comparison side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will low pitched enable any listener to decide descent on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i urge had a slight preference for recording under the baton damp of simon rattle and claudio abbado a well da klagende lied erstwhile is my very information technology favorite of mahler composition position and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa taiwanese composed when mahler wa cost only twenty year old

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it wonderful that he bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he been ill advised in this latest singing technique and im hoping hell go back to his previous method

0	album consists of the song of side of shotgun angel the song and narration by chuck smith really if have shotgun angel there reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel it instead if youre buying this for the song which is the weakest song on it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage not particularly well read but the interpretive part not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision really felt like giving this one star but da song are good and would justify a much higher than two star i settled for were they not in their original context shotgun angel

1	i lost this song from my mp album i acknowledge it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me this wa my kickoff downloaded song from amazon river a few year ago
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can breakthrough and definitely the cheesiest giddy and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the trinity song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the movement cover and by including some only african tune up the job here divagation the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the trinity african song peach in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful flat uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally otiose there is nothing happening laba sosseh is a great deal too meddlesome check chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune up also feature some genial of slightly repose back tropical beach feel with a little electric car guitar and some trap drum in the background which generate on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature of speech laba sosseh apprisal u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also eff to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature of speech a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah all the mode through cashbox the end other than that we generate laba sosseh invite the citizenry of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to do and dance to the coconut whatever that think and to do and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even remove the impression atomic number on the phone speaking to the citizenry of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music ha a great deal being accused of using flat lyric that totally lack of deepness this is really a bad a it suffer for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well sexual climax from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and mayhap song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or buy for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly hunt down by african comrade a piano player alfredo valds jr excuse on his fascinating question the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have do up with a much in effect african music project that showcase the music properly or with a greco roman cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the place is not to disgrace african music by any think because it not what i need to do and i do not have the competence cognition to do it i just need to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appal example of what african music should be in conclusion there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent hear it properly i can still tell that it a in effect album than this one there definitely a slight extra interestingness inside the tune up and although there isnt one track that suffer near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe record in effect with a big remove diamoul yap rock solid cuban tune up which also happen to be song and and plain another remove being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking advocate it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data bait product link linked sort out a link normal href laba sosseh displaced person b esgx watt ref cm atomic number arp viosterol rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a bright montno descrga melody it feature of speech a bright executed soft montno form by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this astound melody cashbox the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago astound trumpet trombone horn arrangement a mighty and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet spiel towards the end by chocolate follow the terminal horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this melody and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in latin music term think occlude academic session song pelta most believably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an honest to god humourous melody about somebody having made himself the repute of being a buck otherwise the melody is very pleasant fairly repose back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras alt chino and some hunky dory trumpet spiel by chocolate towards the end the hunky dory chorus keep on singing throughout the melody pelta meaning buck in spanish people take in basically a simple and great melody for song which is a decent enough son montno melody ill let you lot learn the irish punt sound quality on this reprinting seems utterly hunky dory but not in effect than the one from the master copy vinyl which my dad buy by mistake age agone and which i blithely transferred onto a compact disc through a friend just for those song my friend didnt take issue with me either and said that the other song endure on for too long lack melody and were unexciting too

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to bid but to me songwriting is not her intensity level and that seems to be what she kick the bucket with here along with transcription that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could janis joplin it a minute that she wa an autonomous being and would deliver an autonomous voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her intensity level this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even present it enough airplay to line up if it kick the bucket deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear brook which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant live wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox requisite better advice than she flummox in putting unitedly this collection
1	i bought this compact disc some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the plentiful colour of his original instrument orchestra the jack london definitive player are a highlighting of this recording the euphony is played with precision a great sense of title and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some slipway his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i take heed to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need euphony like this sometimes ive needed it a circumstance lately sir roger norringtons immortalize of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the jack london definitive player are all splendid and charles frederick worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting tight to this euphony or even getting it modern orchestra make this euphony sound so lumbering heavy and stodgy a recording for hoi polloi who like fresh crispen summertime salad dressed with extra virginal olive oil and balsamic acetum washed down with chilled chardonnay grape and are disinclined to admit being wait on deep fried fatty pith stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most on a time go but month of trying i just cant say good about this record accept for maybe clip in song or two is because these song are all over the place they just stay any very long doe every song also have to have long slow only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca the conductor is riccardo chailly and the is symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding in da lied vocal are not prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are prominent it therefore the case that in other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a role in any recording it damage the recording and ha to cause the to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins grindcore such exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the recording and the distorted voice enhances pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender to realize that mahler music is some type of novelty song a the case with i put a spell on for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to the other piece on this disc set composition on the are by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three the thirteen of the of knaben wunderhorn are on compilation this review provides a side side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton claudio abbado the abbado is slightly better for the reason listed second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn at second and at the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in and here they play a tune just a riff at the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend a lower pitch the previously motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there not any crash of cymbal timing are for the rattle this and other part klagende lied essentially the same for chailly recording and the rattle recording with the nit exception that i list below the chailly of waldmarchen begin a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make entrance at min sec one of most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make entrance at min second robert voice somewhat creamy sounding like that of thomas quasthoff thus have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording ha a tenor a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening of the chailly and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the drum a strong line provided by tuba and stringed bass and brass this third movement da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence an off band which is much quieter than the stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music vocal soloist at least this of time this movement feature chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference the rattle recording of da klagende the rattle recording wa recorded a higher and the and cymbal are more crisp dramatic in the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording that by thomas quasthoff baritone anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording are only three song a i above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a vibrato in the abbado some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of song da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and like this one the best because it is the same a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway compare the de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that at second and again at second the piece concludes with low volume mysterious sounding gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection mahler piece are numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of piece on the chailly with recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording did my own side by side comparison discovered i had a preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa when mahler wa only twenty year
1	thank you so much it fantastic i truly appreciate it very very peaceful it peaceable amazing the way clear it make you feel
1	i bought this cd composer some year ago and ludwig van beethoven i wa most interested in a shipway recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work thomas more is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style poached and summertime drama and very lyrically past what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle medicine with lesser lumbering known or assign le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony totally are in buy some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened mod to the th yesterday vegetable when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame fiddle of mind we hertz all need music like this sometimes ive symphony orchestra needed it a lot lately sir roger sole norringtons recording of the symphony of rattling schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i miracle find it hard to listen play to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra medicine any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make finish this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic elated vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their greater london table

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these tenacious past the disco day of the mid to recent s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and give way to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released some other song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the cut through sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and mayhap it got used that elbow room at some peak it really a fairly cute little subservient and it pitiful that it seems to have been solely forgotten in the history of that earned run average of music i hear there really wa a dance called the shuffle that come with this song but i dont have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps youll clue u in

0	i to this wanting to like it i been a fan of pink floyd forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my with this album and be honest of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi can just continue spitting out this i hate this hate that and so should you drivel and keep raking in the cash i not a dyed in the wool trump fan anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid it then i bought it again thinking maybe wa too on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself who need that if i want be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is that bad and there is hope for the human i prefer to think of roger water moment to the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy line fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some somewhat deep concept and putting word and music to them that run perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good human being cry it a song written from the perspective of good shepherd to his friend lazarus and is a knock down hymn about the victory of good shepherd over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong daughter and presume i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im grateful that a gifted songster and player like saint peter the apostle furler is tranquil putting out tone music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian receiving set

1	you have to recommend though that music in this a sort of play itself extreme organist far a kind concerned the a must just not get of the way of it a kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound can the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and are job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i consider the texture dynamic nicely with mixture in reed in car within a modest forte because there thats no and of dynamic i think this performance would be im good choice for listening to and walter keeping where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment for do compression which is to listening the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or reduce in beautifully so the thickening range is not really a this consideration bear still mind that major recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up car i hear it and the entire set

0	this recording by senegalese singer light headed laba sosseh elision released on roberto torress sar light headed label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the information technology cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception vapid of the three song i non already mentioned this recording wa of group a join course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the ground african market by hefty putting preserve a famous african singer on the front operating room cost cover and by tune up including some exclusively african tune the problem consider stimulate here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that cost the three african meddling song singed in african dialect and in meddling french group a past are totally uneventful bland fiddle uninspiring call linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless evening there is nothing group a happening terpsichore laba sosseh is brawny often too busy only chit chatting rubbish instead of unaccompanied matter singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my referee nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo altogether it applesauce feature laba sosseh telling u centre in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african hind end style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a group a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah past de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end curium other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and clear dance to the coconut whatever that mean and terpsichore to come and drink soft fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the huntsman horn phone speaking to the people of get one half niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too stimulate while latin music ha often cornet being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this thomas more is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the exemplar end which isnt helped by splendid the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the bump reason why i decided to review this recording mean value now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th fresh record album of perhaps august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice attendant pelta fare written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change significance your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by organization information technology african associate a pianist alfredo valds information technology jr explained on his fascinating interview the son decorous of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think repute that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the around point is not to discredit african music stimulate by any mean because it not one half what i want to do and i do chromium not have the competence knowledge to do jerked meat it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling piddling example of what african well nigh music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it rattling medicine the right way a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune brilliant and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with

0	this read by senegalese singer laba sosseh issue on roberto torress sar label is for me matchless of the worst newfangled house of york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheap lightheaded and corny the label ha to proffer in newfangled house of york with the elision of the three sung i already mentioned this read wa of course an obvious purport in trying to aim even more at the african market by order a famous african singer on the front cover and by admit some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally comprehend is that the three african sung singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotone and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is much too busy chit chatting wish wash instead of singing decent or ad lib and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a lilliputian electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which sire on my nerve the st birdsong doesnt even proffer a matchless refrain or a matchless musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual phantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further birdsong feature a refrain a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah all the way through till the close other than that we sire laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao pearl coast and sngal to ejaculate and dance to the coconut whatever that substance and to ejaculate and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone utter to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin euphony ha much being accused of using bland lyric poem that totally lack of profoundness this is really a uncollectible a it stimulate for birdsong i have nothing else to say other than a hooter solo by alfredo armenteros umber towards the close which isnt help oneself by the background musicalness but which still come out pretty well come in from him the reason why i decide to review this read now that it ha been uncommitted under military policeman downloads since the th of august is to recite you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta compose by miguel matamros and maybe birdsong anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on military policeman downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explicate on his enthralling interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal file away section i still remember that they should have ejaculate up with a much better african euphony project that showcase the euphony decent or with a greco roman cuban style of read that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african euphony by any substance because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the sung in this record album are appalling example of what african euphony should be last there would have been matchless more laba sosseh read on sar in and while i havent heard it decent i can still recite that it a better record album than this matchless there definitely a slight extra stake inside the tune and although there isnt matchless track that stimulate approach maracaibo oriental boiler suit the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul cakehole sway solid cuban tune

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rocknroll stria in detail i am not ane of those people for me this musical style is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a dainty helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice up of it on this album numb the same see red the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this musical style want to produce something of more universal solicitation and implication tac ha stated it a shot of our generation right now the agency a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and erotic love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call lifespan today i have felt this agency but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric speculate this country of affair and musically they take in on various body of work the main unity i notice are linkin parkland hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and societal the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer smell and tell me what you realise track tell u why continues with the directly political we are tube before you say so long youve fuck off to tell u why thing flummox more personal in turn me on which appear to be about people questioning unity road to ego satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the pain is over failed human relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i flummox the chance to recreate i think youll lack me to stay beautiful ha a lyric poem that ha sure a shooting entered my promontory many time youre beautiful so ban beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nada here are broadly about the difficulty of go a lifespan of your select in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for melodious body of work there are element other than the unity i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track receptive with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should have a bun in the oven something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say niner edge nail gave em a argue give with dance music element then let in some excellent guitar body of work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is enraptured spiritual up and grunge is depressing scarey down several track have a synth string background knowledge that give them a more mainstream sound just another let in military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you realise with an ironic twist they sing receptive up your eye nada more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not ban numb smell around nada ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could near be an s pop rocknroll track and acceptance is depicted in this melodious setting hmmmm the album is full of the moon of explicit lyric poem which i had to censor in this reappraisal so if you are ane of those people who cant take that by all entail stay away but if you are ok with free manifestation you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off second track describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest album to emerge post they decided to incorporate more heavy unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along vice grip the first single also follows in this then like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete with mccall a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal a drum pattern from queen we will rock you with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch from traditional sound i would only recommend this pd completionists and masochist

1	love this song redolent of grover washington jr great style and warmth
1	and have to made though that music of this fugue sort of play itself and transparency far a im because the organist must just not get in the way of a walter kraft ha far a extreme that is mostly flute sound or the first part of a kind which allows in a for dynamic counterpoint to be clearly heard you thats job number one a chosen a this a is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening this with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest bear concerned there are no registration of dynamic i think this performance would be listener compression choice mind listening to enough it car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do good which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane for listening in car so the the range is not really the major consideration forte in for that nicely recording wa consider in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest corniest the label to in york with the exception of the three song already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent trying to even more at the african market putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that personally perceived is that the three african singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the which get on my nerve doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it laba sosseh telling in the middle of a fantasy that ngombelle a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a a and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and come dance to that mean and to come and drink fresh juice with him on the beach he even make the impression the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland that totally lack of depth this really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards end isnt by the background musicality but which still come out pretty coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you download the great maracaibo oriental the written by miguel matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na change your but which is decent enough to be skipped or bought just on mp downloads even label wa mainly run by african associate pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of vista in descargas journal archive section i still that they should come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it i can still tell that it better album this there definitely slight extra interest within the tune and although isnt track that get maracaibo oriental overall album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock which also happen to be song and another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a hook product link linked class a link href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw ie utf sosseh a song maracaibo literally a brilliant montno descrga it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by valds jr that work to with this amazing tune the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by torres and amazing trombone horn arrangement powerful and solid trombone by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk the tune is very pleasant laid back with a set of horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino some fine trumpet by chocolate towards end the fine keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl my dad bought by mistake ago which i happily transferred onto a cd through a just for those song my friend didnt with me either and said that the other song on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting
1	tragically it ha pump been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the chase after world the well nigh sanctify great natalie cole but if there is one thing that endearing sanctify i have adored about natalie is that she borecole had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart turn something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from leave out the absolute bear voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career practically borecole and her life in eld the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music medicine after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone self asserting a life sentence smile like church father yours is one of bel those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song class from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love lapplander i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere bel only voice with a deep cost heart natalie cole song b

1	this merchandise take the mannequin of ii squeeze disc on the decca judge the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning affect fassbaender in da klangende rest the vocal are not a large a the orchestral voice but in all the other tack in the ii disc the vocal are more large it is therefore the guinea pig that in these other tack the part of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer get word most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this outlandish exaggerated vibrato suit fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders part ha a large purpose in any memorialize it redress the memorialize and ha the potential to cause the hearer to be get at irritated and wild in some kind of medicine such a i put a tour on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such a disinter to consume a recorded by the grindcore circle carcase the distorted part is the point of the memorialize and the distorted part enhance the pleasure of the heed have but fassbaender go wrong to realize that mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender go wrong to realize that mahler medicine is not some type of novelty song a is the guinea pig with i put a tour on you for this ground i recommend only da klagende rest but am not able to recommend the other tack on this magnetic disc sic the opus on the magnetic disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende rest kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all tetrad song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all fivesome song are here only leash of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review furnish a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same memorialize under the baton of neil simon rale the rale memorialize is slenderly break for conclude expose below this review also furnish a side by side comparison of unity of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the memorialize by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado memorialize is slenderly break for the conclude heel below mo by mo account of waldmarchen this furnish a description of the open up moment of da klagende rest unity of my very favourite tack from the hellenic repertoire waldmarchen lead off with muffled kettle grind away at the mo point the french people tusk provide a short riff then at second the transverse flute connect in the french people tusk curriculum vitae at second and at second the beating reed instrument and string connect the fray at second the french people tusk connect in again and here they recreate a veridical tune not just a riff at second the strain render by the entire orchestra descend to a humiliated pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the humiliated pitch at unity infinitesimal and second ejaculate a fleeting crescendo it is a self aggrandising crescendo but there is not any break up of cymbal these time are for the rale memorialize this and other voice of da klagende rest are basically the same for the chailly memorialize and for the rale memorialize with the nit picky elision that i name below the chailly memorialize of waldmarchen lead off with a scope noise harkat ul mujahidin that last for a mo but the rale memorialize come out with medicine not with any harkat ul mujahidin compare waldmarchen memorialize under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is min and second while the rale timing is min and second in the chailly memorialize the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing unity of the most beautiful strain in the hellenic repertoire mr hollwegs part is slenderly chintzy in the rale memorialize the tenor henry m robert bout make his entrance at min second henry m robert tear part is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat the like that of thomas quasthoff frankincense i have a very flimsy penchant for the rale memorialize for conclude obscure to me the chailly memorialize ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rale memorialize ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry m robert bout and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernible conflict to my ear in the open up min of the chailly and rale memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialize clock at while the rale memorialize is the open up infinitesimal is describe by alone flourish from the kettle grind away a strong bass agate line render by tuba and stringed bass and blaring memorial tablet this third movement of da klagende rest is describe by the presence of an off microscope stage circle which is much smooth than the on microscope stage orchestra the off microscope stage circle can be heard for representative in the time interval of to when the off microscope stage circle is represent the only other reference of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this time interval of fourth dimension this movement also characteristic a chorus predilection for the surveil conclude i have a flimsy penchant for the rale memorialize of da klagende rest the rale memorialize wa recorded at a high pitched intensity and the memorial tablet and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly memorialize could be characterized a very slenderly muddy also i have a flimsy penchant for henry m robert tear part over the chintzy part of hollweg the surveil equivalence da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialize with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly memorialize there are only leash song a i remark above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado memorialize some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female person my favourite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i the like this unity the adept because it is the same melody a that observe in the waltz around movement in mahler symphony orchestra no anyway this equivalence the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notability characteristic of the abbado memorialize are the fluttery champagne flute motif take place at second and second and the fivesome mo domestic as the like comminute from clarinet that pas at second and again at second the slice concludes with a low intensity mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado memorialize over the chailly memorialize for many conclude starting time of all the chailly memorialize of the fish song ha too much recall also in the chailly memorialize the fluttery champagne flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her part flutter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as sound is not much noticeable in the chailly memorialize also the very end of the slice in the chailly memorialize characteristic a large low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not fall out at the end of the chailly memorialize to ingeminate these point what i the like and prefer about the abbado memorialize is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery transverse flute domestic as comminute and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly memorialize furnish a corking selection of mahler tack that are not numbered symphony a heedful side by side comparison of any of the tack on the chailly memorialize with other memorialize will enable any hearer to decide on a best loved memorialize i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a flimsy penchant for memorialize under the baton of neil simon rale and claudio abbado da klagende rest is my very favourite of mahler opus and it ha been my favourite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty geezerhood erstwhile

1	i know that some people can discus at distance the merit of versatile rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side cup of tea not the primary course but i can value a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this record album numb the same see red the same desperation the same hard butt but i think that frontmen tac and hasheesh while working from this genre treasured to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha say it a snapshot of our generation in good order now the way a lot of atomic number feel in a time of war technology pain sensation and get laid it tardily to feel dissociated and numb to all the bedlam we call aliveness today i have matt up this way but i havent pronounce it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of social occasion and musically they disembowel on versatile influence the primary one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover charge the whole range of problem political personal and social the title of respect track acquaint the hopelessness which pervades the record album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and say me what you take care track say atomic number why go forward with the directly political we are underground before you say so long youve got to say atomic number why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over give out relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll wish me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many fourth dimension youre beautiful so censor beautiful gem state be a slight more complete if i just had you just another never that former armed force away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a aliveness of your choosing in a companionship that is tense up demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodious solemn forte piano which say you that you should expect something wickedness and grave i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch sail through gave pica a reasonableness open with terpsichore medicine element then includes some excellent guitar work both grubby and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic religious up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string backdrop that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes war machine flair drumming and u s army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you take care with an ironic winding they blab open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go bad away and im not censor numb look round nothing always heals the pain sensation the irony lie in the fact that the medicine for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the record album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this survey so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all way stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an record album that is a fresh take on something that ha been round for a while

0	it quite funny how the start lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to integrated more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in cartroad that i would never expect from this band ruiner already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big tawdry and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over blab along chorus vice grapple the start bingle too succeed in this vena then we have cartroad like crushed which start bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the simple machine knockoff writing on the wall is a fill in joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst rag vocal over a drum radiation diagram move up from queen we will careen you fill in with dubbed in violin whilst most of these cartroad are overproduced second rater i actually like the track dedicate a it experience like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a fill in loss of an record album but it is a painful presentation of second rater from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	have to consider though that music of this kind of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of walter kraft ha a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint be clearly heard and thats job number a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are extreme of dynamic i think this performance would a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening earphone plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made the seventy it hold up i recommend it and the entire set

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap naught rock band in associate in nursing detail i am not one of those order contingent people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac contribute and hash while working from hera this genre wanted to around create something of more universal appeal indiana and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right know now the way a only lot of u feel in belowground a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all record album the chaos we call life today i have felt denotative this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i for certain notice are linkin park hollywood clear undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the scary title only track present the apart hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now peg ironical cost take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the contribute directly political we are underground before you detectable say goodbye youve some other got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn ended me on which seems to be about people questioning cost one route to self satisfaction in group a my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so wax censored beautiful id be a little more complete bear if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here ban are pine tree state generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and loosely hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the au revoir one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which only tell you that you should expect something dark and musical comedy serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance see to it music element then includes some excellent well nigh guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic loosely is ecstatic like a shot indiana spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream consider aside sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with perceptible an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now personal matter the time ha come and all this go away wax and im not censored numb look around naught nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the shuddery fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and indiana acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to quell censor toll in this review so if you are one of see to it those people who cant take doorknocker that by all mean cant over stay away but if you are ok with free get expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take blab out on something that ha been around for a while

0	more music the npr here and on comment to lead me to it great disk this wa very difficult to play my copy like most people i have great then one device helped play a cd in this cd doe not work in most of them
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	despite this being a label immature album it really just another flame album v rose only get one track to herself and it the arsenic forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young glut originative noah due to refulgency creative fire effulgence difference the label ha aside stuck with their two artist yes smell a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without question and non it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed a the guest did not tell shine particularly bright either indiana so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album arsenic wa that good overall
1	you have to consider though that euphony of this genial sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the path of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first voice of the psychogenic fugue which allows enough transparentness for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number unmatchable a far a this auditor is concerned towards the end i hear the texture inspissate nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremum of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listen to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do concretion which is to reduce the extremum of volume for listen through earphone in plane or listen in automobile so the dynamic range is not really a major thoughtfulness bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i commend it and the entire set
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify benatar of for those who and album i it indie is great rock i dont know but what i go know is that this work go me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to purposefully from album drawing from old of music from when i wa album teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded a of missing person and the driving vocal the pat fireflights and pop musicality of the website smackerl mixed with a heaping smackerl school inxs thanks pooh silly the it word do you for ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully and and combined to create something fresh wait dare anointed viewing i check out the band ha they have their video available for your say pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song is assure you

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix carrier of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler pine tree state and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly cost together the highlight of the admirer album for me medicine is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have along a the right way good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory pine tree state of cost jesus over death a few other highlight for cost me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and through and through cost im thankful that a talented songwriter and former musician like peter furler is still putting out foreground quality music it a great convey reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic along supporter fluff on christian radio
0	very old but wa looking for the song for a frend
0	not to much into the hard rock sound
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to music what be to or fast depends on can you like to listen slow
1	i lost this song from my mp album i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago
1	this a great sounding set which is very to listen to i recomend it highly i not recomend the second more piano masterpiece
1	tragically it ha been one year since the one of the most sincerest diva of the the great natalie cole but if there one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice her heart something many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have been able to show at all instead they made song that are cheaper than soulful from absolute voice natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her father nat king cole and went into jazz music after r b she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one song that is worth listening to from beginning to end flexed her and beautiful voice in movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best her lifetime it rank just high a song like miss you like crazy and love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere with deep heart natalie cole song
0	i dont like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i dont like any of them so i wont spend the money to buy the entire album when this song is available to download individually let me know and you just might get a sale
1	this product take this form of two compact disc on the decca sounding the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester chailly the singer from brigitte opening warning regarding fassbaender in from klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more is it is is in case that in these other song the voice ha brigitte fassbaender therefore what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to the it voice includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this under exaggerated vibrato cause abbado singing to be grossly in to be a perversion and to be an insult carcass the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders a ha a klagende role hollweg any this it damage the recording and point the piece to cause the listener a be annoyed irritated and angry in presented kind of music such a i put a spell the you a set by screaming voice hawkins or in grindcore music such and exhume to consume a singing by the grindcore band to the distorted and is the point a they recording and the hollweg jay enhances the pleasure of there listening be but muffled by to realize that mahler music is not grindcore prefer also fassbaender fails by realize that mahler music is not on the of novelty song a is the solo with i put a spell on you for the like prominent recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc recorded the composition of the disc are all in gustav recording and they consist occurring da klagende lied stage de knaben comparison lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are year only three on quieter thirteen is the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review the a side by side comparison of de a wunderhorn with the brigitte recording bizarre the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly line for reason disclosed below this just also provides a side by side slightly the one this of piece from da are wunderhorn the song braying the fish with chailly recording by thomas qusthoff cymbal provides beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better point the reason listed below make by second account of waldmarchen this provides a tear of the opening moment chailly da klagende some one of of very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with fassbaender kettle drum at the second for the french horn provide a short riff then at is the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in very and here the play knaben real of not review a riff because the the melody repertoire by the entire orchestra of to a lower pitch and the previously some motif are band by at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a a crescendo it is voice big crescendo but there of not any crash of cymbal these rattle are for the careful recording this and at part of da klagende lied da tenor the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with in not the any hum comparing donkey recording under the is chailly chailly and timing the chailly timing is minute and bass the on rattle timing baton minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance type min sec singing and the the most beautiful melody distorted the classical provided mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the essentially robert tear make his the at min second robert tear voice is tuba second sounding the like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for slight unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner flute and to bass andreas schmidt while music contrast a rattle recording of to tenor and from baritone of tenor second robert tear that call baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied my der speilmann the is no discernable difference to my ear in stage lied minute of the chailly one rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording the the fassbaender minute is distinguished by case flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass better provided by somewhat and stringed second label blaring orchestra this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence descend contrast off recording band which is much the than the on stage brass the off the band can experience heard obscured example in the interval of to when somewhat off kindertotenlieder reiterated is playing the flutter other source tune music is vocal soloist at least for recording interval of time of movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the not recording of da i lied the rattle recording wa recorded at at higher volume and the brass and and are more crisp and dramatic the an second chailly recording could be characterized a very comparison muddy also i have a reason preference for robert description voice over the tinny voice of in the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that but thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano twenty chailly by abbado on the deutche grammophon label some the chailly recording there are recording three song a i mentioned above and these knaben sung by same fassbaender recording us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado stage opening of the song are sung to the male while others fails the female my favorite abbado all my the song da are knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this entrance the best at it is the same melody a that found by the waltz movement in the symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from other chailly and my recording notable feature of the fassbaenders mahler are the fluttery flute motif of at second and creamy and the five second donkey reason braying is clarinet simon occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a distorted volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the is who for many reason first of all the of recording of the fish song ha too much echo also it pitch chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are for because brigitte fassbaender sings a while same with a the flute and because mahler fassbaender second her voice flitter and only with her of the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the berlin recording also the very end of the piece in the of recording feature of prominent low note the a bassoon and momentary my ear the mysterious and chinese gong doe not a at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these ha what i like and music about one abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery low waldmarchen about recorded mysterious chinese gong conclusion mahler conducted recording provides occur great selection of brigitte piece a are rattle numbered symphony a rattle side by side wunderhorn of any vibrato the potential on the chailly recording with other only will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of that rattle and claudio of da klagende lied is prominent again favorite of mahler composition and it ha been abbado favorite since the year in wa composed when mahler wa only a here old

0	this recording senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is me one the worst new york sar recording that you can and definitely the silliest and corniest the label ha in new york with the exception of the song i mentioned this recording wa course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the market by putting a african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach with a little electric guitar and trap in the background which get my nerve the st song doesnt offer a single chorus or single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah the way through till the end other than that get sosseh the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make impression he on the phone speaking to the of in niger to invite them for a fresh juice too while latin music ha often of using bland lyric that totally lack depth this is really a bad a it get for i have else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo chocolate the end which helped by the background musicality but which come pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by and maybe song anichayi which aint change your world which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly by african associate a pianist valds jr on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project showcase music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would to their thing therefore the point is to discredit african music by any mean it not what i want to do and i do not have competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that of the song this album appalling of what african music should be finally there would have been one more sosseh recording on sar in and while i heard properly can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song i dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway a data hook product link linked class a link normal href sosseh dp b esgx w ref cr arp d txt ie laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some trumpet playing towards the end chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to on tune and everyone is at home and in their own here descrga latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having himself the reputation of being a otherwise the tune is pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end fine chorus singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a great song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad by mistake age ago and which i transferred onto a cd through friend just for those song my friend didnt with me and said that the other song went on for too long and were unexciting too

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is side dish the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when hear it band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb same same desperation the same hard but think that tac and hash working from genre to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha a snapshot of our generation now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to is now gone now take a closer look and tell what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to people questioning route to self my song and thing you think i say the anguish is failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha lyric ha certainly entered head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty living a life of your in a society that is tense demanding and for musical influence there are element other than one i above are noticeable of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect dark and be and other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a string that give a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and in musical setting hmmmm the album is full of language which i had to censor in this review so you are one of those who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to but me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here with arrangement that are sort of all of piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be i even give it enough airplay to find if it deeper a contrast just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered of this original and which caught me fully first time you cant go wrong with carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together collection

1	i know that some people can talk over at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not nonpareil of those people for me this genre is a position cup of tea not the independent course but i can appreciate a squeamish serving when i listen it new band abica dish up a good slice of it on this album numb the same ira the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and haschisch while wreak from this genre desire to make something of more universal appeal and implication tac ha stated it a snapshot of our multiplication right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology nuisance and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life nowadays i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the independent one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track submit the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now look at a unaired look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which look to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my strain and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the quest ha the logical argument just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyrical that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful gem state be a little more all over if i just had you just another neer that far outside and nothing here are loosely about the trouble of living a life of your pick out in a high society that is tense exact and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with musical grave softly which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say club inch nail ease up em a reason open with dance music element then includes some fantabulous guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is rapt ghostlike up and grunge is depressing shivery down respective track have a synth draw background that chip in them a more mainstream sound just another includes war machine style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic curve they sing open up your eye nothing more to cover now the time ha come and all this go outside and im not censored numb look around nothing eer heals the nuisance the irony lie in in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is pictured in this musical lay out hmmmm the album is full of the moon of explicit linguistic process which i had to censor in this review so if you are nonpareil of those people who cant look at that by all mean stay outside but if you are alright with liberal reflection you will listen an album that is a impudent look at on something that ha been around for a while

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	really misleading it more of a minute show than a full length one of behind the scene talk but thats about it
1	you have to consider though that euphony of this kind sort of represent itself and a far a im concerned the organist mustiness just not get in the way of it bruno walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is by and large champagne flute fathom for the first division of the fugue which grant enough transparency for the contrast to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still guardianship within a mild forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good option for listening to in a machine where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in airplane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not genuinely a major consideration bear in mind that this show wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	it quite funny remark how the first lyric to start off the second gear track here describe this perfectly after four spot of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy alloy influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a spare mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would neer expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it speech rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb fathom youd expect to satiate an arena turgid drum fill and roar guitar over sing along chorus vice grasp the first i also follow in this vein then we have track like demolish which first bite off shangri la shall burn down then sound like theyre seek to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with nickname in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced averageness i actually like the track dedicated a it find like the least of a departure from their old fathom and the fathom of fury is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of averageness from a band seek to branch out from their traditional fathom i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to commence off the second track here key this absolutely after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous messiness of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band guided missile destroyer already get going this off on an flukey notation with it rhythm section live for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drumfish satisfy and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice traveling bag the first single also follows in this vein then we have track corresponding crushed which first bite off nirvana shall burn then sound corresponding theyre attempting to be some rd order rage against the motorcar knockoff writing on the surround is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drumfish pattern lifted from nance we will rock you complete with dubbed in fiddle whilst most of these track are overproduce second rater i actually corresponding the track dedicated a it feel corresponding the least of a departure from their honest to goodness sound and the sound of violence is jolly cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful show of second rater from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i very bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something disappointed with something unfortunately this is latter ive always considered tech n to of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical inspired of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though album ha had a different feel to it ive always been to find a measure of creativity and his sound this album is slowwwwwed down show off the rapid flow that ha always been a staple of his music everything ha to mile per hour of awesomeness but have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the reason i am this a of a dont wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down for the last two there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half album song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good system not the reason i tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha his tune to keep up with current time he ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well will definitely take long listen to the next tech n ne album before in foot first with purchase again

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	actually it didnt the inaugural tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt relaxing at all if anything the cricket noise would keep open one awake and i just found it too irritative
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo druthers chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin group a the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in commemorate all the other piece s in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the too case that in these other piece the voice of associate in nursing brigitte fassbaender is indiana what the along listener time hears vocal music most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly designate rattling distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the clock listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of in any case music such a i put a spell on you a in any case recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the lineament point past of the recording and the distorted billy club voice champagne flute enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but qualify fassbaender fails to realize that mahler commemorate music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize group a that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put along a spell on you for rattling this reason i recommend only da klagende lied whatever but am not auditor able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de provide knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and set finish ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides in that location a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this norman thomas review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the call song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about only the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the group a beliner philharmoniker non under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the record opening moment skillful of da klagende lied commemorate one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin capital with muffled kettle drum call at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french astatine cymbal horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and dingy here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra former descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at totally paul simon the lower pitch at one minute deign and second come a momentary clock crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not merchandise any provide crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for group a the classic chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise cost hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording commemorate under the baton of chailly and cosmic string clock rattle the chailly opening move timing commemorate is minute and second while tierce the rattle timing is minute and second in information technology the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance cram at min sec singing one tam tam of the most beautiful druthers melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat time interval creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas vocalisation quasthoff thus i have a very cheesy slight preference for the rattle recording for reason fiddle unknown to retell me the chailly turn commemorate recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha stimulate a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone fructify is sean rea the group a next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no cost discernable difference comparable cost to my ear in the opening minute of the set up chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute henry m robert is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a overdone strong bass line provided group a by tuba and stringed bass and auditor blaring brass this third movement modify of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of toll an off stage repertory band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for rattling example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only champagne flute other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i cost have a slight preference for the rattle recording side by side of da klagende recording lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in totally contrast the chailly patch recording could group a be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear refrain voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the car horn deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song totally a i group a mind mentioned above and these are sung cheesy by brigitte fassbaender who cost us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung compare by the cost male while others auditor by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben group a wunderhorn is the song about disc pas off the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a get that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von patch padua fishpredight nobelium from the billy club chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are cost the henry m robert fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that rattling occurs at second and again at second non get the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious past sounding chinese gong elision i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of at the fish song group a ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte around auditor fassbaender mystical sings at the same pitch a the flute and because try brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey second gear sound break up is not much noticeable commemorate in the chailly recording also the lie in very end of the piece in the chailly non recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon information technology and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese s gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered commemorate symphony a too careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight rattling preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle astatine and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa terminate only twenty year old

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something ala this is the latter ive always considered technical school n ne to be one of live on great citadel of hip hop euphony in this bleak conservative egotistic club inspired earned run average of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a dissimilar feel to it ive always been able bodied to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down technical school rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his euphony not everything ha to be nautical mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like technical school sat around eating analgesic all day before recording either the dj wa altogether uninspired i am used to tech setting commix to be a strong point of this artist ordinarily a complex mixed bag of great face synthesizer dissimilar time signature other genre of euphony thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest try around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any concomitant euphony the lyric are amazing a usual you can order he poured alot of himself into this album the only ground i am giving this a or else of a dont get me wrong there are just track on this standard candle most of the wrath start out of the standard candle is pretty just then slows down horrifically for the live on two part there are only a few memorable track on the full second half of album the song beat sound cut and paste from late technical school n ne cd sound like technical school wa trying to name a bass standard candle to come out in your car if you have a just sound system not the ground i buy technical school n ne if i wanted to thump my body i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to name up most of the market today like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha interchange his line to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the position quo i am sure it will sell intimately i will definitely take a long mind to the next technical school n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	know that some people discus at length of rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but think that frontmen tac while working from this genre wanted to create something of universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it to dissociated and all chaos we call life today i have felt this but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state affair and musically they on the main i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range political personal and social the title track present the which pervades album if everything that mattered to me is now gone take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got tell u thing get more in me on which seems to be people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit the line just let me in i get the chance to play i youll want me stay ha lyric that certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a more complete if i just had you just never that far and nothing here are about the difficulty of living life of your in a society that is tense demanding a musical influence are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that expect dark and serious i can be real and some track have an industrial reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open dance music element then includes guitar work both grungy and a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary several track a synth string background that them a more just another includes style and army march lingo release from numbness come in final track what see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now time ha and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is of explicit language which i had censor in review so if you are one those people who cant take that by all stay away but if ok with free expression will hear an album is a fresh take on something that ha been around for

0	music recording by senegalese singer there sosseh released better roberto sar sar label is for me one a brilliant amazing new to sar recording that the can torres and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the putting of the three in i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying skipped aim that more at you african market by exception of famous african singer keep the front cover and by including some exclusively african would chocolate problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally the is that the three african song singed happen african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally from there is nothing still laba sosseh is often too busy back chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some were of lyric laid back tropical beach feel a juice although electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song ie even offer a single great or a single since solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of work sexual fantasy that ngombelle fine a traditional african musician of dance that other country in anichayi also love to dance have and encourages them and not whatever even further song feature a chorus a the a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way tras till the end other than that we get laba sosseh martinique the people pattern inviting curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut it one mean and to come the drink by coconut a with him on the beach the even make knowledge with he on the phone speaking to his people of niamey in and to to them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being solo of descrga bland slightly that totally lack of depth this is really a bad to ago get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by end armenteros chocolate towards the to which isnt helped is the background nbsp but which still come out pretty well coming from him the and why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads style the th of august is to tell you to it the chorus maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros descrga maybe song africa which aint gon na change your niger but which is african enough not to be to or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly happily by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on the fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i on think even is should have come up with a much on decent this project that find the music alfredo or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the fresh and the musician speciality i laid say each york their own properly therefore the point is not properly discredit african music by appalling mean because it santiago what i want to do reason i do not have the competence the to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of and song in sosseh album are any made of what african music should in finally there tune to been one more i sosseh recording on torress in and while i havent heard it thing laba can still tell that it a better a than this matamros there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and a there isnt one apparently that anyway near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also example invite be song song and track another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check laba out get musicality normal data hook product link linked class a link with href laba this dp b esgx this ref cm cr arp d rvw txt doesnt utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental they literally a the montno and tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno of chorus alfredo valds at that a to perfection with w amazing tune till the end download also a superb introductory trumpet that by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto showcase and adalberto not worst trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo everyone of pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the perfection by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to end on this tune a by is really jr home and in their own thing here using in latin music term decent jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto one is an old humorous tune about somebody having song himself he reputation of being a jerk otherwise long tune is very pleasant fairly would chit with a set and solid horn arrangement album tres guitar solo be the middle by victor through el chino and some fine trumpet playing mean the towards the end perceived by by on singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for and which is a label enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality happening this reissue seems absolutely fine but dance better than the accused pointless the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age it and which i run transferred onto a cd through little friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree impression me either world said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody leopoldo kind unexciting too

0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and play guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to the light very early version of one of a kind armored defense your love look to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this dont know what track are from this and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff couldnt find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory voyager so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here so overall this sound like s t but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up tony shred
0	the song is fine but i absolutely hate the fact that they verbalize in the intro same we are interested in hearing them take a half hearted attempt at being funny
1	have of their cd and lie with all three lie with how they bring some old song back to new life supreme being is great
0	not such a great cd survival of the fittest only one selection meet my expectation
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for not much to say about a music mp
1	do you is probably one and only of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing however intense at the same time the form up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this bit i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful elegant voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to depict the big businessman of her talent

1	this record album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so lot through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and scriptural truth furler and his conscientious objector writer have a way of demand some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the high spot of the record album for me is it fine for lazarus i heard the song for the for the first time time when i wa running and closely had to stop and have a skilful man cry it a song written from the perspective of saviour to his ally lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of saviour over death a few other high spot for me include shame right on faulty girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this show and im thankful that a gifted songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	i know that some people can discus at length the arsenic merit mold of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish go along not the main course but doubting i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same descent desperation the same hard down pat edge but i think that frontmen tac higher up and hash while working from this smell genre flair wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way nous a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it consider easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call peg life today apprize i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair aside and musically they call draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead discus and of course eminem the cost lyric cover the whole range collection thomas more of problem political personal and social the title glucinium track present the hopelessness group a which pervades the album if dish aerial everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a quell closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get finger more personal in turn me meter on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say former the applied science anguish is over failed relationship the chase after pursuit ha the line just sway let record album me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your gratification choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable beryllium three of the track open gift with melodic solemn piano which course of study spin tell you that you should hera expect something dark upwardly beryllium and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial set sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent cost guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have sound out a synth string careen background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march contribute lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye cost nothing more around to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the stimulate pain the irony lie in apprise the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be past an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted like a shot in this musical setting hmmmm the like a shot album is upwardly full of see to it explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those contribute people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something information technology the right way that ha been around for a while

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to volunteer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that look to be what she kick the bucket with here on with arrangement that are sort of all of a art object and all at one song level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and profundity even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like mean solar day in the life history ditty to be honest i couldnt even yield it enough airplay to obtain if it kick the bucket deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you bevel go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed break advice than she arrive in putting unitedly this collection

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a swan far non a extreme point im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute consider sound for the first part book of job of the fugue which allows extremum enough transparency for cost the counterpoint to loudness be clearly heard kind and thats job number arsenic one a far a this listener indiana is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed auditor still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme indiana of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for come to listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for long suit listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt mr full grown pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he saliva he is so emotional it must be from the bottom of his center

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition yield a little crossway tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the jolly mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the yield producer invariably for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but comrade big edie mum doe not cost seem to take part at all the appeal monotony of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not manufacturer stimulate at all and deficiency wa frankly a little astatine convey humdrum
0	the song is fine but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro like we are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny

0	i went through day of singing this over and over
1	great music from a great series
1	the star say it all , do not know what else i could put other than i love it .
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening 1. i used this product for about two year , at least 5 day a week , and completed the full 1 hour session each time . i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever . i gave it my best shot , i thought if i kept at it , one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me . but no , nothing , nothing good happened , no overwhelm even , just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean .
0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 piece . mine only downloaded 100 .
0	sorry @ the head and the heart but i just do not get it . i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money .
1	awesome song and it is a timeless classic . i dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd . wish i would have listened to it first . not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me . there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to . maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me . it just blew me away right from the start . oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better .
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley , which you do not know unless you are into the whole post-hardcore movement . apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic-sounding song , so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark . the song keep the lyric , maintaining the dirty feeling of it all , but it turn up the rock , and really make it a rockin song , causing it to end up a really weird , but fun combination for various party . check the song out , and you might find you like it if you are into post-hardcore , modern rock , or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat . who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent ? oh , by the way , i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon . ; )
0	did not like this version of his . i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back-up singer . oh well .
1	beautifully written and sung . a song to listen to over and over . sound quality is good especially with headphone , oh yeahhhh .
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world , i do not think that this wa the way to do it , she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter , and should have found a better way to express herself . these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible . i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly , feel a bit embarassed for her too : - (
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and 2001 album - this is not it . i do not feel that this is a dr. dre album since he is not the predominant rapper , but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre . there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one . maybe he should have made detox all along . oh well .
1	very good centering music to maintain balance .
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around the starting line came . they sound exactly like nfg . which is not good either . and there lyric are so boring and lame . if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
1	love this song !
1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it .
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube . loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep . had one of the best sleep in a long time . maybe it wa a one off , but this wa encouraging . time will tell .
1	i did not like it at first . after listening to it a few time , i got it . it is beautiful . lanny is a musical genius .
1	get me pumped for the gym
0	what a rip off of katy perry . wow ! how no one ha noticed is unbelievable !

1	heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song . brought back memory when i wa younger .
0	to small
0	i absolutely love this song ! however , the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible . it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it . it did only cost $ .25 so i guess i will live with it .
1	like steampunk ? well , this is electro-swing - and about half of the electro-swing album i find , i would call steampunk themed music . caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro-swing album that i have found . i highly recomend it . be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that is what i like about it ( it make it a bit more timeless ) . it is fantastic for driving , or background music at party . enjoy !
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode . then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song . i wa sold . that wa when i decided to purchase this song . she reminds me of a japanese shakira . the donde estan los ladrones shakira : soulful , gritty , heart-thread tugging , soul speaking singer .
1	bought this before going to see the show . well done . the show wa awesome ! looking forward to reliving the show with this cd . came with a digital copy via amazon musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise . the cd is new and work great too .
1	always have been a journey fan
0	pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd . forgettable .
0	i do not understand how this album won award . i would ask for my money back if i could .
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie . this album wasnt anything great . i hope the new movie will blow my sock off !
1	another big streisand winner album . great collaboration duo .
1	love bfs ! and they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are . again ! the bitch song ha always been a favorite of mine . and i am so excited to see it back on the track list ! it is great hearing that song . new and musically improved ! : ) stacys mom just make me laugh . because for some weird reason people have thought that they have been singing it for year . and now all of those people are correct haha . and i have never done anything like this is just typical bfs stuff ! love it ! good good stuff ! : )
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i.e . passenger . it is not and wasnt worth keeping . i tossed it in the trash . what a waste of $
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music . most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it . i do .
1	rip
1	yeah buffett .
0	think i deserve my money back . this song wa labeled a clean , yet upon playing the entire song , there are several profane word . wasted my money because i can not listen to it .
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead . even worse , they might mistake it for the original . collection like this need more one-star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
1	this is a good track from my teen year . it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood . i have not heard any of their other music , but this is a good track to get ; )
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week . deftones is one of my favorite band .
1	great album - can not wait to hear more from this group !
0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd . what a waste of money . could these song be sung any slower ? very disapointed . l
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file . i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file/windows medium of my pc . now i can not load the song onto my android phone . i tried over and over again . the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer . will someone call or email me and straighten this out .
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort . i find it boring . i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only 2 or 3 likable song out of 14. that is not what i wanted . i wanted 6-8 track that were very good not just 2-3. of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer . but this difference is sound went the wrong way . everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it . i have listend to this album 6 or 7 time and still am not too thrilled . brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened . i hope the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed .
1	perfect . a described . thank you
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. really take me back to that time , really good song .
1	incredible musical talent and so inspirational ! love love love it !
1	this band is so good ! there last album wa good . this one is even better !
0	bought by mistake . not among kelly best ( check out ne-yos song of the same name ) .
0	what a lazy production from pink floyd a it is supposed last album . very disappointed .
1	great song ! band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well ! recommend to people who like heavy metal , just not cookie monster metal !
1	love this song !
1	my 14 month old baby love this song . quality is great . i wanted exactly same sinsong , singed by same singer etc . and i think this is it !
1	i love this song ! download wa smooth and simple . burn to disc wa fine . will download more music from amazon .
0	great song , but the download version is only 128kbps . why is no higher quality version available ?
0	art garfunkel ? his version wa much better , more relaxed , and much smoother . i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr. grobans range .
0	i would love to give this a great review ( because i have been purchasing mp3 downloads for year from amazon ) . but after all my searching , my hard drive show no sign of this song . wish i could say more . i have tried all of the trouble shooting suggestion made by the account manager . still no luck . so . until i get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads i have ever purchase . i will have to hold off on any positive review .
0	really misleading . it is more of a 10 minute show than a full length one . lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it .
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie , but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother . this audio encounter is not by the mayles , and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party . the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck . the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive . i do not know the timing of this production but big edie ( mum ) doe not seem to take part at all . the appeal of little edie had always been her expression , body language , and refreshing vocal ; this production did not stimulate at all , and wa frankly a little humdrum .
0	every now and then , great artist miss the target . queen had hot space van halen had vh iii this is on that scale of bad . it is sing songy long boring choral moment . it is melodramatic story telling . it is the greatest collection of technically gifted artist playing simple uninteresting part . do you remember asia ? yeah it is that bad .
0	not such a great cd . only one selection meet my expectation .
0	music wa too high i could not use the soundtrack . i tried with my soprano and they could not sing to the soundtrack .
1	love them
0	i downloaded it .
1	stevie is hot , young or older
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer , but to me , songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here , along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level . i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit - that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength . this album is more like day in the life ditty . to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper . a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this ( all original ) and which caught me fully first time through . you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle . crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection .
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy . i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one . sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample . well this wa the only full version of her retail album , so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it . i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored ! this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store . they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is a censored version when they do not offer the real version at all . now i am stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar . i feel intentionally misled .
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor , his voice is a example of perfection . his story make his music even more touching . i hope he get the attention of american . his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart .
1	classic al stuff . in his usual humorous style . early in al album every song is great .
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me . how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric ? better songwriting is definitely in order .
0	the drifter are typical of many group of the era , with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member . lot of lawsuit usually resulted . the nostalgic listener , expecting an authentic trip down memory lane , is the loser . if you are looking for the real thing , you have to go to the source : atlantic record ( < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/only-in-america-atlantic-soul-classics/dp/b00260phvo/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > only in america : atlantic soul classic < /a > ) . this marvelous collection includes the original recording of great drifter song , a well a many other atlantic performer such a ben e. king , don covay , sam & dave and otis redding . it aint cheap , but the real thing seldom is .
0	i have trouble keeping this cd on . the singing is dreadful . her voice is horrible . it sound like she is calling the devil . my kid leave when it is on . i can not recommend this cd , it is just not good .
1	great song better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season 1
0	i think it is so good message is great i just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star .
0	love the band , but there only one good song on this release . seriously , anything that say feat . in it is passe and unoriginal . if you are so good , why do you need help ? it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together , and now everyone is doing it . seriously , keep the dj out . none of the good one know wtf they are doing . i will pas on this one . collide is much better , and 13 song at that .
1	an outstanding collection of song by a group out of vega , they are featured on the soundtrack for resident evil extinction track 15 contagious i have not heard a new band this good in year . hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music , but these guy . these guy changed all that . thank you adam , ricky , kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius , i look forward to more of your stuff ! check them out on their myspace page [ . ] . add them and tell them alex from nc sent you !
0	too sad . must be a liberal
1	one of my favorite dylan album . a masterpiece !
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
0	no rocky top ? ! ? why bother ? that is like warm beer & cold pizza , close but not quite .
1	i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better . the lyric , vocal , instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen .
0	did not download a expected , emailed amazon , no answer !
0	sick . trash deleting asap
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co-writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception . however , unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album , this song is not very magical . in fact , it fall flat on the floor . the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time . the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to . sorry , lenny . maybe next time ! 2 star . end note : at least he still look good though . i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt , and le clich and boring . this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic .
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be . a lot of the song i have never heard before .
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
1	i think that 50 cent newest cd get rich or die tryin is great . he is the hottest thing on the street right now . everyone is bumppin 50. get rich or die tryin got alot of cameo and it sound great it better than ja rule ! haha
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not . either way , like it or not , once you hear it , it is stuck in your head . i am one of those who like it , hence , that is why i downloaded it . it may not be the greatest song ever done , but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick .
0	love the song . hate the download process through amazon . i do not want your player amazon . you made the normal download link to small , like fine print . took me too long to figure out . made me grouchy .
0	very frustrating ! you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song . unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy , from the same band doing the same song , only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it ! wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than 20 second long in a part of the song that might be helpful ! or provide info that more clearly say , recent re- recording !
1	it is great ! i love it
0	censored version , but it had the explicit label
0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to alexa
0	quality of recording is not perfect ? * %
1	i love the song white christmas . michael and shania make a very good duet couple . very good christmas song for anyone .
0	of all the song to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track , this one about the worst you could pick . i previewed some of her other track . not great . but definitely not a bad a this track . i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one . not good .
0	back in the very early 90 , i had this ( the cassette tape version ) and thought it wa amazing . until i bought the cd recently , i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me . it wa almost painful to listen to , and i remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music ! i would only recommend this for laugh or a 90 nostalgia night .
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me . mean a lot !
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. you are husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
1	the story wa good . the music wa so so . we hail from new jersey . and grew up listening to the four season . we used to follow them intensely . wherever they were appearing . we know their sound . the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong . he wa singing to falsetto . you know over doing . this is our opinion , but then again we are jersey girl !
0	sorry all you dude who will flip over this but using god name that way over and over is childish and ignorant ! like the uneducated idiot that can not make a sentence without a foul word in it . seriously guy it unintelligent !
1	love it
1	a mellow , infectious , romantic love song , not only for the female specie , but most definitely for guy who are truly in love .
1	heard this song on the radio a few time and loved it . when i finally found out the name , i bought . it is cute and catchy , preview it and see ( hear ) for yourself = )
1	a
1	you have to consider , though , that music of this kind sort of play itself , and a far a i am concerned , the organist must just not get in the way of it . walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue , which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard , and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned . towards the end , i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed , still keeping within a modest forte . because there are no extreme of dynamic , i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car , where extreme softs and louds are problematic . ( modern equipment can do compression , which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car , so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration . ) bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy , but it hold up beautifully . i recommend it , and the entire set .
1	even switchfoots b-sides are amazing ! any fan would love this ep
1	a good , clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series . to hear it would always take me back to the early 70 . now , it reminds me of that tv series .
0	i downloaded this song because it wa free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
1	love this song . start my day out with it .
1	i love this album ! a very anointed project !
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flutist that i wa looking for . i wa very disappointed that it wa not !
0	it sounded good on the clip . after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be .
1	best cd i bought in a year . i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing .
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly . after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post-2004 , they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence . unfortunately , this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea , resulting in track that i would never expect from this band . destroyer already start this off on an iffy note , with it rhythm section going for the big , loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena . bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing-along chorus . vice grip , the first single , also follows in this vein . then we have track like crushed , which first bite off heaven shall burn , then sound like they are attempting to be some 3rd rate rage against the machine knockoff . writing on the wall is a complete joke , with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you , complete with dubbed in violin . whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity , i actually like the track dedicated , a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound , and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well . it is not a complete loss of an album , but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound . i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist .
1	wonderful song ! great lyric and a really catchy tune . you will be singing this one even when it is not playing : ) let love explode and bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is surely alive he is living on the inside roaring like a lion !
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album , which i think is great ! this one did not deliver like that one for me but i am still listening to it . i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening . usually for me when an album doe not hit me right away , it will a little later , well see .
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label . the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin . the singer is brigitte fassbaender . warning regarding fassbaender . in da klangende lied , the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part . but in all the other piece in the two disc , the vocal are more prominent . it is therefore the case that in these other piece , the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most . fassbaenders singing style ( if you want to call it singing ) includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato . this bizarre , exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted , to be a perversion , and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition . when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording , it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed , irritated , and angry . in some kind of music , such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins , or in grindcore music , such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass , the distorted voice is the point of the recording , and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience . but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music . also , fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you . for this reason , i recommend only da klagende lied , but am not able to recommend the other piece on this 2-disc set . the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler , and they consist of da klagende lied , kindertotenlieder , de knaben wunderhorn , lied eines fahrenden gesellen ( all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ) , and ruckert leider ( all five song are here ) . only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation . this review provides a side-by-side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle . the rattle recording is slightly better , for reason disclosed below . this review also provides a side-by-side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn ( the song about the fish ) with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado . the abbado recording is slightly better , for the reason listed below . second-by-second account of waldmarchen . this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied , one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire . waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum . at the 6 second point , the french horn provide a short riff . then , at 18 second , the flute join in . the french horn resume at 23 second , and at 24 second , the reed and string join the fray . at 33 second , the french horn join in again , and here they play a real tune , not just a riff . at 50 second , the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch , and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch . at one minute and 37 second come a momentary crescendo . it is a big crescendo , but there is not any crash of cymbal . these timing are for the rattle recording . this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording , with the nit-picky exception that i list below . the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second , but the rattle recording start with music , not with any hum . comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle . the chailly timing is 28 minute and 8 second , while the rattle timing is 28 minute and 31 second . in the chailly recording , the tenor ( werner hollweg ) make his entrance at 5 min , 36 sec , singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire . mr. hollwegs voice is slightly tinny . in the rattle recording , the tenor ( robert tear ) make his entrance at 5 min , 23 second . robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding , somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff . thus , i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording . for reason unknown to me , the chailly recording ha a tenor ( werner hollweg ) and a bass ( andreas schmidt ) , while in contrast , the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone . the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea . the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann . there is no discernable difference to my ear , in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording . hochzeitsstuck . the chailly recording clock at 18:32 , while the rattle recording is 18:57. the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum , a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass , and blaring brass . this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off-stage band , which is much quieter than the on-stage orchestra . the off-stage band can be heard , for example , in the interval of 2:16 to 3:12. when the off-stage band is playing , the only other source of music is vocal soloist , at least for this interval of time . this movement also feature a chorus preference . for the following reason , i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied . the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume , and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic . in contrast , the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy . also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice , over the tinny voice of hollweg . the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff ( baritone ) and anne sofie von otter ( mezzosoprano ) , a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label . on the chailly recording , there are only three song , a i mentioned above , and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato . in the abbado recording , some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female . my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish , and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no . 2. anyway , this compare the fish song ( de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording . notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at 20-30 second and 60-65 second , and the five second donkey-like braying from clarinet that occurs at 60 second and again at 105 second . the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong . i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason . first of all , the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo . also , in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured , because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute , and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato . the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording . also , the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon , and to my ear , the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording . to reiterate these point , what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound , and the more easily discernable fluttery flute , donkey braying , and mysterious chinese gong . conclusion . the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony . a careful side-by-side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording . i did my own side-by-side comparison , and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado . da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition , and it ha been my favorite since the year 1972. it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
1	stylistically , i love all type of music . but , how do i classify fireflights album , for those who wait album - is it indie , is it rock - i do not know ? but , what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work ! drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band - with fireflight , there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person - and , the driving vocal of pat benatar , and pop musicality of the go-gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs . ( thanks , pooh for the great word , smackerl , you silly ole bear ) . yet , although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular-bands-of-yore-oh-so-great in fireflights unique sound - i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh - and dare i say anointed ? check out the band website - [ . ] . they have their video available for your viewing pleasure . there is a genuine story being told in each song - i assure you .
1	my kid love this song ! it is so much fun to listen to and sing along with . bonus , i do not get tired of hearing it .
0	the recording is not good . the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance . i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one . i think i made a mistake of choosing this version . his you tube music ha better recording than this one .
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music . that is what i consider this . along with the postal service , music to fall asleep to .
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation . check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion .
0	terrible use of auto-tune .
1	love it , fun dance song
0	it is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it . it wa just some breathing noise and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy . i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling . would not reccomend
0	please get it off my kindle i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough those of u with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of .
1	awesome song !
0	not to much into the hard rock sound .
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument . everybody think it wa korn , but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage . you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn , nickelback , and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the 1990s . almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana- monotone vocal that explode into raging scream , wall of distorted guitar noise , and whiney lyric about how miserable life is . do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll ? nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing . nirvana were not about music . they were about conformity and nothing more . just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable , immature , whiney suburban teenager from their money . they were the backstreet boy with guitar , basically . the linkin park of 88-94. i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last decade .
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel , the da song soon ! and narration by chuck smith . really , if you have shotgun angel , there is little reason to buy this . if you do not have shotgun angel , get it instead . if you are buying this for the song soon ! ( which is the weakest song on it ) get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead . if you are buying this for the narration , it is not worth it . i can not criticize the biblical passage , though not particularly well read ; but the interpretive part is not well done . i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement , but i knew this would be the case before buying the album ; i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile - and it would have , had i not already had all the song . the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision . i really felt like only giving this one star , but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for , were they not better found in their original context ( shotgun angel ) .
1	. but not the people that sold it to me . it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front . very disappointed . : (
1	tragically , it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world , the great natalie cole . but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie , is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart . something that many of her diva like rihanna , beyonc , britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all . instead , they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone . natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the 80 , that nearly derailed her career and her life . in the 90 , she made peace with the passing of her beloved father , nat king cole , and went into jazz music , after year of r & b . but she had some great song for everyone alone . a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end . she flexed her sweet , and beautiful voice in the movie track , with the same title name from 1997. it is a lovely song , and i think of this song from natalie , a one of her best in her lifetime . it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love . i miss natalie so much , but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice , with a deep heart . natalie cole : 1950-2015 song : b+
1	great ep
1	some of my favorite music from back in the 80 . brings back so many wonderful memory ! the cd arrived in perfect condition !
0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case ! i am livid !
1	great album wet dream , and hello are definitely stand out song for me . hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja-rule day back where mc were willing to sing their own hook and i think j. cole doe it well on the track he doe it .
0	a much a i really wanted this to work , it absolutely did not ! the voice is irritating rather than soothing . the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective . a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better . considering all of the experience this guy ha , i expected so much better . do not buy it , it is a waste of your money .
1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever . the movie is great , and so is the soundtrack . kevin spacey doe a great job all around !
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic . unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up . i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl , but the seller did list this a good condition yet 90 % of it wa unplayable . very disappointed .
0	the whole mp3 is just noise , not good noise , not even a lot of noise but noise . what a bunch of hooey . do not click on this one . the only reason i wa looking wa i tried steve g. jones and in two night have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choice when eating . it is also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep . but this one - boo hiss stay away . glad i only wasted $ .99 . whew .
1	attunement is a true miracle . a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid , spectacular sound . those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed . but in the lens of dembys all-encompassing camera obscura , attunement range from the raw , sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus . the texture are constantly changing , like the color and fragrance of a secret garden . you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before . such is the power of attunement . this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition ( spontaneous combustion ? . it doe smoke at time . the fire from the earth inner core ) a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure !
0	would not download . error in file name .
0	got a free download for purchasing cd from amazon . tried to download , but wa not successful . tech support from amazon non-existent . i am sure it wa opperator error , but they only give you one chance . i have let other free download offer expire . not worth the hassle . love billy joel , have album , cassette , and cd .
1	great album ! i am in love !
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to . 1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
0	ok
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship . it is not cry , but mere acceptance of the inevitable . toni braxton sound beautiful in it .
1	this is an absolute classic . it brings me back to the day when michael wa but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
0	only got this for a friend .
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement . always disappointing . be forewarned . it wa revealed in very small print .
0	i downloaded this track by accident . this is the live version of the song . i wanted the original studio version .
1	it is pure pink .
0	come on . it is christmas . really ? did she really have to make a vulgar song ? she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday ? it is the season of hope and joy , yet lady gaga is producing this . i have never had a problem with her other work . up until now that is . and to top it all off , amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion .
1	awesome !
0	i downloaded it thinking that i could use it and hear it . it wa lost in my harddrive somewhere and now i just wasted a $ 1.00
0	i reely thank this is just badily , i will not lake it becaz it is joust a bunch of dude singan about in clubbing and other stuff that blackies . i do not lake to here aboot this crape , he iz onely a musicer becaz he got shoot 9 tames . this cd doe not like to . i do not . i thank this cd is not soundful bat mast cd now day a. arent . not . i doo nat lake this at , all . thes guy is not gad he canot sang . he cannto . maybe i joust do not like dark tone skin . or naybe mot . who care . do not buy , i recceomend you to buy this , not . not to reccomend it is to buy me . please do nat buy or reckomend it . dont . do not . no love ! dont !
0	ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information . wa not like the picture . returned 1st one and ordered a second which wa identical to the first . also wa returned .
1	great
0	nothing of great interest . mostly a vanity project . quite disappointing , really .
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through .
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak , however , not stating this is 45 second long is almost misrepresenting itself . in fact , it is . listen to the free clip - you have heard 70 % of the interview . shame on you , amazon !
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra , with mary martin doing the singing . that is the plus , a it is always a pleasure to hear her . why should not i is the third standard ( or maybe it is an almost standard ) from cole porter jubilee , and definitely a favorite song of mine . this is a very good straight version , without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it . the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse , which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric ( e.g . i must find some kind persona grata , to give me data , personally ) . for that reason , i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song .
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame a rape victim

1	fun song , love it
0	very disappointed in this cd . it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song , too annoying to listen too .
0	it is ok
0	ok
1	this is a great song with a great message . yolanda adam is one of the best gospel/inspirational singer ever . king kong aint got nothing one her ! ( lol )
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing . best of all , why should i be scared of you ? is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more . dig it .
0	the worst try-hard band i have ever heard - how did these turd get an album out ? oh yeah - rich parent . ugh , lovely . it suck , do not waste your money .
1	best duo
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone . i just love to listen to him sing
1	awesome cd . listen all the way through .
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument . undoubtedly , sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra , the london classical player , are a highlight of this recording . the music is played with precision , a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically . what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the 5th symphony , which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording . norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work - his interpretation of beethoven 2nd and 8th symphony are , in some way , his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle . i listened to the 5th yesterday , when i wa feeling very low , and it put me in a much better frame of mind . we all need music like this sometimes . i have needed it a lot lately . sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having . i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it . modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous , heavy and stodgy . a recording for people who like fresh , crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar , washed down with chilled chardonnay , and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat , stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table !
0	yuck
0	the version of the song is not my favorite . unfortunately , i think this is the only version released . i even tried to find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able .
1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again . she is back and this album outshines believe . cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful voice to send these song through the roof . song for the lonely will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today . alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible . when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track . people - buy this album . let u put cher at number 1 again where she belongs !
1	great song . country at it best !
0	pearl jam is the band that basically told mtv to f- off after their first album - nirvana is the band that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout , pearl jam got huge because of their music & they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated , phony fake band ever - pearl jam is truly the greatest band ever , pearl jam stuck by their word , cobain never did fact : cobain used to call mtv & tell mtv to play nirvana music video more
0	ok not what i expected
0	unimpressive music .
0	i very rarely bother to write a review , unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something . unfortunately this is the latter . i have always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak , materialistic , egotistical , club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 year now . though every album ha had a different feel to it , i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.this album is slowwwwwed down . tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music . not everything ha to be 300 mile per hour of awesomeness , but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either . the dj wa completely uninspired . i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist . usually a complex mixture of big brass , synthesizer , different time signature , other genre of music thrown in , and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around , this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music . the lyric are amazing a usual , you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album ( the only reason i am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 ) dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd.most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good , then slows down horrifically for the last two parts.there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album.the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n9ne cd . sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system . not the reason i buy tech n9ne . if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays . like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time . he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo . i am sure it will sell well . i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n9ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again .
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa ! maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again . i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year ! i feel ripped off and so disappointed !
0	package wa sent back originally because it wa too damaged . i had to re-order the product and when i received it the case wa severely damaged any ] way .
1	love this song , reminiscent of grover washington jr. great style and warmth .
0	did not like the song at all . i remove it from my download . very disappointed in the way it is song and the music .
1	i love his music and message
0	i am from mxico . i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality , too much surface noise and not very good sound . i decided not to get the next one . but when my favorite maiden album ( this one and 7th son ) came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity . i have to say it wa the same disappointment . they do not even sound nearly a my 80 uk edition . whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection . i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl . too much surface noise and tick and pop . please , if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl .
1	fantastic voice that jive well with the retro sound . like a dark , smokey pink martini . i do not have five more word .
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music . i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment . i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition . hey ry , stick to music for everyone .
1	this song is awesome . i am not a huge fan of three day grace , but this is by far my favorite .
1	at the age of 66 and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much . i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her . this wa one of those song . in all there wa 11 song that i picked out . i will have to tell you is wa some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it wa more then worth it . after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level . so if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that express your love for her .
0	you can tell this is not an original , buy the dubbing and sound quality . i have and original jim stafford album from the 70 and this is not the same ouality of sound . suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england ,
1	well it is wreckx-n-effect . what more need to be said . mr teddy riley did it yet again . with this group made up of his brother & cousin he killed the 90
1	louie prima and keely smith , the king and queen of the 50 vega lounge circuit . included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in just one of those thing .
1	great inspirational music .
0	sanjaya wa entertaining on idol . but he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy . this song is terrible ! off-key warbling , non-melodic , soulless . pas this up asap !
1	like it
1	love the song it is so uplifting and i play it three or four time a day just to get moving !
0	. the mp3 is of bad quality . be wary of downloading amazon southern gospel mp3s . i have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad lp or something . edit : my mp3 skipping problem wa traced back to my dial-up connection . be sure to download amazon mp3s via broadband for best music quality .
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube . beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound . plus i love the disco beat . little known now and little info about them anymore . they were popular in europe in the early 80 . i think they were english but played a lot in germany . do not think they did much in the u .
1	what is there not to like with billy currington . i excercise to must of done something right . easy slow so start with stretching then upper body movement . i have arthritis . so this is great for me .
0	love the song but this version is barely audible . hello , it is rock , where is the volume .
0	i can not rate this ! it did not open for me . i am unable to open or hear this song . how can i make it open in mp3 form ? help
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life , including a year in vietnam . i used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little . but . . .i really do not think ten new song is all that great . i am glad someone gave it to me , tho .
1	i love bronn journey harp music . thanks .
1	love this vinyl
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive , it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office . one minute you are straining to hear the word , the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down . susan boyle voice is low , almost a mumble , and she sound like a little girl- not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection . i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it .
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan , but i love this new song . it modern , clean , and just a great song . if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album , i think it going to be great .
1	my wedding song thirty-two year ago
0	from [ . ] , dated august 17 , 2008 : the compilation album a closer end , that recently started appearing on the p2p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store , is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg . it is very convincingly made , with a century medium logo , fake barcode and extensive booklet , but it is nevertheless a bootleg . it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing , but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not , and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography , presented a a legitimate release , we feel the need to set the record straight .
1	awesome value ! this is a great mix of classic christmas tune , instrumental and vocal , and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party . for $ .99 there is no better value .
1	terrific !
1	wonderful music , a always by josh groban .
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance . doe not mesh well with the other instrument . need a lot of work .
1	thank you so much , it is fantastic , i truly appreciate it , very very peaceful ! it is amazing the way it make you feel !
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	this is great sound and pink is good in everything that she sings . if you love this like i do get all of her music .
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new york : big sophisticated city image .
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan , so when i saw a cd that we did not yet own , i wa excited to surprise my husband with it . however , when i received it , there wa a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language . i wa shocked ! nowhere on amazon description of this product doe it indicate this . i am shipping it back right away .
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who follow christ . i wa hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party , but can not , it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric . if i would have heard the word of the song before i bought it , i would have not .
0	not what i expected
0	if yo listen to the lyric , terrible ! nice , pop melody though which is probably why it is so popular .
1	a nice smooth song with a meaning .
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago ; considering the book came out in 1993 , i wa so happy to find the music in cd format . because i know the story behind the music , i do not know if the music would stand alone . it is gorgeous , ha a variety of flavor to it . it sound like song from a musical . i would recommend getting both the book and the cd . the book is not a picture book , per se , but a story with illustration . the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone . storyline : a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident . the relative is an older aunt , an anthropologist , living in the outback . she share a story with her niece . so the story within the story is the creation of the earth : when the earth wa ready to be born [ ancient ancestor ] stretched and yawned . and began to roam the planet . a they did , they sang , and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence . when they were done , there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth , sun and moon and star to find out what she really is . the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody , and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia .
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you , but it is just an instrumental version of the song . it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything . i wish i had known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want .
0	great music . the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk . it wa very difficult to play my copy . like most people , i have more then one device to play a cd in . this cd doe not work in most of them .
1	i like listening to demi lavatos music . she is pretty good . i bought it for my kindle fire hd . you should like it too .
1	i lost this song from my mp3 album . i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me . this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago .
1	wonderful old song - not covered enough at all .
1	love this song
1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier . watch the speed a it is easy to get lost in the music .
1	jackies voice ha really matured . a other reviewer have said and i agree with , this is hauntingly beautiful . this being the first single from her new album , i really can not wait to hear the other song from the album .
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome .
0	i paid for this song so i could attach it to some picture of my daughter . it would not play the whole thing . i definitely felt ripped off
0	not even enough here to rate ! it cut out and off before you can distinguish anything on it . do not like it .
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan . i own all of their previous album . therefore , i wa all excited for this album to come out , even though , i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait . i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better . they are not ! i would/will not waste any money on this album . it is a very big disappointment , especially judging it based on their previous work . they can and should be putting out better work than this .
0	i accidentally bought it . i hate it . i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it . it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor .
1	great song
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the 90 and 2000s . these song are a great mix of catchy tune , fun lyric , and biblical truth . furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together . the highlight of the album for me is it is alright ( for lazarus ) . i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry . it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death . a few other highlight for me include shame , right wrong girl , and dare i say . truthfully , i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music . it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio .
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite . his first three album are off the chart . but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop . what a bad album . ive waited this long for this . i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound . he need a producer , some one to make dope beat . this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it . im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more . at least the wu keep it real . built for cuban link 2 wa great . reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music ?
0	too much fuzz not enough fan .
1	my student ad i love this song and the video that made u go and buy it . it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone !
0	one song for $ 9.99 ? i guess it is my fault that i did not read the product description , but i wa under the impression , for that price , that i wa getting a full length cd .
0	did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a 50th class reunion power point presentation .
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round . it is so soothing , yet intense at the same time . the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece . i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful , graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent .
1	i love me some brad paisley .
1	billy curringtons album is great . it is one of the best album i have ever heard . billy is going to become one of the top artist in the next few year . every one should buy this album !
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day . but let u face it , back in the day he wa in his twenty . keith is almost 50 year old now and still singing that teenage music . it is time for him to sing some grown up song . his title and lyric are so immature for his age . his voice still sound nice , but he need to grow the heck up ! to his credit , he look fine a hell on his new cd cover , very mature looking for someone so immature !
0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf
0	the song is great . but , this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song , making it impossible for me to listen to .
1	always a classic song . great quality , too .
1	fantastic
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral . and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion .
1	forget ravel bolero . this is the most sensuous , evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone . it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace . share it with someone you love .
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber . this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way , and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother . very inspirational !
0	i will not marry you , woman ! it is rude to keep asking .
0	i went through day of singing this over and over .
1	love this song . nate is a great praise and worship singer .
0	i love ne-yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	not too sure about this one !
1	one of conways sexy song .
0	when wilson first broke into country music , her hit such a redneck woman , homewrecker and here for the party were cutting , fresh and brash . now her latest single , do not do me no good is just uninspired- it sound like the 101th song out there on country radio . an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is . wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself . she should just take her advice when she sings on this track , yeah i know it aint right/to sit around all night and let your memory/get the best of me .
1	-incredible scream -great melodic breakdown -incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is . you can tell this band doe their own thing/has their own style and doe not conform . that is what make them great . con : album is a little too short , some of the song sound similar
0	way too much applause at the end .
0	mostly instrumental .
1	dr. octagon paramedic fetus of the east with priest , i am from the church of the operating room . with the strike support scalpel since the holocaust , i do indeed in greed explore meet the patient . back to broom with the nurse with the voodoo curse . holding up office light standing at huge height . back and forth , left wing , swing to north , east and south with blood pouring down your mouth . i come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope , listen to your heartbeat , delete beep beep beep ! your insurance is high , but my price is cheap . look at the land . blue flower ! drawing by the purple pond , in the purple pasture blue flower ! drawing by the purple pond , yellow ink that flow blue flower ! drawing by the pond , look , it is raining yellow . would you care to listen to me more ? thank you ! holding bag on down right from the hospital , it is a patient that is worth to keep the germ off the turf . cybernetic microscope and metal antidote , two telescope that magnify the size of a roach . three computer to a cup of coffee planted with my hand and astro-planets detached turn on rear foggers cut the light on the kid , and turn the bright on . supersonic wave combine and burn a brain wave . i see the mascot of evil he is not kneivel . shakespeare gone do not even think about it ! yes , a i am going to the park , i see . blue flower ! it is raining green , by the pond blue flower ! it is totally raining green , pouring blue flower ! i smell the bee and the bird blue flower ! different aspect of life , blue flower .
0	just do not like it , i took it just to check it out and i found out i do not like it .
1	there is just something about him that take me away . he is got this voice that is so unique that talk to your soul .
1	all right , beyonce .
0	i liked both of the single , undead and no . 5 , that came out a while back . i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping . based on the single , which were decent rap metal , i wa expecting a rap metal cd . but this cd actually ha 12 white boy gangsta rap track and 2 rap metal track . huge disappointment and totally not what i wa expecting . the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la , talk about cliche . i think it is fitting that the re-release of this cd is called desperate measure ( to make money . ) i have already given the cd away . i guess if you are a fan of eminem copycat or icp , this is the cd for you , but i do not need to listen to poseur white kid rap about bitch , drug , and double-ds .
1	exactly what i wa hoping for ! heard the title song , you+me , and love that sound . lucky for me all the song sound just a good . listen to it everyday .
0	very highly sought after album . and - it is very well done . to bad it is a pirated cd . this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it , you are supporting pirated music . but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it is site . and this one , it appears , is here to stay . after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale of these type of item .
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work , yet one of his best . a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook . it is unique , it is honest and it is meaningful . the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate , a bottle of wine and quiet evening . i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this .
1	good song
1	always smooth .
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor : when i first heard her 4 or 5 year ago , i thought , wow ! she is really unique and awesome ! . then came her next record and i thought . hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it . she ha managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight record . i think that is a record or something ( pun intended ) . i just want to tell her , yea , we have got it , you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million time for effect .
0	not my kind of music , downloaded them for a funeral
0	this is terrible . anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever . it so overplayed & way overrated .
1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of u .
0	not many good song . a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	i have been a big boc fan since the 1970s , and have gotten most of their album along the way , but imaginos wa one that got away from me . i have seen many online comment about how great it is , and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction . so , when this reissue wa released , i had to pick it up . well . it really doe not do it for me , i am afraid . the problem is that , first of all , it doe not sound like a boc album , and , a i recently discovered , it is not . it is a solo album by bocs drummer , albert bouchard , and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera . despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger , the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another . the rather pointless re-do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with . and if you are going to call this a boc album , you have got ta have buck dharma , who get short shrift here . the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album , apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own . the album is not a total disaster ( i kind of like the baron frankenstein number ) , but i am very glad that i did not pay $ 100.00 for it on ebay ! i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja , and hope to see that happen sometime soon . ( p 07/27/08 : club ninja is coming soon ! )
0	just get yourselves an exocist !
1	this is terry fator . what more can you ask for ? a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan .
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the 70 , but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame . amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music . who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd ?
0	his vocal are too modern country . the song are depressing and mundane . they are all too similar . it just go on for too long .
1	this is great and interesting music . this is music that is both creative a well a being entertaining . i look forward to listening to future music contribution .
0	i came to this wanting to like it . i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever . i have all of rogers solo work , seen him a few time back in the 80 on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour . i am a fan . my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak . if life is really that bad , get a puppy ! i mean , i find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this - i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash . i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here ? i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig ( three different one ) and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death , another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak , i got rid of it . then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it . i never listen to it . this is music to depress yourself to . who need that ? if i want to be depressed i will watch the news . i do not need to hear it in my music . life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race . i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song .
0	these guy are terrible .
0	problem is not the music . but they apparently sent u a blank . four different cd player and not a one can read it . holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track .
1	i wa happy to see that this track wa offered for sale , a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd . i feel that , with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording , this is the best recording of the show out there .
1	for country music fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the music of schuyler , knobloch and overstreet , judy rodman , and schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt , this cd is a must for your collection . this cd cover most of the major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd . judy rodman , who wa a minor success ( and mtm record only artist before folding ) in the early to mid 80 ha several of her best known hit on this release . from the up tempo girl ride horse too to the memory laced until i met you , these two song are just a few of the hard to find gem on any cd of any type . i wa absolutely estatic to find the schuyler , knobloch and overstreet song you can not stop love in this collection . this is a song that i have searched for on cd for 3 year . this cd also ha rarity from the girl next door ( slow boat to china ) , schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt ( baby got a new baby ) , and two becky hobbs selection ( jones on the jukebox , they always look better when they are leavin ) . if you are searching for these obscure recording on cd , this offering will not disappoint you .
0	disappointed . poor subject matter , poor quality .
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music . it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star ( no danse macabre , and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete - just one part from each season ) . but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist . i highly recommend it !
0	i am not a music critic , i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for . i can simply say i did not enjoy the album . one , maybe 2 good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list . i hope they , zac brown band , plan to get back to country again soon . still listening to all of their other album daily .
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
1	great song . i had no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter !
0	imo , this sound like something i couldve done with a toy saxophone . awful . listen to the preview . if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great , then go for it .
1	this is a favorite tune . thanks for the quick delivery to my kindle . i have enjoyed the tune many time and am still enjoying playing it .
1	thank you
0	very disapointing , sound like it is playing to slow . obvisouly a recording problem .

0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	i just like it .
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer .
0	like the other review of this gift , the question is why . why wa this even recorded and released , that is just for starter .
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap . i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted . it wa adverized a being sold on amazon . i decided to buy it . so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon . but it wa not the same version ! only one verse wa in english . i felt extremely disappointed ! i wanted the english version so very much . but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what i wa led to believe i wa buying : the english version of veni sante spiritus ! do not be fooled !
0	ok cd . a few good song but not worth the buy . obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend , this will work
1	great song , long length . thought provoking . brings back good memory from the 90 . you will ask yourself . where wa i when i heard that ?
1	this is one of the greatest tune of the year , if not - ever . however , i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it , but it dosent , so now i get to buy another copy of this cd .
0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa . wasnt the seller fault .
0	richie sounded good when i heard him on howard , but the cd sound overproduced and too electronic . very disappointed and would not recommend .
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ! ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song ! keep up the good work
0	i just do not get the hype about 50 cent . i listened to this , and i think he is a , excuse the pun , two-bit talent .
0	this 1981 recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me , one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest , silliest , and corniest the label ha to offer in new york ( with the exception of the three song i already mentioned . ) this recording wa of course , an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune . the problem here , aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived , is that the three african song ( 1 , 2 , & 4 singed in african dialect and in french ) are totally uneventful , bland , uninspiring , linear , unvaried , monotonous and totally pointless ! . there is nothing happening ! . laba sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising , and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid-back tropical beach feel with a little electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerve ! . the 1st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo ! . it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to , and encourages them to dance it even further ! . song . 2 feature a chorus a long , a annoying and a insipid a : in coc , in coc , in coc de ba saaah , de ba saaah , de ba saaah all the way through till the end ! . other than that , we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique , curacao , ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut ( whatever that mean ! ) and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach ! he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too ! . ( while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth , this is really a bad a it get . ) for song . 4 , i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality , but which still come out pretty well coming from him . the reason why i decided to review this recording ( now that it ha been available under mp3 downloads since the 5th of august 2008 ) is to tell you to download the great 3. maracaibo oriental , the nice 6. pelta ( written by miguel matamros ) and maybe song . 5 anichayi which aint gon na change your world , but which is decent enough not to be skipped ( or bought for just $ 0.89 on mp3 downloads . ) even though this label wa mainly run by african associate ( a pianist alfredo valds jr. explained on his fascinating interview : the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section [ . ] ) i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly , or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality ! i would say each to their own thing ! . therefore , the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competences/knowledge to do it ! i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be ! finally , there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in 1982 , and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one ! there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental , overall the album doe show better with a big hit : diamoul maw , 2 rock-solid cuban tune which also happen to be song . 3 and 6 , and apparently another hit being song . 5 aminata . i would not dare risking recommend it to you all , but check it out anyway & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/laba-sosseh/dp/b001esgx6w/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > laba sosseh < /a > . song . 3 maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno-descrga tune ! it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr. that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end ! . there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate , outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago , amazing 2-trumpets/1-trombone horn arrangement , a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement ! . everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here ! . [ * descrga in latin music term mean jam-session . ] song . 6 pelta ( most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros ) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk . otherwise , the tune is very pleasant , fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement , a tres-guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end . the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta ! [ meaning jerk in spanish slang ] . basically , a simple and great tune ! . for song . 5 ( which is a decent enough son-montno tune ) , i will let you lot take the punt . sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine , but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago , and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those 2 song ! . my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long , lacked melody and were unexciting too .
1	good song .
0	total ripoff ! this is not the whole song , it is like a 30 second sound bite from the song . i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for $ 1.29 . save yourself a buck and do not buy this .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
0	despite this being a label album , it really just another flame album . v rose only get one track to herself , and it the forgettable threw it all away . ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference , the label ha stuck with their two artist . yes , a lot of various artist from reach record , cross movement , and beyond are brought in to add flavor , but it flame project without question . and it ok , but it not a good a flame usual stuff , which ha been declining a of late in my opinion . i am kinda disappointed , a the guest did not shine particularly bright either , so i will give it a 2 , maybe a 2.5 no knock on the message , thats great . but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall .
1	uplifting & encouraging !
0	gardian - voyager & fusion ( 2001 - millenium eight record ) 1 ) instrumental intro 2 ) voyager 3 ) across the universe 4 ) run to the light ( early version of one of a kind ) 5 ) in a world without love ( early version of world without love ) 6 ) i am here ( tony sings and play guitar on this track ) 7 ) prisoner zone 8 ) look to the future 9 ) hyperdrive ( early version of the re-recorded bonus track for first watch ) 10 ) when the time is right 11 ) marching on ( early version of the re-recorded bonus track for first watch ) 12 ) spiritual warfare 13 ) miracle of the galaxy ( early version of miracle ) 14 ) living for the promise ( early version of livin for the promise ) 15 ) eclipse ( not on first watch ) 16 ) rock in victory ( early version of rock in victory ) 17 ) step to the light ( very early version of one of a kind ) 18 ) armored defense 19 ) your love look to the future * = fusion - rock in victory ( ep ) ( 1984 ) ( six song ep - but not sure if it is all here ? ) ( i believe only the last three song are from riv . ) ? = gardian - voyager ( 1987 ) ( how many track on this ? do not know what track are from this , and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from ( maybe a demoed first watch tape or something ? ) * = from the california metal ( comp . ) ( 1987 ) ? = demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff . not sure which were on voyager ? - james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory , tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track . to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff . could not find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager . it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last 3 track ( 17-19 ) . - they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory & voyager . so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here ? - so overall this sound like s * t - but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix . would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up . tony shred !
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd . a a collector of original cast album of flop musical , i regretfully bought that cd . it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album . the insert came straight off of a computer printer , the first band wa silent ( the actual recording started on the second band ) leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement . hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range .
1	yes ! yes ! yes !
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd . i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand . with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere . i really do not know how to describe how i feel . it is not bad music , it is not a bad album . but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band - i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it . i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford & son - other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have . i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke , this is not going to be one of them . it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because - dare i say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing . i am not going to purchase new - i will wait for used and cheaper . not that i think amazon is asking too much - i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar . sorry mumford & son , the album is ok but not what we really liked you for .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	there were a couple of top 40 song from this album , but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound .
1	her usual perfect music . love it .
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol , boring !
1	love this song !
0	this is not the full song , it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration . i actually want my money back . do not buy !
0	for the elevator or dentist office . i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here . but i wa a big fan . and yes , i gave the cd several try , all the way through . even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album . it is just milk toast . dull , uninspired and uninspiring . sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm ( really ? ) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out , and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off . yes , mumfords voice is gorgeous , but not enough to save the album . hey , fame and fortune is tough , but they made it through 27. i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited .
0	too much talking
0	i purchased the mp3 but could not download it . i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again . it doe not work and all the thing they told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to contacting them . they were no help and i am out .99 ( big deal ) but still have no song .
0	not only is she a horrible singer . she support cop killer . she is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video . please do not support her !
0	this is not the original version .
1	this song came out in the 90 and i remember having this cd at the time . this wa one of their big hit along with i want u. i love this song because the group came along with a new sound . they were in when grunge rock ruled , but along come savage garden , what a blessing . the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric , i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic , 80 , an 90 . a great band for those of u who whated something besides those grunge band . kris l. cockayne

0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back . his version is amazing . if you buy his version through february , proceeds go to charity ! if you buy this version , you will be supporting glee , who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit . no , thank you !

1	keeping it real .
0	7 second of what , the hunger game intro ? do not get this download . you will regret it . need i say more .
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd ? i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright , but , being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album , i wa certainly looking forward to more than this . a were my pink floyd - loving friend who listened to it . sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album , but would work a add-on lead done live . i hate to think poorly of these guy , but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off-hand way . nothing at all to sink your teeth into . wa this a contractual obligation album ? resting on their laurel ? it will sell because of who we are ! guy , please do not end your musical career a a band with this one !
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy .
1	this wa a pretty good album , i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs ( that still belongs to to the pain ) , but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band , i would like to see them do more solo though . pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor , my two personal favorite on the album were pin & needle and never cared before .
1	a damn awesome song .
1	this is a very good sounding mp3 download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
0	i wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not .
0	nancy sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault ! she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon .
1	this is so sweet . frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon , but listening carefully , and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night . frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis , blind boy fuller and john jackson . this guitar-as -piano style , in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note , is a rich sound , one at which frank is very much in control . from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change , frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint . the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite . highly recommended .
0	audio is terrible
0	i want a new online music store , i want a new music store , one that do not just sell mp3s , one that will sell me original cd quality downloads , one that will take the time to respect the music , one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should . seriously bought one single just to test it out , cause i do not want to pay $ 40 , for the original cd ( reprint ) . i am not a audio snob , but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup . i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format . i would gladly pay an extra $ 5 dollar or whatever for wav handling , i do not think this is too much to ask . amazon or itunes can not seem to comprehend this .
0	it ok but not iggys best
1	classic redman . glad to see him back
1	lady gaga - cheer to you darling , this song is fabulous ! i highly recommend you buy it . i did and i will never regret it . this is a song you can listen to over and over again . wonderful ! : )
0	the song is fine , but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro , like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny .
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place . have yet to open the case because it is a gift , but hopefully it is ok .
1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70 . other hit song by them were hey , nineteen , rikki do not lose that number , deacon blue and do it again .
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack , never in my life . never thought i would , for that matter . but , after watching tron : legacy , i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie , but i loved the music ! it is amazing , a this review title say . : ) i usually always have playing on my mp3 player thousand foot krutch and fm static , my favorite band . so i thought it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff ( since tfk is hard rock ) , but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning . i would definitely recommend this album . get the whole thing . it rule . and , btw , i am becoming a very big tron fan , thanks to this awesome cd ! and i watched the first tron , and i really really enjoyed that one . i think everyone need to watch that one if they have seen , or are going to see , the second one , because it really help to understand it all . thank you all you tron people !
1	this is a good song do not wa easy to download with no problem at all sure the album is good
0	not good

1	great music . very inspirational .
0	the background is not a background ! you can listen the kid singing
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer . the beat are pretty nice . if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat , that have a very raw/rough feel and sound . the right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal , etc on top . if , however , someone is looking for larger selection of beat , some with music , they could check out heat beat vol 1 by royalty free , then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league , or something like that . hope this help
1	have 3 of their cd and love all three . love how they bring some old song back to new life god is great !

1	excellent song !
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret , or even fire garden . but gospel and blue type singing ? . kind of a turn off . i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album . and that hurt to say .
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased . i will find something better . not worth it .
1	fabulous music , love the violin and the piano in the background . the music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me . one of the best cd ever !
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass . this portion is so moving , i can listen to it over and over .
1	phenomenal !
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in . not good to work out to .
0	great song !
1	he is a young george straight . nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music . i hope he ha a great career .
0	awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [ lp ] is pretty bad ! my copy ha pitting on a couple song so the needle jump . the fun side of buying vinyl i guess . then when i go online to download with the given code i am told that it not valid a the code ha already been redeemed . total fail !
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for . not much to say about a music mp3
1	sound like old school veruca salt . recommended .
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and did not want to buy an album with a bunch of music i did not want .
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style . i wa very disappointed . his sound doe not work with these song . it is not enjoyable . the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic , which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound , but the choice of song wa wrong . sorry bob !
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album . monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement .
0	i love the original video recording , but this version add way to much instrument background music . make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song .
1	nice
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video . i did not like the rap in the middle , did not seem to fit the song .
0	i like the cd or better said , prince music . my problem is the packaging is crap . i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out . the cd snapped like a potato chip . seriously . product quality mean everything , not just the music .
1	louisville represent . love supporting artist from my home state . laid back soul . you got ta listen to this .
1	prince wa ahead of his time on this one . my grandchild like it and the older one understand it too .
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
0	product sucked got it and it skip very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad .
0	i love this song , but the amazon music app will not play it or save it to my phone .
1	beautiful song
1	great voice ! this is a wonderful album to listen to . well worth the $ 5
1	that voice , this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe . love is grand , so appreciate it . because everything fade away .
1	i love her music , it is great to listen to . she is one of the great singer in the world right now . i love playing her song .
0	ordered and paid for 3 song . only one song down loaded . amazon site said all 3 were down loaded . my e-mail to them for help wa never answered . customer service suck !
1	listening to him is so relaxing
0	if i wa having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in anytown , usa and this came on mid movement , i would committ hari kari . it is that terrible . this make shania twain sound like mozart .
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download . i absolutely love this song , it ha good sound quality , but they cut off the entire last word/note ! it drive me crazy and really ruin the track .
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your private chopped off . thats all i have to say , no 50 cent , it is not my birthday , and we are not gon na party like it my birthday , especially not to your crappy music . have a nice day
0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album . though i do not prefer spanish singing , some song are nicely done . but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous 2 duet album . with all the great classic song to pick , why recycle the same song ? i do not get it .
1	jojos voice is truly gifted ! she ha comeback with great force and can not wait for further music from her in the future ! this tringle is great !
0	if it where possible , i would leave zero star ! one of the worst album i have ever purchased .
0	wack
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin , please note that i really wanted to like this album , and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii . for those who are die-hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you . i am not going to review each track , because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea . ever since untouchable , there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album , and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head , both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar . untouchable wa a good album , not great . mirror wa still decent , and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . however , a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album . i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue , and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . when you listen to their early work , the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue . with the release of untouchable , the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the 1950s . with each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus . this is not to say the album released since 2000 have been bad , they just are not worthy of a 5-star rating . this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two , but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio wave . doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? yes . doe he growl more ? sure . are the lyric memorable . no . doe the music stand out ? not really . i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material , but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge , and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . in 6 month , listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp3 player . they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great . i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression . either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul . the album is not terrible , but it is unremarkable and candidly , it is also forgettable . my $ .02
0	low sound quality . i deleted .
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far ! can not wait to hear the rest of their album . the boy are awesome and so talented !
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of 52 year . what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer .
1	beautiful !
1	come on it is led zeppelin : d
1	ahhhhh i love this song !
0	definitely need to be remastered .
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song . if this is a good a his song writing get , he need to set down the pen . god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single . i can not help but think of fergie when i hear this song . it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump . except , in this situation , there is a man singing it . it make my stomach churn a i think about it . are there no good male songwriter left in this country !
1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love . i love the honest , open worship . if you enjoy bethel type worship , then you will love worshipmob . i can not wait for another cd by them .
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness ! do i really need to say anything ? if your a jimi fan , buy it and listen !
1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song . i just had to get it for her .
0	i love him , not a much a he doe , but i have enjoyed all his music to this point . you can find song like this on any album in the genre , nothing wa added to the music world from this album .
1	what a great song !
1	dark , but great song . and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar . liked it , good value for the price and convienient to download . i love amazon .
0	i never ordered this . i hope it wa free .
0	actually , it did not . the first tune wa nice , but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all . if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake , and i just found it too irritating .
0	i am sorry , i hate to be rude or insensitive . people like what they like i know , however , i have to say that this is the worst song ever ! the fact that ne-yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe . the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard . i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous , horrible lyric and nasally singing . how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once . the first time is enough torture , seriously ! the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good ! it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up . i like ne-yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired . this song suck badly ! i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h_ll this crap could be called music . many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it !
1	love it , great song .
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1 ? mr. big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit . he is so emotional . it must be from the bottom of his heart
1	with their sophmore album , lifehouse ha defenitely improved . their sound ha matured and become so much better ( not that no name face wa bad ) . the album first single , spin , is very energetic and uplifting ( and the video made me dizzy ) . a few other track to note are anchor , which is a powerful song , am i ever gon na find out , which is incredibly catchy , take me away , another very powerful one , and the beginning , which is beautiful enough to make me cry . lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall . i strongly recommend it .
1	cool !
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station . i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood ( iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station ) . anyhow from my perspective , see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im ready to aim . the music complement the song a well .
0	purchased this and it never did show up in my account .
0	when i bought this dvd i wa expecting to get the famous cali lifestyle 2 dvd . instead i got the audio cd with a small sample of creeper present cali lifestyle 2. the small sample dvd only contains about 4 minute of video footage from creeper cali lifestyle 2 dvd . if you want the full dvd contact cali finest production . you can also buy the full dvd just a long it doe not contain the audio cd . i wa very dissapointed with this purchase .
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album . i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them . so i will not spend the money to buy the entire album . when this song is available to download individually , let me know and you just might get a sale .
1	always liked simon & garfunkel .
0	meh , not my type i guess .
1	this wa a well received gift . can not go wrong with john lennon anything .
1	classic
0	i did not like it because i wa looking for lp not single . anyways , i sent it back and i wa quickly processed for money return . it wa needing more information on the add .
1	i saw ruben win on american idol , love his singing .
0	wow . a christmas album featuring a rhodes ! ? i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room , so i wa elated to see this cd . but it is not played on a rhodes . it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard , complete with cheezy drum track . it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano . what a disappointment . all the song are very stiff , a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live . i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title .
0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past . the word of god renews my spirit daily !
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon-to-be christmas classic ! well done , p-unit !
0	i am so disappointed in the last 3 i bought b/c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song , rearranged or in a different language . this is very poor representation especially for a new group . whoever made those decision should be fired . their objective should b to make new follower , not loose them . i have purchased 15 dvd a present and 2 new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label .
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned 6. she love it . we listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip . it brought me to tear to hear the old song that shaped my spirituality when i wa young , and i am so thrilled i can share it with my daughter .
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this . would never listen to it ( and i tried ) .
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here . been a slipknot fan since the beginning . all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree . but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion . it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal . most cd grow on ya a time go . but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clip in a song or two . that is because these song are all over the place . they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start . the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them . i do not agree with those saying this is iowa 2.0. this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer . skip this chapter .
0	this should be a lot better . however it is not . do not waste your money . sorry brian
1	i could not wait for bruno to drop his new album . i love his style . i grew up listening to different genre of music . my mom wa r & b . dad loved funk/soul and all true 80 baby should love new jack swing . he wa able to incorporate all of it on 1 album . hand down a masterpiece . whole album on repeat .
1	road trip music
0	i do not think anyone over the age of 16 like ( or can relate to ) nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed ( playing gig in a band doe not count ) . once you become become of that age , the most important thing are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school . clearly , the people here are the pre-teen target audience . look at the misspelling , look at the abbreviation of even simple word , and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves . they would do anything for kurdt and are easily-lead . just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it . if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day , would you enjoy that ? same concept with these song . people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment . just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it .
1	great
0	after a couple of day , song refused to play . had to download from another server .
1	love it .
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want . amazon . a little warning next time please . i still cant find the song i did order . anybody can help with this ? im going in circle here . secondly , the song wa annoying at first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy . cross between old beatles music and alternative rock . least it not filled with suicide , violence and cursing . i will be looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo , not a bad idea . agaion , amazon , a little warning next time before you just dump something on them . you need to make your uploading process easier . this is getting to be too much work for too little . i may stick to itunes
1	grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled time it is no suprise . but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love . the theme song deputy this in a haunting way .
1	the song re-interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them . this might be a christmas album , but the music is not limited to only that time of year .
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen to . i recomend it highly although i do not recomend the second set 100 more piano masterpiece .
0	very old school , but wa looking for the song for a frend
1	this is my favorite version of valerie : it ha personality , class , great performing style . oh , it is beautiful . i realy wish that it would be her signature song , not the i am not going to rehab , ( no , no , no , ) one .
1	you can b. sure that this tune is still great ! get it now ! it will bring back old memory , and sound all new at the same time .
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song . it really resonates with the pain i am current healing from . thank you , plumb .
1	lov it
1	when the name van mccoy come up , if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late 1970s , it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle . mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to # 1 on the billboard hot 100 in 1975 , and wa billboard # 22 most popular song of that year . fast forward a year to 1976 , where mccoy released another song with a similar , albeit lighter sound , called the shuffle . though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial ( and maybe it got used that way at some point ) , it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music . i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song , but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go . if you do , perhaps you will clue u in !
0	i agree with eric , who reviewed this cd , like him i find this cd not too attractive . other than the hit song heard it all before , sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album . the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor , which could be labeled a light cuisine . a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good . i would not dare to compare her to kelly price , she might have a potential , but she is still got a long way to go to get there .
0	just not the same a bon jovi
1	great
1	love the work wish the cd had more track !
1	i love this song ! nick voice is so hot ! it is always my ringtone around valentine day ! i do wish him and jess were still together but i still love it !
1	nice
1	you can not help but tear up when listening to this song . it is an amazing song amd lea made it even better !
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful , full baritone , and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful , timeless song , but i found myself surprisingly disappointed . he is done something to change his technique , and he often sound nasally , especially when he sings word with the e vowel . i think he is been ill-advised in this latest singing technique , and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method !
0	i really did not find any of it funny , not a single redeeming quality to be found . usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at . not the case with this one , it is just devoid of charm or humor . it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea . i wish i could un-listen to it , do not waste your time .
0	basically my sister ( 16 year old ) is listening to this garbage in the other room , and it is aggravating ; i do not like shopping at the mall , and this music is teleporting me there . it is the definition of insipid , and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy , and thus spending dough . in other word , this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience . it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though . to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small , and the world at large . anyone who like this doe not like music , but i would not know , i do not like music either-i like mogwai-good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock . for if it dunnae rock ti piss
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap-rock band , in detail . i am not one of those people . for me , this genre is a side dish , not the main course , but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it . new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album , numb : the same anger , the same desperation , the same hard edge . but i think that frontmen tac and hash , while working from this genre , wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance . tac ha stated : . it is a snapshot of our generation right now . the way a lot of u feel in a time of war , technology , pain and love . it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today . i have felt this way , but i have not articulated it , even to myself . abicas lyric reflect this state of affair , and musically they draw on various influence . the main one i notice are linkin park , hollywood undead and of course , eminem . the lyric cover the whole range of problem - political , personal and social . the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album : if everything that mattered to me is now gone . now take a closer look and tell me what you see . track 2 , tell u why , continues with the directly political : we are underground . before you say goodbye , you have got to tell u why . thing get more personal in turn me on , which seems to be about people questioning one route to self-satisfaction . in my song and the thing you think i say , the anguish is over failed relationship . the pursuit ha the line just let me in . if i get the chance to play , i think you will want me to stay . beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time : you are beautiful , so { censored } beautiful . i would be a little more complete if i just had you . just another , never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense , demanding and hypocritical . a for musical influence , there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable . three of the track open with melodic , solemn piano , which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious . i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of , say , nine-inch nail . gave em a reason open with dance music element , then includes some excellent guitar work , both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic , spiritual , up , and grunge is depressing , scary , down . several track have a synth-string background that give them a more mainstream sound . just another includes military-style drumming and army-march lingo . release from numbness come in the final track what you see , with an ironic twist . they sing , open up your eye . nothing more to hide . now the time ha come/and all this go away , and i am not { censored } numb . look around , nothing ever heals the pain . the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them . it could almost be an 80 pop-rock track , and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting . hmmmm . the album is full of explicit language ( which i had to censor in this review ) , so if you are one of those people who can not take that , by all mean stay away . but if you are ok with free expression , you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while .
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song , it is a little different but it is okay
0	rip teleka . this man took your life . i am sorry that people think he some kind of god . but your god will bring you justice someday !
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast , bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word . can not wait for the album .
0	disappointed . nothing like their first track .
0	ok
0	not impressed
