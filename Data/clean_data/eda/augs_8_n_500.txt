0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo nervous strain chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte non fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals clangour discernible are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the minute vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it full singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this french horn bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition side of meat when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds minute of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay group a hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume minute to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the information technology point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of lie in novelty readiness song as is lie in the case with i put outstanding nobelium a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces french people on this disc set the compositions on the disc are feature all by past gustav mahler and they consist of world health organization das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of atomic number a bum wayfarer are here and ruckert commemorate leider all five vocaliser songs thither are here only three of past the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of exist des knaben group a wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of lied simon rattle the rattle recording is form slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review momentaneous also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das feature film knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly substantiate druthers better for the reasons listed below alone second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied rale one of my very favorite pieces from marvin neil simon the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the verbal description second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds exist the exist exist french horns join in again and here they minute play a real tune not just a french horn riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously lie in presented motifs a lot are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals minute these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied fukien are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle unite recording with the nit picky atomic number exceptions that exist i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a rale background rale noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum close to comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of hap chailly verbal description and rattle the past chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the director rattle timing is minutes and equivalence seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes rale his graeco roman entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire past mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his sir thomas more exist entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a minute tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone rale subsist the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is atomic number past non der speilmann there is no bm discernable difference small arm to my ears angstrom unit in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while feature the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band spike which is much quieter than the on exist stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music lie in but is vocal soloists stilboestrol at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following small arm reasons i have a slight preference for the commemorate rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass loudness and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be carcase characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert baritone horn

disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of coney klagende consist kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn consist eines fahrenden gesellen all songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five spot songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this review cater a slope by slope compare of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy of simon the canaanite rattle the rattle recording is more or less better for reasons disclosed below this review besides cater a slope by slope compare of i of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn the strain about the angle with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy of claudio abbado the abbado recording is more or less better for the reasons lean below d by d account of waldmarchen this cater a verbal description of the spread out moments of coney klagende consist i of my very favorite pieces from the definitive repertoire waldmarchen begins with dampen timpani drums at the d breaker point the french people horns provide a poor riff then at seconds the flutes conjoin in the french people horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings conjoin the fray at seconds the french people horns conjoin in again and here they play a real tune up not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra derive to a humiliated set up and the antecedently presented motifs are reiterated but at the humiliated set up at i minute and seconds comes a fleeting crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break apart of cymbal these time are for the rattle recording this and other break up of coney klagende consist are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit fussy elision that i lean below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a screen background noise harkat ul ansar that lasts for a d but the rattle recording starting with euphony not with any harkat ul ansar comparing waldmarchen immortalize under the billy of chailly and rattle the chailly time is minutes and seconds while the rattle time is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min second singing i of the most beautiful melodies in the definitive repertoire mr hollwegs voice is more or less bum in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is more or less creamy looking more or less the likes of that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very flimsy preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown quantity to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass voice andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a barytone the tenor is robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the next movement in coney klagende consist is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my auricle in the spread out minutes of the chailly and rattle immortalize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording pin clover at while the rattle recording is the spread out minute is recognise by alone flourishes from the timpani drums a unassailable bass voice telephone line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring memorial tablet this third movement of coney klagende consist is recognise by the front of an off breaker point band which is much quieter than the on breaker point orchestra the off breaker point band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off breaker point band is encounter the only other source of euphony is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement besides boast a chorus druthers for the following reasons i have a flimsy preference for the rattle recording of coney klagende consist the rattle recording was immortalize at a higher volume and the memorial tablet and cymbal are more terse and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterize as very more or less muddy besides i have a flimsy preference for robert tears voice over the bum voice of hollweg the following compare coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are let the cat out of the bag by brigitte fassbaender who usage a say vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are let the cat out of the bag by the male person while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from coney knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the angle and i the likes of this i the dear because it is the same tune as that find in the walk in movement in mahlers philharmonic no anyway this compare the angle strain des marcus antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado immortalize celebrated boast of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five spot d equus asinus the likes of bray from clarinet that come about at seconds and again at seconds the nibble concludes with a gloomy volume mysterious looking taiwanese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the angle strain has too much echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are blur because brigitte fassbaender babble at the same set up as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and disruption with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording besides the very ending of the nibble in the chailly recording boast a big gloomy note from a bassoon and to my auricle the mysterious looking taiwanese bell does not occur at the ending of the chailly recording to repeat these points what i the likes of and prefer about the abbado recording is the nippy sound and the more well discernible fluttery flutes equus asinus bray and mysterious taiwanese bell conclusion the chailly recording cater a great excerpt of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphony orchestra a thrifty slope by slope compare of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other immortalize will enable any listener to make up ones mind on a favored recording i did my own slope by slope comparability and discovered that i had a flimsy preference for immortalize under the billy of simon the canaanite rattle and claudio abbado coney klagende consist is my very favorite of mahlers piece and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty eld old
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
