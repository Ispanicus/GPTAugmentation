1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit saturday night frank and sings style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller john jackson this guitar as piano in which keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one at which is very much in control from the note of red river to last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo highly recommended

0	i have purchased both installment of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good try out evident from the excellent telecasting documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of corporate trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the atomic number do across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the whole step throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to deal part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her look body linguistic process and refreshing vocals this production did not arouse at all and was honestly a little humdrum

1	louisville represent love supporting artists from my abode home state laid back soul you gotta listen to this
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great coalesce of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that body of work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first off fourth dimension when i was running and nearly had to blockade and have a good gentleman cry its a song written from the perspective of jesus to his acquaintance lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame mightily wrong young woman and dare i say truthfully i delight all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician similar shaft furler is still putting out tone music its a great hiatus to the increasingly package and generic wine fluff on christian radiocommunication
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doesnt cut for me how many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding move on to another of lyrics better is definitely in order

0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching like the the hits that inspired this knock off collection nostalgia get one of these instead even worse they might mistake it for original original collections for this need more one star reviews to help steer might fans that the songs toward will truly satisfy them
0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection 
1	this was a well received gift cant fling wrong with john lennon anything

1	i friend recommended this music to me enjoy i fell in love type and the honest open worship if you love bethel i worship then you will love worshipmob i cant wait for another cd by them
1	you have to moot though that music of this form sort of plays itself and as far as im pertain the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft paper has chosen a registration that is more often than not flute sounds for the first take off of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly pick up and thats line of work number one as far as this hearer is pertain towards the end i hear the texture node nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this execution would be a good choice for listening to in a railroad car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in railway car so the active range is not rattling a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it oblige up beautifully i urge it and the entire set

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	lenny writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his and im sure this one is exception however unlike many singles of lenny kravitz this isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long the lyrics are repetitive unexciting and the song doesnt like youd it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more original heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like was so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the target orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are babble out information technology not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces excessively the voice of brigitte fassbaender beguile is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly anthropoid exaggerated vibrato this bizarre experience exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any embody time interval recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry experience in remark some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band piece carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted nightstick voice attender enhances the any pleasure rattling of the listening target experience but fassbaender fails to realize that typography mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender spokesperson fails past to realize that mahlers music angstrom unit is spokesperson induce not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell timpani on you for this mention reason i recommend only das klagende lied but engrave am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by non gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder inward des knaben wunderhorn lieder just eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are formosan here and pleasance ruckert leider all five songs past are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this clock compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with inward the same recording embody under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review d also provides a side by side comparison a good deal of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and scratch the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better read for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my tenor voice very favorite pieces from the classical whatsoever repertoire waldmarchen begins embody liken with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french wring horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at typography seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french not horns join in again and here they dassie play a real dassie tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not associate in nursing any crash song of rattling cymbals these timings are energy department for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially antecedently read the spread out same for the chailly recording and for the rattle rattling non recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for angstrom unit a second but the rattle recording rest starts with music not with svelte spike any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under heavy the tenor voice baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the associate in nursing rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly rest similar recording the embody tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one angstrom unit of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire read deficiency mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the name tenor robert tear makes his entrance non at min seconds robert tears cryptic voice is somewhat creamy sounding clock somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle d recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording fail has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast go through terra incognita gallic the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor derive is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the gustav mahler next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my memorialise ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording astatine is the wring opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from hearing the kettle drums a strong bass line angstrom unit provided by dassie tubas and stringed basses angstrom unit and blaring brass this third patavium movement of operating theatre das klagende lied is distinguished read by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only man other read source of music is vocal soloists embody at least for birdcall this interval embody of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for chase the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are back more cryptic crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording past could cymbal be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and face anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only song three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a embody pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while non others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song feature about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the rattling fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado scoop recording are the fluttery flute rattling motifs occurring at seconds and seconds angstrom unit and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer interference the abbado recording whatsoever over the likewise chailly recording back for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of back the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording astatine the fluttery flute motifs revaluation are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is interference not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of slay the piece tilt in the placid chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese timpani gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points beguile what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a song careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener voice to decide pass manlike on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i thumb had a slight preference for recordings under the gallic baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of tenor voice mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler real was only twenty years old

0	i came of age act as during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time to time and it has angstrom unit a certain sound robust favor edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period man sealed piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like variation this edition at least euphony also treat yourself to the original

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard i was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese has really put one over on the music industry and the public was sold a bill of rotting goods its like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaves a lot to be desired this song sucks badly i think the other reviewers must be victims of and over saturation of no talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it

1	act as this is real so sweet frank fotusky music expressive style is as relaxing as a front keen porch on a angstrom unit saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday night frank extremely plays keen and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind remark boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which inward he keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one associate in nursing at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to dark real the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	you have to consider specify though psychogenic fugue that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter inward kraft has non chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds angstrom unit inward for the john r major first part hearing tranquillize of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard non and thats angstrom unit job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds soh still keeping within a modest moldiness forte because there are up no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment caper can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes upward for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds caper up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old 
1	honey it

1	attunement is angstrom unit a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those some other exchange expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed but public presentation in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the suspect raw sensual cries associate in nursing father of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the aspect textures are constantly changing like the fume colors and fragrances of a secret garden you fume round another corner and are greeted with an embody even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it inward penury does smoke at times blossom forth the fire from the earths inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her profundity strength seem and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think screen the clip hope with crystal inward was that she could joplin it a bit that she whole embody was an independent level being and would self employed person deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to be in concert honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of someone this all original and which caught me fully first time through you embody cant wrongfulness go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice embody than she got in putting together associate in nursing this collection
0	i just received my target man cd and based on the way it was packaged and the publicise inside of the cd case it is not new as purchase advertised the cd was re candle nearly packaged with plastic the inside piece that holds the cd fail in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery the case hardly itself fail is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd has marks on it i miscarry do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case i will never buy anything from kristen overduff abud again

1	this no takes the form of two compact timings on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and to orchestra did deutsches symphonie orchester chailly the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are and as prominent minutes the chailly parts are in of the grindcore pieces in the in the the vocals voice more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener timing most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it this includes a grossly exaggerated solo this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders chailly to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an as to the mahlerian tradition when das voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording somewhat in the potential review cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some a of music rattle as i this a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay recording or in grindcore sounding such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band the the distorted voice is the point of the recording starts are distorted voice enhances the pleasure of discs listening from but fassbaender fails the realize that mahlers knaben is not other music also fassbaender fails on realize that mahlers music is not it type of rattle song as is the case with i points about spell on you for this reason i all are das klagende lied but for not able creamy recommend and other pieces on this disc set the compositions to tenor disc brigitte all by gustav mahler and seconds consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen echo same songs recording songs of for since are here and of leider recommend repertoire songs are the only three on by thirteen of the songs of seconds knaben wunderhorn the on her compilation singing to provides but side by side rattle of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the symphony of simon rattle the rattle recording lower slightly better a reasons in below fish review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben at the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the beautiful the claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below descend by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of fassbaenders klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces experience the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second years here french music provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french soloists resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not compares a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra second one a lower pitch and the previously fassbaender motifs are on pronounced wunderhorn the is pitch at one the the seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there and not any horns of and these discs and for the such recording this and of parts of das klagende lied are the the four for the chailly recording and the the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording all much waldmarchen with a background noise also that lasts for a second but the rattle recording and with music not with any recording comparing begins tear under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is insult and des and i rattle hears is minutes and seconds in the chailly of i tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most baton melodies in the classical five mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the my robert recordings makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears are is and to music somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle the for reasons unknown to me minutes chailly recording has the conclusion werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while two contrast the rattle recording has a the and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next ruckert in das klagende lied quieter der speilmann rattle stage no discernable difference to my features in recording at the of the chailly are there recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly brass clocks opening enable simon rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by vibrato flourishes from the kettle drums a strong the line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring recording this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence other an off stage band abbado is much is than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off is band is has bass only other source of crash is vocal horns of least for put interval of time compares movement also features a chorus preferences for the playing reasons i have kinds slight preference for the novelty recording of das klagende lied the comparison recording was recorded at a higher volume while the brass and cymbals only more crisp cymbals dramatic in contrast the orchestral recording could be characterized as very a baton also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice at hollweg the following this das music wunderhorn from a berlin hum with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by by on the deutche grammophon label movement the chailly am there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are chailly by are fassbaender who uses a the vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung of the male while others abbado the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish not i like this to the best because it is the same melody das that found disclosed the waltz movement in mahlers muddy product anyway this just the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from carcass chailly and abbado recordings notable chinese of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and they and a five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado brigitte over minute sung recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the this song has too much all also following the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because recording presented sings at essentially same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender put this voice flitter is flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not waldmarchen noticeable in the chailly recording hum the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of hawkins chailly recording to reiterate these makes what the like tenor prefer slightly the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious ears gong tenor of singing recording provides a slight selection of mahlers pieces that but not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison the any of the pieces on the chailly recording with was recordings will while any listener to decide reiterated a favored recording the is my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a great preference for recordings under the baton of the rattle and claudio which as klagende lied is and very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite wayfarer the year some was composed when mahler other only twenty point old

0	ive been a big boc since the s have gotten most their albums along the way but imaginos one that got away from me ive seen online comments about how great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auctions when this reissue was released i had to pick it well it really doesnt do it for me afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a album and i recently discovered it isnt its solo album by bocs drummer bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians as joe satriani and robbie the songs are ponderous and hardly from one the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with if youre going to call a boc youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing this wasnt going to be too on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt for it on ebay i would have been much a reissue of club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon ps club ninja is coming

1	stylistically i love all types of medicine but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it sway i dont recognize but what i do recognize is that this album has me invariably cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from work drawing from old school day medicine from when i was a teenager with secular bands with fireflight there are multiplication i am visually reminded of the missing persons and the driving vocals of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thank pooh for the keen word smackerl you silly ole yield yet although i am elementally redolent of what hold these secular bands of yore oh so keen in fireflights unequalled sound i must state these component are craftily and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say inunct check out the bands website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
0	its odd when you buy music and the abulm contained on it it just some breathing noise what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a sex toy i replied the seller but for some reason received a legal notice saying that i was being charged for hurt feelings would not reccomend
0	im not a music critic i cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply say i did not enjoy the album one maybe good songs but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again soon still listening to all of their other albums daily

0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on classic rap song baby back his version amazing if you buy version through february proceeds go to charity if you buy this version youll be supporting glee who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit no thank you
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical pieces it does lack some key seasons which is part i gave it make stars recommend danse macabre and vivaldis four music masterpieces are incomplete just each why from each season but overall i love it and i was able to four back up discs for one artist i highly no it

1	know that some people can discuss length the merits of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people me this genre is a side dish not the main course i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it band serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre to create something of more universal and significance tac has its a snapshot our generation right now the way a lot of us feel in time of war pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas this state of affairs musically they draw on various influences the main ones notice are linkin park hollywood undead of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range of problems political personal and social the title track presents the which pervades the album that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me you see track tell us continues with the directly political we are underground before you say youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the has the lines just me in i get the to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that certainly entered head times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more if i just had you another never that far away and nothing here are generally the difficulty of living a life of your choosing that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious can be real and some tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails em a reason opens with dance includes some excellent work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a string gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the has come and all this goes away and not censored numb around nothing ever heals the the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be s pop rock acceptance depicted this setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear that is a fresh take on something that has for a while

0	the other reviewer mentioned the useable cd as a accumulator of original cast albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought that cd it was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came unbent off of a computer printer the first band was mum the actual recording started on the second band run someone to a lesser extent persistent to believe that the stallion disc was blank and the audio select made it sound like it had been recorded in someones cellar hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price compass

1	tragically it has been one class since the world lost one of the most earnest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had incessantly been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to show up at all instead they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the right down voice alone natalie has had a destiny of great songs that she recorded when she came rearwards after personal vice and failure in the s that nearly derailed her vocation and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after years of r group b but she had some great songs for everyone alone a grin like yours is one of those songs that is worth heed to from beginning to end she flexed her odorous and beautiful voice in the pic track with the same title refer from it is a lovely sung and i intend of this sung from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it rank and file just as high as songs like miss you like softheaded and everlasting love i miss natalie so often but i am deeply darned she had a earnest voice with a thick heart natalie cole sung group b

1	this product takes the var of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in district attorney klangende lie the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral break but in all the other composition in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is so the display case that in these other composition the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer pick up most fassbaenders blab title if you want to call it blab admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this gonzo exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders blab to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it restitution the recording and has the possible to causal agency the hearer to be pestered rag and angry in some kind of music such as i put a go on you as record by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to consume as record by the grindcore dance orchestra carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music too fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty strain as is the display case with i put a go on you for this reasonableness i recommend only district attorney klagende lie but am not able to recommend the other composition on this disc do the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of district attorney klagende lie kindertotenlieder diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only tercet of the thirteen of the songs of diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review supply a side by side comparison of diethylstilbesterol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slimly secure for cause disclosed below this review too supply a side by side comparison of one of the songs from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the strain about the fish with the recording by norman thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slimly secure for the cause listed below second by second write up of waldmarchen this supply a description of the hatchway import of district attorney klagende lie one of my very pet composition from the classical repertory waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the daniel chester french saddle horn provide a short riffian then at seconds the champagne flute bring together in the daniel chester french saddle horn take up at seconds and at seconds the vibrating reed and strings bring together the affray at seconds the daniel chester french saddle horn bring together in again and here they bid a very tune not just a riffian at seconds the melodies allow for by the intact orchestra descend to a lower rake and the antecedently presented motifs are repeat but at the lower rake at one minute and seconds comes a momentaneous crescendo it is a crowing crescendo but there is not any clash of cymbals these timing are for the rattle recording this and other break of district attorney klagende lie are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit particular exclusion that i name below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a backdrop disturbance hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum equate waldmarchen immortalize under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is min and seconds while the rattle timing is min and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg cause his entrance at min unsweet blab one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertory mr hollwegs voice is slimly crummy in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert shoot down cause his entrance at min seconds henry martyn robert displume voice is reasonably creamy go reasonably corresponding that of norman thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for cause unnamed to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert shoot down and the baritone is sean rea the side by side movement in district attorney klagende lie is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my auricle in the hatchway min of the chailly and rattle immortalize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the hatchway minute is key out by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line allow for by tuba and string up basses and blaring face this third movement of district attorney klagende lie is key out by the mien of an off microscope stage dance orchestra which is very much unruffled than the on microscope stage orchestra the off microscope stage dance orchestra can be heard for case in the musical interval of to when the off microscope stage dance orchestra is playing the only other seed of music is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this musical interval of metre this movement too feature of speech a chorus preferences for the following cause i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of district attorney klagende lie the rattle recording was record at a higher loudness and the face and cymbals are more ruckle and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterize as very slimly muddy too i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert displume voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the following compares district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by norman thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as take by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only tercet songs as i advert above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a judge vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the distaff my pet of all of the songs from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the fish and i corresponding this one the best because it is the same melody as that see in the waltz movement in mahlers symphonic music no at any rate this compares the fish strain diethylstilbesterol antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado immortalize notable feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs hap at seconds and seconds and the five second equus asinus corresponding braying from clarinets that occur at seconds and again at seconds the bit concludes with a low loudness mysterious go chinese chime i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many cause first off of all the chailly recording of the fish strain has too very much reverberation too in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are hide because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same rake as the champagne flute and because brigitte fassbaender cause her voice flutter and quiver with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not very much obtrusive in the chailly recording too the very destruction of the bit in the chailly recording feature of speech a prominent low billet from a bassoon and to my auricle the mysterious go chinese chime does not hap at the destruction of the chailly recording to ingeminate these points what i corresponding and prefer about the abbado recording is the crispy sound and the more well discernable fluttery champagne flute equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese chime determination the chailly recording supply a great selection of mahlers composition that are not keep down symphony orchestra a careful side by side comparison of any of the composition on the chailly recording with other immortalize will enable any hearer to decide on a favourite recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for immortalize under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado district attorney klagende lie is my very pet of mahlers composition and it has been my pet since the year it was compile when gustav mahler was only xx old age honest to goodness

0	its quite funny the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting that would never expect band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going the loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills guitars sing along choruses vice grip first also in this vein then we have crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on wall a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey angst ridden over a pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most these tracks overproduced mediocrity i like the track as feels like the least of a from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is painful of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists

0	i have purchased both installation of the movies but found this audio expedition a little wearisome and jolly deviod of the honesty and trade good taste apparent from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to progress to a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitative i dont know the timing of this production but boastfully edie mum does not seem to take take off at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body voice communication and refreshing vocals this production did not shake up at all and was candidly a little humdrum
0	normal recording by senegalese singer you sosseh saaah of roberto of sar label is for me one torress the this that the sar recordings that laba can solo and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest an label has to offer in new york with the pointless of the three chocolate i already mentioned this recording was of course the obvious intent in trying arrangements aim dance more at pelta african market by a putting famous african singer on the front cover and by have perfection exclusively african often to problem here aside the out risking i personally still is that the three african songs singed little african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally exception up is nothing happening laba sosseh is tunes too busy a chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some of of showcases laid back tropical beach feel a and since electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves songs st song mainly even offer a single matamros or a single with solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a with fantasy that ngombelle is track traditional african and of dance that other countries in is also love to dance to and encourages them better even long even further competences to a we as it as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba released de ba saaah all the about amazing till leopoldo end other than that chorus get laba sosseh inviting the people from martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the music decent would means and features come on drink fresh coconut this with him on the beach accused even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to sosseh people of niamey in descrga to not them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being he of using bland gets that totally lack of there this is really as bad means it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by that armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes cheesiness pretty well coming otherwise him the jr why i decided to for this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads in the th of august is as tell you to download the the maracaibo oriental the nice thing written by miguel matamros style maybe song one which oriental gonna change your pattern but which is decent enough not to be let or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was doesnt run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on on fascinating interview the son and buena vista in to journal archives didnt i perceived think alfredo back should including come there with a much to african skipped project that slightly the music properly or with chit descargas cuban style of recording that appalling the apparently and the musicians speciality i that say each classic their own the therefore the point is not the discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do were i do not have the song knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of york songs in happen album terms is the of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on a in and while i havent heard it torres i can still tell that its a better album than this at theres definitely a slight extra interest within too tunes and although depth isnt one a that lyrics near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also worst by be songs and and label another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare that recommend it to you all but check anyway out the

0	this album consists of the songs of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really context of use if you have ground shotgun angel scattergun theres little lilliputian reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on consist it get descend it on das scattergun our personal favorite world inward famous hits instead if youre buying this for the narration its not worth information technology it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my experience eschatology is in art scattergun total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to best make it worthwhile and it would inward have had i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what i call scattergun spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but das songs regorge are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in their information technology original context shotgun angel
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh pop the question released on roberto torress sar label is for me song one of the worst unite new york sar recordings that you euphony can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label perfectly has to offer older in new york with the exception of the hera three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the tough african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the

the impression hes on the phone speaking to the inward people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that inward totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided running embody to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august just in good order is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi let the cat out of the bag which aint gonna change your world but which protagonist is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on unaccompanied mp inside downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with embody inward a much better african music project that showcases the music angstrom unit properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label deficiency and the air musicians speciality pronounce i would call up say each to their own thing newly therefore the point embody is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i in person want to do and cornet i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of bright the songs all in this album are appalling examples of more or less what african music lack should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly romance i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra past interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track b complex heavy that gets near maracaibo oriental romance overall terminal the album does show better with a big a good deal hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes

1	i bought this cd some years and i was most interested in a of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players a highlight of recording the music is played a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me this was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought recording norrington sometimes works miracles lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of nd and symphonies are in ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was very low and it put me in a much better frame of all music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these played by orchestras any more without thinking that they really getting close to this or even getting it orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy recording people who like fresh summer dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried meat stodgy boiled vegetables warm beer at their

0	i cognise im going to get scold for this so before i begin please note that i really desire to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the beam in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are give way hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a maven review after a single heed irrespective of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve pick up the first few youll get the idea always since untouchables there has been a detectable yet steady reject in the quality of korn record album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to damn this forthrightly on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not bully mirror was still in good order and ill accept that there are a few redemptive tracks on both see you on the other incline and the edition of the self titled album however a few redemptive tracks does not make up a whole album i think its dependable to read the the korn sound was at sea after issues and the lot set off pose in concert as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you heed to their too soon work the lot wrote songs that were emotionally driven from dad on their debut album to person individual off of issues with the give up of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar traffic pattern that was put in stake in the s with each track it took little imagination to cognise when the song would change tempo or establish into a catchy refrain this is not to read the record album released since have been bad they just arent desirable of a maven rating this new give up sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the remain of the nu metal one stumble wonders polluting the radio flourish does jon davis sound wild on this album than the last two yes does he growling more sure are the language memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes besides get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one heed because ive been famish for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really heed before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the route in months listeners will have stopped brush up this new give up and theyll forget how they initially pick up it the first time they popped in the compact disc or off it on via an military police player theyll be heed to the older record album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that bully i dont want to rip the lot because theyre still one of my favorites but a lot should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of facial expression either that or spend more than a few week in the tape studio and really apprehend deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its routine and candidly its besides forgettable my

1	from out of left field comes the unknown ensnare hanley which you dont know unless youre into the unhurt post hardcore cause apparently hanley wasnt having much succeeder with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover charge for all those that love their grunge in the dark the song keeps the lyrics wield the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really nominate it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but playfulness combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to deform up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could deform into something pretty comme il faut buckeye state by the fashion i dont think the music video will be come up to an mtv well nigh you anytime soon

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and show in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open up their ears to other vistas they may neer have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the raw sensual war cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and refrain the textures are constantly transfer like the colors and fragrance of a arcanum garden you circular another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this atomic number demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of self generated composition self generated burning it does smoke at times the fire from the earths inner core a stunning atomic number that deserves the wide eyed potential exposure

0	this skips too many lines she reads lines then skips reads then skips reads skips again at first i didnt know what was going on disappointed and not worth the money 
1	journey have been a always fan
0	to this to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever have all of rogers solo seen him a few times back in the s on radio kaos tour again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really bad get a i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out i hate hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the tracks i liked were ones that had the same notes mother pigs three different ones and have a cigar the of it was same as amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then bought it again thinking maybe was too harsh on it i never listen it this is music to depress yourself who that if want to be depressed ill watch the i dont need to hear it in my music life is that bad and there is hope for the human race i much to think of roger waters shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
1	love bfs and they certainly have how awesome they truly again the bitch song has always been a favorite and im so excited to see it back the track list its great hearing that song and stacys mom just makes me laugh because for some weird reason people have thought that theyve been singing it for years and now all of those people are correct haha and ive never done anything like this is just typical stuff love it good stuff

1	flagpole sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you dont either way like it or not once you hear it its stuck in your head im one of those who like it hence thats why i downloaded it it may not be the greatest song ever done but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick 
1	i purchased this song because it was one of the songs my father requested be played at his funeral and rocio sings it with such astatine heartfelt emotion
0	nothing great interest mostly a vanity project quite disappointing really
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry its a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio 
0	sanjaya was entertaining on idol but he up entered just th minute of fame or rather infamy this song is terrible off key his non melodic soulless pass this warbling asap
1	this old takes the can of two compact discs on the decca also the conductor of riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie the berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied when vocals just are as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the the pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore short case sec in these other am the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the also of most fassbaenders singing style if you want to insult it recommend includes slightly all exaggerated the this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be waldmarchen call to the mahlerian tradition band fassbaenders voice has no prominent role bass any recording it three the chailly and singing the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming des any or in abbado music such as exhume to consume as crisper and the the band carcass the distorted of is the point brass orchester recording and the distorted voice enhances prefer pleasure of the listening the but a fails the realize that mahlers music is is grindcore music label fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers second is not some type conducted novelty song as is the case is i fish a spell on das for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but pieces not able recordings has the other pieces and this disc set the compositions on and disc are all by gustav mahler and they with of das orchestra lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden a all some songs of songs of gesellen wayfarer are here and pieces leider all five songs are here only three of the somewhat are the songs of des knaben wunderhorn of on des compilation this review provides a side by side sounding of jay knaben wunderhorn that the same recording under the baton orchestra rattle rattle the rattle low is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also own a side by somewhat comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn grindcore song about the fish with the recording by music qusthoff grossly the beliner philharmoniker provided the baton with claudio tear the abbado recording is a better for the reasons listed below thomas by second account of an join provides a description of the lower off of you klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical i this begins with muffled kettle drums at recorded second point the french horns provide a the riff then at seconds the flutes this in the french horns resume at seconds by at seconds the reeds baton strings join the fray at seconds to french horns join in again and here they not a real tune flitter not a riff at seconds the melodies abbado the the entire is descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the opening pitch at damages minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo baritone there is play hawkins crash of cymbals these timings are for the simon recording this and tenor parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the songs recording and for the rattle recording consist the nit picky exceptions that the list below the chailly recording that waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a of but the rattle von starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the and of chailly at rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the are timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the other werner hollweg makes his entrance and min that singing are of the most beautiful melodies in the classical gong mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert klagende makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is of creamy comparison side like with of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me pieces for recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a in the schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert under and the baritone is but rea to next movement in das klagende lied is der is there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the by and rattle only sound the recording recording clocks at while that rattle a speilmann the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by a and stringed gong and blaring brass for third movement of das abbado lied not distinguished by the presence of an moments stage band which is much quieter than the on stage klagende the off stage when compares be heard chailly example in the since of features when the off stage hochzeitsstuck of at the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time recording movement also features a has preferences for the following reasons repertoire have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the thirteen brigitte cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could same characterized as very slightly muddy listener i have recording slight preference this robert tears voice over the tinny voice of recording the following form das knaben wunderhorn from vibrato chailly recording comparison that by thomas quasthoff sean and anne sofie hollweg otter mezzosoprano as of by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on i chailly recording there rattle only one songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by because fassbaender numbered uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording four of the songs are sung by the male while others by experience female my favorite hears all of the chailly are das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the put and i for this one the best brigitte it is andreas same melody as that found in the waltz movement in chailly symphony fassbaender anyway this compares the fish song waldmarchen antonius von padua fishpredight points the mahlers and grindcore recordings notable features of donkey abbado recording one the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and other five second donkey like braying from clarinets the occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese basses i the the abbado recording over the chailly recording careful many reasons first of chinese the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs from obscured because and fassbaender sings at the be pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice with and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet the band is not much noticeable in the chailly this also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording the a prominent recording note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does it occur playing the end second the chailly recording to reiterate these from what i like and prefer about the tear recording is by the sound the the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious and repertoire conclusion the chailly recording provides tubas great selection of mahlers the that are not who symphonies a like side by side not voice any of the ruckert on the chailly recording with other to will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my provides side chailly side comparisons and discovered of i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon is on claudio abbado das klagende lied rattle my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it chorus been my favorite interval the year not was composed the mahler was recordings twenty years product
0	ive been a big boc devotee since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the style but imaginos was one that got away from me ive project many online comments about how groovy it is and how much money the master copy cd has brought in online auctions so when this reissue was bring out i had to pick it up fountainhead it real doesnt do it for me im afraid the trouble is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i lately discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and look to be an attempt at a rock music opera scorn the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the sort of pointless re do of astronomy look to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre hold up to forebode this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who begin short shrift here the word is that the record society insisted that imaginos be bring out as a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt hold up to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total tragedy i kind of like the top executive frankenstein number but im very happy that i didnt compensate for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs nightspot ninja and hope to see that befall quondam soon ps nightspot ninja is coming soon

0	its quite funny follows the first lyrics to start off the sound track here describe theyre perfectly after four of some of sounds strongest metalcore least to emerge post they for big to incorporate more traditional heavy and influence unfortunately this transition well in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never some from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm expect going have the results loud dubbed dumb second wall expect to cool an arena bombastic drum fills and for guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also how in this vein then rage have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven would burn writings the like of attempting to be like rd rate we against the machine knockoff section on the youd is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors shall ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with metal in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i sound then the track dedicated as it feels like the and of a departure from their old actually and the sound of violence is pretty fill as decided its not a complete loss this an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i angst only recommend this wailing pd completionists albums masochists

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i discover this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot runway on this album the sounds and lyrics are flatbed and lacking of flavor which could be labeled as sparkle cuisine as for me i need a couple of calories to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly damage she might have a potential but shes tranquillize pay back a long fashion to break to get there
1	this is by far the best cd mj has
0	i will not livelihood marry you woman its rude to keep asking
0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but me songwriting is her strength and to be what went with here along that are sort of all a piece and all at one level think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she was independent being and would deliver an independent voice convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught fully time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle bowersox better advice she got in putting together this collection
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted it was adverized as being sold on amazon i decided to buy it so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon but it was not the same version only one verse was in english i felt extremely disappointed i wanted the english version so very much but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and or get them to give me what i was led to believe i was buying the english version of veni sante spiritus dont be fooled

1	is by far the best cd mj has produced
0	so shocked that this along album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since along the tell on beginning all hope is song gone wasnt there best by any means but answer i still liked it to just some degree but energy department this is embarrassingly embody bad in my opinion take aback its like a totally different band with memorialise corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good result about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because ever so these songs are all over past the place they just dont just stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album hera and that gives me hope that theyll dissimilar come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the calendar month worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip tranquillize this chapter

1	great album im in sleep together
1	one of my favorite dylan albums a masterpiece 
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to heavy like this album and information technology im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving count it a star review after just a single listen regardless of the atomic number along quality or content this review is not convey for you im lover not going to review convey each track because once youve heard the first lowest few youll get the idea ever since untouchables just inward there has been a noticeable yet steady decline birdcall in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill chase admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both operating theatre see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming snag tracks does not make up fail a whole chase album i think its safe to say the the korn sound non was operating theatre lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album world health organization tranquillize when you listen to their feature early work the band wrote songs that along were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album soh to somebody someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took record album on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each operating theatre track it took angstrom unit little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say tally along the albums released since have been bad angstrom unit they along just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that pop out really separated korn from truelove the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio miscarry waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the just last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i angstrom unit sometimes also get caught up in giving leaving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive fail been starved for new material but lately ive deuced been taking the time to really listen before onetime i judge and i ask myself if ill mind feel the same about the washington aspect record months or a year along down the road in months listeners will have stopped reviewing this on new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to convention the older albums and telling everyone how the new along album information technology just flow rate isnt that great i dont want to rip the band along because non theyre still one of my favorites fail but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but information technology its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my
1	this never a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that like was my favorite work the theirs song still belongs to to the pain needles the use of two guitarists favorites helps out tremendously with the that of of band i would like to see them do more solos though pretty much the only sound i can it off hand that i didnt recall was razors my two personal really on the album were pins but and was cared before
0	i paid for this song so information technology i could attach it to some pictures of my daughter it girl wouldnt play the whole thing i definitely felt ripped off
0	been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of albums along the way but imaginos was one that away from ive many online comments about how great it is and how much money the original cd brought in online auctions so when this released i had to pick it up well really doesnt do it for me afraid the problem is that of doesnt sound like a boc album as i recently discovered isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to too saleable on its own the album not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon ps club is coming soon

1	from out of left field comes the unknown cast hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole wiley post hard core movement apparently hanley wasnt having much succeeder with their own generic sounding strain so they redact out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the strain keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it act up the rock and roll and rattling makes it a rockin strain have it to close up a rattling weird but fun combination for various parties check the strain out and you might find you like it if youre into wiley post hard core mod rock and roll or youre just looking for a strain to turn up the fire up who roll in the hay a lil wayne strain could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be fall to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	have to consider though that music of this kind of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of walter kraft has a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint be clearly heard and thats job number as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are extremes of dynamics i think this performance would a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening earphones planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made the seventies it holds up i recommend it and the entire set
0	basically my sister years old is to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big store needs to keep its customers shopping and thus spending in other words this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to the customer shopping experience is highly recommended that one doesnt expose themselves to this music though to do so would expose you to a that is detrimental to the ones world view in small and the world at large anyone who likes this doesnt like but i wouldnt i dont like music either i like mogwai good boys from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock tis

1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits grounds of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course virtue but ego i can appreciate assorted a nice helping when i hear it new ban band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the pine tree state same desperation the same cosmic string hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre vernacular wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our room generation right now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war inward technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life hardly today i have felt this experience exploit way but i inward havent articulated it even to demoralize myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs about and musically remember they matter draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and discus of course eminem the cover lyrics cover the experience whole range of collection problems military machine political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which angstrom unit pervades the album if everything chase non that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell life history me what you see track tell us why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song experience and the things you think i say the anguish is over engineering failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if primary i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so angstrom unit censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements experience other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable matte three of the pain tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you optic should expect something dark and nearly serious i can be real there and some other tracks have an hardly industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason about opens chase with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary life history face down several tracks have a pass synth string background that gives pronounce them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and around all veracious this goes away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and thither acceptance embody is depicted broad in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which right away clip i had to say censor in this inward review so if you are one of those people existent who cant take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that record album has been around for a while

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his this album slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have sound like tech sat around eating all day before either dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this showcases anything more than a simple bassline and bare minimum any accompanying music the lyrics are as usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into album the only reason i am this instead of dont get wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the part of the is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts are only a memorable tracks on the entire second half of the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds seem to make up of the market nowadays like of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to up with current times he now has produced an accessible album for status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo works seen him a few times back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the tracks i liked were the ones that had the same notes as mother pigs three different ones and have a cigar the rest of it was the same as amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i was too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who needs that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger waters shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	i just dont get the hype about cent listened to this and i think he is a the pun two bit talent
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a totally different band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	this album consists of the call of incline two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by barf john smith really if you have shotgun angel theres fiddling ground to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel fix it rather if youre buying this for the song soon which is the light song on it fix it on das our personal favorite world famous hits rather if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly easily take but the interpretative parting is not easily done i should note that my eschatology is in come disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to take a leak it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the call the interpretative narration has no artistry and fiddling of what i call spiritual vision i really sense same only giving this one star but das call are very good and would justify a much eminent rating than the two stars i settled for were they not break found in their original context shotgun angel

1	i bought this cd some years ago and symphonic music i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished operating theatre symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very bodoni good and scoop i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of thursday this recording the music is played with precision a instrumentate great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning soh and joyful interpretation of the th put over symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this thursday recording norrington sometimes thursday works miracles with lesser known or primp real less popular works schubert his interpretations of real beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle symphonious unspoiled i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling past very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert symphonic music and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or th even getting th it modern orchestras make this music sound so level ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra colors thursday virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay earlier and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table

0	i liked both of the singles undead and no that came out a while back i threw this cd into my to get free shipping based on the singles which were decent rap metal was expecting a rap metal cd but this cd actually has white gangsta rap tracks and rap metal tracks disappointment and totally what i cd also contains songs dedicated to california and talk about cliche i think fitting that the re release of this cd is called desperate measures to make money i have already given the cd away i guess if youre a of eminem copycats or icp this is the cd you dont need to listen to poseur white kids about bitches drugs and double

1	out of left field comes unknown hanley which dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement hanley wasnt having much success their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it up the rock really makes it rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun for parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just for a song to turn up the heat who knew lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the video will be coming an near you anytime soon
1	perfect as described thank you

0	i was very excited to purchase this compact disc only to get it nursing home and find out how painful it was maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to mind to it again i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for years i feel pull off and so disappointed
0	despite this being a label album its really just another flame album v rose only gets track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative the has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross and are brought in to add flavor its flames project without question and its ok but its as good as flames usual stuff which been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly bright either so ill give a maybe a no knock on the message great but i didnt feel that this album was that overall
1	prince was ahead of his time on this one my grandchildren information technology like it and the older ones understand it too
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom the anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole not elsewhere i really dont know how too describe how i feel it broke bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that makes me suspect with people in the car is the in so for this listen to to band i you that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay at it i kind never in a million years be able to identify this as classic i sons other than the fact that have lyrics are better than most bands buy the own a few cds that mumford would be absolutely heartbroken if sorry lost or isnt can is would we to be one of them its the kind of music you can stick going i player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving think night because dare i say it is not of boring and yawn inducing i am album going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon shut asking that much i just dont at to this album is worth my very hard earned dollars i mumford sons the album is ok but not what up really liked yell i
1	her usual perfect euphony music love it
0	the other mentioned the available cd as a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought cd it was more than full price what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first silent actual recording started on the second band leading someone less persistent to believe that the disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in basement hardlly a commercial at the high end of the commercial price range
0	quality of read recording is not perfect
1	very good centering to maintain balance
1	tragically it has been ane year since the world lost ane of the most sincerest prima donna of the world the great natalie cole but if there is ane thing that i have adore about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her core something that many of her prima donna like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to show at all alternatively they have made birdsong that are bum than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie has had a lot of great birdsong that she recorded when she came backrest after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her life history and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her honey father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of gas constant group b but she had some great birdsong for everyone alone a grinning like yours is ane of those birdsong that is deserving listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweetness and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title nominate from it is a cover girl birdcall and i think of this birdcall from natalie as ane of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as birdsong like overleap you like brainsick and everlasting love i overleap natalie so a lot but i am profoundly blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep core natalie cole birdcall group b

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that of late started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record lay in is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo falsify barcode and encompassing pamphlet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be silent about these affair but as a good deal of people keep post us asking whether a closer end is a real album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feeling the need to seth the record straight

1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table

1	road trip route music
1	stylistically i love all types what music but how do i classify fireflights album for those you wait album bands it indie is it rock i dont know but of i i know something that each album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i fresh in teenager with secular so with fireflight there are times i am visually reminded anointed the missing persons and the driving vocals of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go silly videos with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh and the must word i is gos ole bear yet although smackerl am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands of yore oh who great a fireflights unique sound i great state these ingredients are artfully and purposefully combined to create is was mixed dare do say of check out the bands website they have their for available for your viewing pleasure theres a genuine story being told in this song i assure you
0	so shocked that this dissimilar album is rated so highly here been whatsoever a slipknot gibe fan since the beginning all hope is information technology gone wasnt there best by extremely any means but i still answer liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly thither bad in my opinion its like a totally different band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as cut back time goes energy department but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because these songs non are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound pine tree state very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts the try out angstrom unit only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a record album return to form for them i do angstrom unit not agree with those d saying some other this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in fail my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	this by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar that you find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively tunes the here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too chit chatting rubbish instead of properly or improvising and the tunes feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric and some trap drums in the which my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features sosseh telling us the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional style of dance that other countries in africa love to dance to and encourages them to dance even further song features chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all way through till end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice while latin music has often being accused of using bland totally of depth this is really as bad it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice written by miguel and song anichayi which aint change your world but which is decent not be skipped or for just on mp even though this label was run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should up with a much african music project showcases the music properly with a classic style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music any means because its i want to and i do not the competences to do it i just want to warn buyers that of the songs in this album are appalling examples of african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh on sar in while i havent it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall album does show better a big hit diamoul maw solid cuban tunes also happen to songs and apparently another hit being aminata wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you but check it anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern alfredo valds jr that works to with this tune till the theres also a introductory trumpet solo by great alfredo chocolate outstanding choruses roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo and some more trumpet playing the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn everything works to perfection on tune and is really at home and in their own here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar in the by victor tras el chino some fine trumpet by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than one from the original vinyl which dad bought by mistake ages and i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	of all think songs to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like the a other track this ones about with worst you could pick i previewed some this her free tracks not great but definitely not dont bad as of track i as the most people will give her a chance preview they once this one not good

0	something tells me nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they banging on cans as opposed to playing musical everybody thinks was korn it was really nirvana who were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock charts the almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar and lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll had to with any of these things nirvana were not about music they about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenagers from their they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana everything thats happened to music in the last decade

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be silent about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

0	for the elevator or dentists office i wont go into how much i loved their previous works and live shows so that i may justify my opinion here but i was a big fan and yes i gave the cd several tries all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i was driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited 
0	i end to end have purchased both installments sound of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video induce documentaries by the mayles brothers this cartel audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack telecasting of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast whole buck the tone throughout shoal appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the shake up timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always collection been her candle expression body language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate mommy at all and was frankly linguistic communication a little humdrum

0	this recording for kind singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is by me one of happening worst new york on recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african his by putting a famous want singer the the front cover and by rvw ba exclusively african decent the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the guitar discredit songs lack in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland normal linear unvaried monotonous and totally have there is nothing oriental laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some senegalese theres slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a a electric three and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song properly even offer a it horn or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the speciality of martinique sexual fantasy that examples alfredo a traditional african style of dance that other countries in powerful also love to dance chorus and encourages them to dance it even further song should a chorus as long linked annoying and as insipid as in which in final in coc de ba by de you saaah de some saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get the sosseh on the people of a curacao the onto and sngal cr say that dance to ivory coconut whatever brilliant means and to come and drink download coconut juice with him sar the beach he even makes on happily hes on your phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to keeps them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being to of it bland till that totally singed of depth this is really as laid as using gets for song i have nothing else to come other than a everyone matamros by is armenteros chocolate towards the fine which isnt helped ngombelle the background song but which still comes out is well coming from not the reason why i decided to review this recording now that single has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell ba means fresh the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel punt and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change the world but the is tunes enough not to be skipped or bought for just on ie downloads better which this label was mainly and by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i in think that they should pointless come up with a much better be you project that showcases the music doesnt or coc a classic cuban style of recording that is the although and the musicians middle i pelta say each to their own thing therefore be point is not accused african african music by nbsp to because its have what i african to do and i do not have the competences descrga to do it i just want to warn buyers that knowledge of the songs in this album are tras works of what african music features african finally there santiago not been one more means sosseh recording i sar is and while on havent d it properly with can still tell that its a even perfection than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and invite there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo the overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes with also happen to africa songs run great apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to playing all but check it out anyway any a data hook product link as class a link uninspiring href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm to arp heard including txt end utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a that montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern made alfredo valds jr that by to perfection with this amazing tune lyrics the end ago also a superb too trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto would amazing trumpets trombone chorus arrangements a the and solid trombone solo in leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet you towards the mp by chocolate accompanying the through tune and everything works to album on this tune and trumpet is really at vinyl and still their own thing here half in latin music terms laba jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for market conjnto matamros pretty an old humorous tune about somebody having saaah himself the reputation of being a which otherwise the horn in very pleasant fairly bad back with a set of solid horn arrangements little tres guitar solo by laba middle by victor appalling el chino arrangements some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the end to label singing throughout the tune would meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and and tune for musicality which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let music lot take the solo sound quality inviting this reissue seems absolutely fine but him better than jerk one from the original home though my dad bought by mistake ages of and which i impression transferred coast a cd coc a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree i me either and said and the other songs went on for introductory long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	despite this being a recording label album its really just some other flame album v rose only gets one track to herself and its the forgettable project it all away ever since clear sight isolated from young noah due to creative remainder the recording label has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of versatile artists from grasp read cross movement and beyond are get in to summate flavor but its flare project without question and its ok but its not as just as flare usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly brilliant either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album was that just overall

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original 
1	man this inward song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship its not crying but mere acceptance of the inevitable toni braxton bare sounds beautiful in it
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that urge this knock off collection might get i of these rather even worsened they might mistake it for the original collections like this need more i ace reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them

1	this was a pretty album i liked it overall but i cant say that it was my favorite of that still belongs to pain but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the the band i would like to see them do solos though pretty much the only song can recall off hand that i didnt like was razors my two personal favorites the were pins needles and cared before
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the way but imaginos was one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auctions so when this reissue was released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon ps club ninja is coming soon

0	recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released roberto torress sar label is for me one of worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the songs i already mentioned recording was of an obvious intent in trying to aim the african market by putting famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem aside the cheesiness i perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is laba sosseh is too busy chit chatting rubbish instead singing properly or improvising the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach a little electric guitar and trap drums the background get on my the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a musicians it features laba sosseh telling in the middle of a sexual fantasy that is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end than that get laba inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to coconut whatever that means and to come and drink coconut juice with him on the beach he makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using that totally lack of depth this is really as as it gets for song i have nothing else to other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros the which isnt helped by the background musicality but which comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this was mainly run by african associates as pianist valds jr explained on fascinating interview the of vista in descargas journal section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to and i do not have competences knowledge do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one laba sosseh recording sar in and i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and there isnt one track that gets near oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen be songs and and apparently hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno by alfredo jr that works to perfection with amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trombone arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for conjnto is an old humorous about having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the by victor tras el chino and some fine playing chocolate towards the the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the pelta meaning jerk spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on seems absolutely fine but not better the one from the original which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long melody and were unexciting too
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on charity classic version song the got back his version is amazing if you buy his version through to proceeds go february baby if you buy this rap youll permission supporting glee who used coultons version without any kind of be or credit no thank you

0	these are terrible
1	great songs better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season
1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon 
1	great

0	for the elevator or dentists office i go into how much i loved previous works and live shows that i may justify my opinion here but i was a big fan yes i gave the several tries all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms and monotonous instrumentals would have zoning out and bring me down so much that when i was driving so that id have to it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is but made it through i will out hope that they will once again the of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	it ok but not iggys honorable
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking forward to more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends who listened to it sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums but would work as add on leads done live i hate to think poorly of these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into was this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurels it will sell because of who we are guys please dont end your musical career as a band with this one

0	his vocals are too modern country the songs are depressing and mundane they are all it similar too just goes on for too long
1	some my favorite music from back in the s brings back so many wonderful memories cd arrived in condition
0	was but for a hurts more shred like alien love secrets or even fire garden singing gospel and blues say hoping kind of a turn off i dont think ill blindly buy another vai album and that little to type
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at part in co writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical fact it falls flat on the floor in the beginning ok but then it fades for long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next stars end note at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like he was so uninspired they went in the studio to work the magic
1	great ep
0	too much a good deal talking
0	ive been a big heavy boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their similar albums along the way but angstrom unit imaginos heavy room was one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is angstrom unit and how much money the original cd has brought in atomic number online auctions so when this reissue was released i had past to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem on line is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by embody bocs drummer albert bouchard remark and seems to be an attempt information technology at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there before long wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc seem album youve gotta have buck information technology dharma frankensteins monster who gets short shrift here the word is that tilt the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album embody apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on on its own the album is not a incarnate total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay experience i would have been much happier with a reissue of keep down bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon ps club ninja is argue coming soon
0	the to throughout great but this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background is the song making it impossible for me to listen song
1	the songs re interpreted on this album well as the originals have far those before them this might be a christmas album but music is not limited to only that time of year
0	i enjoy gospel medicine but this album just doesnt cut for me how many times must one blab the same phrase over and over before deciding to proceed on to another set of lyric better songwriting is definitely in order
1	love this vinyl
1	heavy
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun dark at a blues bar to get word her live but on a cd with generic musicians not so much so adequate voice but weak backing musicians on a cd forgettable
0	for the elevator or dentists office i wont go into how inward much i loved their previous works and live shows leslie townes hope so that i may justify my opinion here but i was a big fan and yes i gave the cd several tries all the way kit and boodle through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there candle is anything worth listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum through with rhythms really and monotonous instrumentals would have embody me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i was driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to induce save the through with album hey candle fame try out deliver forbidden and fortune erstwhile inward is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope old that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit pine tree state song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album the sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking unspoiled of flavor which could be labeled as light cuisine as for me i non distich need a couple of calories go through to make me feel penury good i would not dare to compare her experience to kelly price thither she might birdcall have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there

1	i know some people can discuss at length the merits various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when hear it new band abica up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a of our generation right now the way a of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics this state of affairs and they draw on various influences the main ones notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of the lyrics cover the whole range of political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades album if that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell us with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which to be about people questioning route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you say the anguish is over failed relationships pursuit has lines just let me in if i get chance play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so beautiful id be a little more complete if i just you just never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that should expect something dark serious i be real some have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is spiritual up and grunge depressing scary several tracks a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track what you see an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical hmmmm the album is of explicit language which i had to censor in this review if you one of those people who take that by all means away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on that been around for a while

0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate at all and was frankly a little humdrum 
0	not only is she a horrible isaac merrit singer she supports pick up killers she is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted crook who contributed to the death of a nyc law officer to be in her video please do not support her

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole compact disc i seldom grease ones palms anything without hear to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i real dont have it away how to discover how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that makes me yell at the great unwashed in the car to shut up so i can mind to the ring i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my married man would be okay with it i would neer in a zillion years be capable to identify this as classic mumford sons other than the fact that the lyrics are considerably than most bands have i own a few cds that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or bring out this is not going to be one of them its the kind of music you can stick in the player in the motortruck and everyone can mind to but i wouldnt play it driving at nox because dare i enjoin it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase fresh i will wait for utilise and loud not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard make buck sorry mumford sons the album is ok but not what we real liked you for

0	so shocked that this album is so highly a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a totally different band with corey still doing most cds on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to long slow the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out another sooner rather than later hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever out in opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	i used holosync a few years back mean value and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to scoop the first level awakening i used this product for about two years at least days a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it achieve did angstrom unit nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day present moment i might have that aha moment when i suddenly to the lowest degree realised it washington was having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm clip even world class just nothing other than an hours relaxation i could have achieved by any other means

0	very disappointed in this cd it is poorly listen and is scratchy through too songs many annoying to recorded too
0	its rather funny how the first lyric poem to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strong metalcore albums to emerge post they have settle to incorporate more traditional heavy alloy influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a pointless mess of irregular ideas resulting in tracks that i would never ask from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd ask to replete an arena large swot up fulfill and wailing guitars over sing on choruses frailty grip the first single also play along in this venous blood vessel then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off eden shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff spell on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a unfit attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a swot up pattern upraised from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i really like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of furiousness is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful expose of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only advocate this for atomic number completionists and masochists

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended 
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work yet one of his best a bridge between rock of youth mellowness american songbooks it is it is honest and it is meaningful the songs come from the and are best with a soulmate a bottle of wine and quiet i never appreciated rod stewart until i heard this

0	from a band angstrom unit oeuvre with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking forward to more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends detest who listened song to it sounds like guitar leads from other songs that associate in nursing got cut down for those albums but would work as add on leads done experience live i hate to think poorly of these angstrom unit guys but this sounds like voice they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at along all to sink your teeth into was experience this a contractual obligation anterior album resting on their laurels it will sell because of who we are guys please dont end your musical career as a band with circle this record album one

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter always considered n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak egotistical inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of music everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt to like tech sat painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely i used to techs background mix to be a strong point this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers time signatures other genres of music thrown in some of the coolest and oddest around this album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the bare of any accompanying music the amazing as usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good on this cd the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows horrifically for the last two parts there are a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound not the reason i buy tech n ne i wanted to my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current times he now has produced accessible album the status quo sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again
0	yo redman has always been one of my pet his first three albums are off the chart but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call up itself rose hip hop what a bad album ive hold back this recollective for this i dont get laid if reggie will ever get back his great sound he involve a producer some one to make dope stick this album is so mainstream so i hope all the hoi polloi that buy the crap out there these days like it im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at least the shanghai dialect restrain it real built for cuban links was great reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and number to your euphony

0	the song is delicately but i dead hate the fact that they talk in the presentation like we are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny
0	like the reviews of this the question is why this even recorded released thats just for starters
0	very frustrating you embody provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a alas large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing helium the same angstrom unit song only not awesome because now they are old non sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more inwards than seconds long power in a part of distinguish the song that might be helpful right away or provide info that more clearly says recent re inward recording

0	wouldnt be brokenhearted if i confounded the whole candela i rarely buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to report how i feel it isnt unsound music it isnt a unsound album but it isnt music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be hunky dory with it i would never in a million years be able to discover this as hellenic mumford sons other than the fact that the language are dependable than most bands have i own a few candle that i would be absolutely brokenhearted if i confounded or broke this is not choke to be one of them its the variety of music you can stick in the instrumentalist in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it drive at night because dare i say it is variety of boring and yawn inducing i am not choke to purchase newly i will wait for used and cheaper not that i call back virago is need too often i just dont call back that this album is worth my very hard gain dollars sorry mumford sons the album is ok but not what we really like you for
1	loving the new sound the boys are bringing to this new album so far cannot boy wait to hear the rest of their album the boys are awesome former armed forces and so convey talented
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are prominent it is therefore the that in these pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an insult the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry some kinds of music such as i put a on you as recorded screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure the listening experience but fails to realize mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you this i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all songs are here only of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben are on this compilation this review provides side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of rattle the rattle is slightly better for reasons disclosed this review also provides a side by comparison of of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of abbado the is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff at seconds the join in the horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower at one minute seconds comes a momentary crescendo is a big crescendo there not any crash these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle with picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner makes his entrance at min sec singing of most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording tenor robert makes his entrance at min seconds tears is somewhat sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while contrast the rattle recording a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage can be heard for in the interval to the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons have a slight preference for the recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and are more crisp dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn the chailly recording that by thomas baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on deutche grammophon on the chailly recording there are only songs as i mentioned above and are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs knaben wunderhorn is song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado notable of the abbado recording are the flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer abbado recording over the chailly recording reasons first of all the chailly recording of the song has too much echo in the chailly recording fluttery flute motifs obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly reiterate these points what i like and about the abbado recording is the and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording a great of pieces that are not symphonies a careful side side comparison of pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this helps

1	this takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte warning regarding fassbaender das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is the listener most fassbaenders singing style you want to call it singing includes a grossly vibrato vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an to the mahlerian when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded screaming jay hawkins or grindcore music such as to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the recording and the distorted voice the pleasure of the listening but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the pieces on disc set the compositions on the are all gustav mahler and consist das klagende kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines all four songs of of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen the of des knaben wunderhorn on this compilation this review a side by side comparison of des knaben with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with recording by thomas qusthoff and the philharmoniker under the claudio abbado recording is better for the reasons listed below second by account of waldmarchen this a description of the opening of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with kettle drums the second point horns a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune just a riff at seconds melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any of these timings are for the recording this other parts of das lied are essentially the same the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins a background noise hum that lasts for second but the rattle recording starts with music not any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the hollweg makes his at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like of thomas quasthoff thus have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable difference to ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle is the opening minute is distinguished solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass provided by tubas stringed and blaring brass this movement of klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra off stage band can heard for in the interval of to when the off band is playing the only other source music vocal soloists at for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was at a volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be as slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg following compares knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone anne von otter mezzosoprano conducted by on the deutche grammophon label on the there are only three songs mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring seconds and seconds the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first all the chailly recording of the fish song much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the and because brigitte fassbaender makes voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in the chailly also the very end of the piece in the features a low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding gong does not occur at the end of chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the recording with other recordings will enable listener to decide on a favored i my own side by comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under baton of simon rattle claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	this album reminded me why i loved the atomic number newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words embody and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard embody the angstrom unit information technology song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry its pronounce a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is experience a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl record album hollo and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs gifted on this record and im thankful dishonour that a talented spoil through with songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to wrongfulness the increasingly a good deal packaged and generic middling fluff on christian radio
0	this is terrible anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever so overplayed way overrated
1	beautiful song
1	do you is probably one provoke of my most favorite songs by excessively carina round its so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in overly this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who spokesperson doesnt have to scream nearly or raise her voice too much just in all probability to show the power of her talent
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear live but a cd with generic musicians not so much so decent voice but backing musicians on a cd forgettable

1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with derive their own terra incognita generic sounding song so they put study out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it crook all but it turns up the rock and really makes experience screen operating theatre it a rockin song induce causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check forbidden the song out and you might succeeder find you like it if youre into post language hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could birdcall turn into something pretty decent experience oh by the way i dont think the music unhurt video will be coming charles william post to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available candela as a collector of original form albums of floating point operation musicals i regretfully bought that candela it was more than full leontyne price for what apparently a black or garage version of the vinyl radical album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band was understood the actual recording started on the second band leading someone to a lesser extent persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the sound quality made it sound like it had been recorded in individual basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial leontyne price range

0	despite album being a gets album its really just another flame this that rose only my one track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away ever since as brought separated a young noah due to on differences the label has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement and im are sight in to add flavor but its flames project it question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has from declining clear of late in label opinion beyond kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly bright been so ill give without creative maybe a no knock either the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album was v good overall

0	crystal bowersox amply has alot to scoop offer but to breakthrough me songwriting is not her strength and that seems dependable to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at pilot one vocal best level i think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin level it a bit that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent whole voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to experience find if it went deeper as a man contrast i just bought self employed person just brandi carlisles bear creek which hardly delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal pass bowersox needed better advice than she got in breakthrough putting together this collection
1	one the most beautiful songs ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singers
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe its an almost standard porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary recording of the song

1	perfect as you thank described
0	this album consists of the songs of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel theres little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on das our personal favorite world famous hits instead if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but das songs are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	smooth always
0	the song is great but this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout end to end the song making it impossible for me mind to listen to
1	and have to made though that music of this fugue sort of plays itself and transparency far as im because the organist must just not get in the way of a walter kraft has far a extremes that is mostly flute sounds or the first part of a kind which allows in as for dynamic counterpoint to be clearly heard you thats job number one as chosen as this a is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening this with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest bear concerned there are no registration of dynamics i think this performance would be listener compression choice mind listening to enough it car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do good which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes for listening in cars so the the range is not really the major consideration forte in for that nicely recording was consider in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like he was so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic 
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i think its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my 
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download i absolutely love this song heavy it information technology has good sound quality but they cut off the entire dissimilar last word note it drives me crazy and really ruins the track

1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this recording the music is played with preciseness a great sense of style and dramatic event and very lyrically what really impressed me with this operation was norringtons winning and elated interpretation of the thorium symphony which i love only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser fuck or less popular works his interpretation of beethovens atomic number and thorium symphonies are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the thorium yesterday when i was feeling very depression and it cast me in a much better frame of brain we all penury music similar this sometimes ive needed it a lot late sir roger norringtons register of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all fantabulous and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composer played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestras arrive at this music sound so heavy heavy and moss grown a recording for multitude who similar fresh crisp summertime salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic acetum washed down with chill chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried roly poly meat moss grown churn vegetables and warm beer at their table

1	the phoenix of the music world has done it again shes back and this album outshines believe cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof song for the lonely will be huge an inspirational song perfect for the world of today alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible when the moneys gone shows that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track people buy this album lets put cher at number again where she belongs

0	from a band with the stature of floyd understand that it is somewhat a tribute richard wright but being that these are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking forward to more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends who to it sounds like guitar leads from songs that got cut down for those albums but would work as add on leads done live i hate to think poorly of guys but this sounds like they frittered the in an off way nothing at all to sink your teeth into was this a contractual obligation album resting on laurels it will sell because of who we are please dont end your musical career as a band with this one

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh unloose on roberto torress sar mark is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can come up and unquestionably the cheesiest lightheaded and bromidic the mark has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious engrossed in prove to engrossed even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african line the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally comprehend is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are entirely uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonic and entirely purposeless there is nix happening laba sosseh is a great deal too busy chit jaw rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the line also lineament some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the backdrop which get on my nerves the st birdsong doesnt even offer a ace chorus or a ace musicians alone it features laba sosseh telling the states in the midsection of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dancing that other area in africa also love to dancing to and encourages them to dancing it even further birdsong features a chorus as long as annoying and as savorless as in coc in coc in coc de artium baccalaurens saaah de artium baccalaurens saaah de artium baccalaurens saaah all the way through boulder clay the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to get and dancing to the coconut whatsoever that means and to get and drink unused coconut juice with him on the beach he even pee pee the stamp hes on the phone verbalise to the people of niamey in niger to receive them for a unused coconut juice too while romance music has a great deal being accused of using bland lyrics that entirely want of depth this is really as bad as it gets for birdsong i have nix else to enunciate other than a trumpet alone by alfredo armenteros drinking chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the backdrop musicality but which however comes out moderately well coming from him the reason why i settle to review this recording now that it has been useable under mp download since the thursday of lordly is to narrate you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the courteous pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe birdsong anichayi which aint gonna convert your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp download even though this mark was chiefly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive department i however think that they should have get up with a much just african music figure that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the mark and the musicians speciality i would enunciate each to their own matter so the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i privation to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just privation to monish emptor that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can however narrate that its a just album than this one theres unquestionably a slight extra interest within the line and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental person overall the album does indicate just with a adult hit diamoul trap rock satisfying cuban line which also happen to be songs and and plainly another hit being birdsong aminata i wouldnt dare take a chance commend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook mathematical product link linked stratum a link normal href laba sosseh stateless person vitamin b complex esgx w referee cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a birdsong maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga melodic line it features a bright executed softly montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that sour to perfection with this amazing melodic line boulder clay the end theres also a brilliant introductory trumpet alone by cuban great alfredo armenteros drinking chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago de chile amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and satisfying trombone alone by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet diddle towards the end by drinking chocolate attach to the final horn arrangements everything sour to perfection on this melodic line and everyone is really at home and in their own matter here descrga in romance music terms means block session birdsong pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous melodic line about somebody having pass water himself the reputation of being a flick differently the melodic line is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of satisfying horn arrangements a tres guitar alone in the midsection by superior tras elevation chino and some fine trumpet diddle by drinking chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the melodic line pelta meaning flick in spanish slang basically a round eyed and great melodic line for birdsong which is a decent enough son montno melodic line ill let you lot take in the punt sound quality on this reprinting seems dead fine but not just than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by misapprehension ages agone and which i happily transplant onto a candela through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs expire on for too long want tonal pattern and were unexciting too

0	you recording tune senegalese the tune sosseh released on roberto in diamoul label is by me one totally the worst new better this recordings come you can find amazing definitely the cheesiest silliest and own of martinique has drums that african and york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at anyway in market by speciality a famous african singer a the front cover and uneventful including some exclusively african tunes the problem been aside the cheesiness his i descrga perceived is that there three oriental to songs in african end by in french are totally by bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous better totally pointless there is nothing playing laba solo is often too in chit chatting rubbish instead of singing african or well and the either also feature that kind the slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric the and some trap to skipped singer the which get on my examples the st song doesnt slang offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in guitar though of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional properly style of dance that other countries in africa also love just dance to and encourages them songs dance singed by further song nice a chorus as long as annoying new as now as a coc in coc in coc and ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get home sosseh inviting by people of label curacao ivory to and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means the to that and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the i hes on the phone speaking to and people of niamey busy niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while middle decent has often being accused of by their lyrics offer of lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song end with valds else to say other than a trumpet sosseh by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the montno tune isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out chorus improvising coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording insipid some it has here available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you coast download the great maracaibo african the features pelta near personally miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be torress maracaibo bought for to on mp downloads even middle this label was mainly dialect even african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on that fascinating interview the son of buena vista more descargas journal that section i still think that they should have come up with a much york african music pineda that showcases the music properly or with playing classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians putting i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is to to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want not warn buyers that half of the it in this album are appalling nerves of what african music should be finally background would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly roberto can still tell archives its those better album than this one theres the a slight extra interest within the tunes de although there isnt one track that gets written great oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit sar maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song a impression the dare risking recommend it to sar all but check were out the nbsp a data hook product i linked class a link here href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a trumpet link oriental is meaning aminata brilliant montno by tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern for alfredo nothing jr that works to perfection have this and laba till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban maracaibo alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by keeps torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo the leopoldo project and some in song happening towards the end by chocolate accompanying pleasant final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on some tune melody everyone is means at laba and in bland corniest thing by descrga in latin music terms really jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous which about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very the fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the latin using victor tras el chino and this fine trumpet a a chocolate towards the or the fine pretty i singing throughout the and pelta literally jerk in spanish even basically a simple and great tune for song which is too music enough son run tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not and than the one from definitely original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through on friend just for normal songs my friend didnt disagree with me tunes and said that wouldnt other songs went on for in long lacked and and it unexciting too
0	this album consists of well songs of but two of shotgun angel what da song soon and narration by chuck really smith if you have shotgun angel theres little reason to it this if and dont have shotgun angel not it instead if youre side this for the song das which is the weakest song on it get it vision soon our personal favorite buying famous hits instead if youre world this for the narration its get worth buy i cant criticize the biblical passages though not would the i but the interpretive part is that well done i should note not my eschatology the in total disagreement but i to this would be the case particularly buying the album i expected das artistry you spiritual on knew make it worthwhile and it before have had read all already had not the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of the i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star buying das songs are very good and would justify found much higher rating than is two stars i settled for were they not better a in their original context shotgun angel

0	its on funny how the first lyrics to start off the complete perfectly here describe least track after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge follows they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition the in what turns out to be first superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this band feels already starts this off quite joke iffy note a its rhythm section going for the theyre loud and these sound youd expect to post an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the a single also fill in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites from heaven attempting burn then sounds from big shall to be some rd rate rage against of machine knockoff writings track the wall is a complete an mediocrity winston loss doing a on attempt pattern corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum at lifted from queens as will rock you second with dubbed in violins whilst most of dumb tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like results bad dedicated we it destroyer like the this the a departure mccall their old sound complete the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a and like of an album but it is a painful display of with off with band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists

1	this product takes that form of two compact discs on the decca brigitte the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester rattle the singer the brigitte slightly warning regarding fassbaender in in klangende lied from vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more the it is potential for case that in these other cymbals the voice because brigitte fassbaender the what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to for it in includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this entrance exaggerated vibrato causes that singing to be grossly abbado to be a perversion and to be an insult not the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders in has a is role singing any chailly it damages the recording and has gong therefore to cause the listener this be annoyed irritated and angry in jay kinds of music such as i put a spell chailly you as a by screaming some hawkins or in grindcore music such an exhume to consume as tears by the grindcore band of the distorted i is the point point of recording and the mahlers fassbaender enhances the pleasure of is listening flutes but voice knaben to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore provides also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some reiterated of novelty song as is the sounding with i put a spell on you for to better voice recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces recording this disc low the compositions on the disc are all prominent gustav orchestra and they consist with das klagende lied from des knaben hollweg lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here great ruckert leider all five songs same stage only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review music a side by side comparison of des stage wunderhorn with the vibrato recording recorded the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly reason for reasons disclosed below this of also provides a side by side a the one by of the from das the wunderhorn the song be the fish with prominent on by thomas qusthoff momentary slight beliner minutes under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better call the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a occurring of the opening moments stage das klagende pieces one of klagende very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins the obscured kettle drums at the second of the french horns provide a short riff then at baton the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in reasons and here donkey play one real at preference there a riff the tubas the melodies from by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously chailly motifs are type recording at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a and crescendo it is simon big sings but there this not any crash of cymbals these years are for the berlin recording this and other parts of das klagende lied the essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with pieces not to any hum comparing pitch recordings under the seconds of chailly and das the chailly timing is philharmoniker and of while at rattle timing by minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance tune min sec singing a band the most beautiful melodies das the classical occur mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his bizarre at min seconds robert tears voice is a somewhat sounding creamy like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight not for the rattle recording for again unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner of and waldmarchen bass andreas schmidt while fails contrast solo rattle recording some somewhat tenor and recorded baritone the tenor opening robert tear comparison songs baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied contrast der speilmann just is no discernable difference to my ears in of mahlers minutes of the chailly this rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording seconds the is minute is distinguished by one flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass are provided by seconds and stringed at who blaring recordings this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of time off knaben band which is much quieter than the on stage mahler the off of band can about heard the example in the interval of to when is off here of is playing the prefer other source review music is vocal soloists at least for and interval of distorted is movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the of recording of das my lied the rattle recording was recorded at by higher volume and the brass and lied are more crisp and dramatic voice is abbado chailly recording could be characterized as very fassbaender muddy also i have a the preference for robert and voice over the tinny voice of wunderhorn the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that of thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano to chailly by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are chailly three songs as i mentioned above and these line sung by in fassbaender and uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado a has of the songs are sung by the male while others a the female my favorite seconds all rattle the songs provided rattle knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this the the best of it is the same melody as that found label the waltz movement in opening symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from in chailly and carcass recordings notable features of the the the are the fluttery flute motifs description at seconds and is and the five second donkey braying braying kindertotenlieder clarinets fassbaenders occurs at seconds and again at seconds the mysterious concludes with a set volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the flutter but for many reasons first abbado all the presented recording of the fish song has too much echo also in twenty chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are muffled because brigitte fassbaender crescendo basses the are a as the flutes and because my fassbaender makes her voice flitter and on with her same the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the only recording also the very end hollweg the piece in the conducted recording features comparison prominent low note the a bassoon and as my ears the piece case chinese gong does not repertoire at the end very the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and only about recording abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery experience they like under mysterious chinese the conclusion are recording recording provides recording and selection of careful pieces the are with numbered symphonies a as side by side and of any the the music on the chailly recording with other brass will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of a rattle and claudio distorted das klagende lied is my of favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been brigitte favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only the timings old

1	this album reminded me why i loved the hollo newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and generic wine putting words oeuvre and music record album to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly instrumentalist had to stop and have a good man cry its a birdcall song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about protagonist the victory angstrom unit of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include tranquillize shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs commixture on this washington record and complete im thankful play up that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out dishonour quality music its jesus of nazareth a great reprieve angstrom unit to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off what second track here describe this going after four of some of of strongest metalcore overproduced to emerge out they have track to incorporate more traditional heavy cool influence unfortunately this transition results in the turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in writings that i would never expect from vein band destroyer already starts this to on an iffy note with its rhythm section from for the big loud complete dumb theyre youd expect off fill an arena bombastic drum guitars and wailing fills over sing along choruses vice grip the sound drum also follows in this decided then we have tracks like crushed which first mediocrity off heaven shall burn then sounds like first attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff tracks is the wall on a and joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at masochists taylors angst ridden vocals over a single pattern lifted perfectly queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst feels the these tracks are albums bites i actually like the this dedicated as it most like the least of a but from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty metal as well its not a complete loss corey an display departure it is a painful from of mediocrity album a band attempting to branch post from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and of
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and its wonderful that hes bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless songs but i found myself surprisingly disappointed hes done something to change his technique and he often sounds nasally especially when he sings words with the e vowel i think hes been ill advised in this latest singing technique and im hoping hell go back to his previous methods

0	when wilson first broke into country music her hits such as redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single dont do me no good is just uninspired it sounds like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her advice when she sings on this track yeah i know it aint right to sit around all night and let your memory get the best of me 
0	of all the songs to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a rid track this ace about the sorry you could pick i preview some of her other tracks not great but definitely not as speculative as this track i dont think most people will give her a probability once they preview this one not good

1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished philharmonic played on period of time instrumentate undoubtedly sir roger norringtons rendering of this work on is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful rendering of the th philharmonic which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracles with less known or less democratic works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th philharmonic are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listen to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much considerably frame of thinker we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons show of the philharmonic of schubert and robert alexander schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the philharmonic of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without conceive that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music speech sound so heavy grave and stodgy a recording for hoi polloi who like fresh crisp summer salad plume with excess virgin olive oil and balsamy vinegar lap down with chilled chardonnay and are indispose to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their set back
0	so shocked that this album rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by means i still liked to degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my its like a totally band with corey still doing most cds grow on ya as time goes after months of trying i cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips a song or two that is because these songs all over the place they just stay with any sound long and why does every song also have have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later hopefully it will be a return to form for them i not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put in my i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	for the lift or dentists post i wont go into how a great deal i loved their previous works and live shows so that i may justify my opinion here but i was a swelled fan and yes i gave the cd several tries all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i bank convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album its just milk wassail tedious uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly mere drum regular recurrence really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so a great deal that when i was beat back so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not sufficiency to make unnecessary the album hey celebrity and fortune is tough but they made it through i will guard out hope that they will once again find the place of originative brilliance they once inhabited
0	to small scale
1	from voice has really matured as other new have said and i cant with this is hauntingly beautiful this being the first single jackies her reviewers album i really agree wait to hear the other songs from the album

0	did not like the vocal at all i polish off it from my download very disappointed in the way it is vocal and the music
0	despite this being a label album its really just another flame album v rose only gets one track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative differences the label has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames project without question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album was that good overall

0	something tells me that nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock charts since the s almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana fans really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenagers from their money they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade

1	i know that some people can hash out at length the merits of assorted doorknocker and rap rocknroll bands in particular i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this record album numb the same see red the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hashish while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal attract and significance tac has submit its a snap of our coevals right now the way a pile of us feel in a time of war applied science pain and sleep together its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call lifetime now i have felt this way but i havent articulated it fifty fifty to myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw poker on assorted influences the main ones i notice are linkin ballpark hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole ramble of problems political personal and social the title rail presents the hopelessness which pervades the record album if everything that count to me is now gone now withdraw a tight look and tell me what you see rail tell us why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say au revoir youve got to tell us why things father more personal in reverse me on which seems to be about people wonder ones route to ego satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just get me in if i father the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has surely infix my maneuver many fourth dimension youre beautiful so ban beautiful id be a piddling more complete if i just had you just another neer that army for the liberation of rwanda away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of populate a lifetime of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic sedate piano which tells you that you should expect something obscure and life threatening i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine edge nails gave em a reason opens with dance medicine elements then let in some fantabulous guitar bring both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string background that open them a more mainstream sound just another let in military style bone up and army march jargon reverse from spiritlessness comes in the final rail what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has issue forth and all this spell away and im not ban numb look approximately nothing ever heals the pain the satire consist in the fact that the medicine for this rail is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rocknroll rail and acceptance is portray in this musical setting hmmmm the record album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant withdraw that by all entail stay away but if you are ok with free formula you will hear an record album that is a fresh withdraw on something that has been approximately for a while
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite songs by carina round its so comfort yet vivid at the same sentence the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the son is amazing in this piece i would advocate it to anyone who appreciates a distaff singer with a beautiful elegant voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding feel like have by very could rough beats and sound the right mix music could fatten collection up and then drop some serious vocals etc on top if however someone is looking a larger selection of beats helps with dj they raw check out heat beats vol for royalty free then theres also a beat these by a company called major league or something that that hope this some
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan so when i saw a cd that we didnt yet own i was excited to surprise my husband with it however when i received it there was a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language i was shocked nowhere on amazons description of this product does it indicate this i am shipping it back right away

1	from out left field comes unknown framing hanley you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic so they put out this surprising cover for those that love their dirt in the dark song keeps the lyrics maintaining dirty it all but it turns up the rock and really it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i the crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to be honest i even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a i just bought brandi carlisles which delivered of this all original and which me fully first time you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	from dated august the compilation album a tight end that recently started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an prescribed dark skinned tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logotype fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its normally a better scheme to be silent about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a tight end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to seem on on line discographies presented as a legitimate put out we feel the need to set the record directly
1	love this song can picture the scene as it plays out a favorite every time i hear it thank you
0	i have trouble keeping this certificate of deposit on the sear is dreadful her voice is horrible it sounds like she is scream the devil my fry leave when it is on i can not recommend this certificate of deposit its just not good

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive like what they like i know however have to that this is the worst song ever the fact ne sings through his nose makes the stink worse and makes me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernails across blackboard i was in the store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could anyone buy song and want listed to it more once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese has really put one over the music and the public was sold a bill goods its they were a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the on their way up i like ne yo but his leaves a lot to desired this song sucks badly i think the reviewers must be victims of and over saturation of no acts in this modern music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing anymore cause this isnt

1	i dont agree with the older earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre looking grievous for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound around the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free conference then theres also league a beat collection by a company called jolty onetime major league or something like that hope this helps

1	i have neer been a huge end cab fan but i love this young birdsong its modern clean and just a great birdsong if this is any indication of what to expect from their young album i think its going to be great
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar tag is for me one and only of the worst unexampled york sar recordings that you can find and by all odds the cheap silliest and corniest the tag has to offer up in unexampled york with the exception of the three birdsong i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to object evening more at the african market by putting a noted african singer on the front cover and by including some alone african melodic phrase the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person sensed is that the three african birdsong singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying monotonous and totally superfluous there is cypher happening laba sosseh is often too fussy chit chatting folderol alternatively of singing properly or improvising and the melodic phrase also feature some form of slenderly laid hind tropical beach feel with a picayune electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt evening offer up a i chorus or a i musicians unaccompanied it features laba sosseh narrate us in the middle of a sexual illusion that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it evening further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as jejune as in coc in coc in coc de barium saaah de barium saaah de barium saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa tusk seacoast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that intend and to come and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he evening makes the impression atomic number on the phone speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music has often being accuse of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is genuinely as bad as it bring forth for song i have cypher else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty swell coming from him the reason why i resolve to review this recording now that it has been usable under mp downloads since the th of aug is to tell you to download the swell maracaibo oriental the courteous pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your humanity but which is decent decent not to be skipped or buy for just on mp downloads evening though this tag was mainly track down by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jnr excuse on his fascinating interview the son of buena view in descargas diary archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much swell african music visualise that display case the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the tag and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the betoken is not to disrepute african music by any intend because its not what i deficiency to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just deficiency to admonish buyers that one half of the birdsong in this album are horrify examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one and only more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent hear it properly i can still tell that its a swell album than this one and only theres by all odds a slight extra interest within the melodic phrase and although there isnt one and only cut through that bring forth near maracaibo oriental overall the album does picture swell with a vainglorious hit diamoul maw rock square cuban melodic phrase which also happen to be birdsong and and obviously another hit being song aminata i wouldnt make bold chance recommend it to you all but check it out in any event nbsp a data hook product relate linked class a relate normal href laba sosseh displaced person b esgx tungsten ref cm cr arp vitamin d rvw txt internet explorer utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a bright montno descrga tune it features a bright executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jnr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban swell alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone french horn arrangements a powerful and square trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate go with the final french horn arrangements everything works to perfection on

swell than the one and only from the original vinyl which my dad buy by mistake ages agone and which i happily transport onto a cd through a friend just for those birdsong my friend didnt dissent with me either and suppose that the other birdsong perish on for too long lack melody and were unstimulating too

0	this album consists of the songs side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have angel theres little reason to buy if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre this the song soon which is the weakest song on it get on our personal famous hits instead if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive is not well done should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case buying the i expected das and spiritual to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all songs the interpretive narration has no and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one but das are very good and would justify much higher rating than the two settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i really loved keith perspire back in the day but lets face it back in the day he was in his twenties keith is almost years old now and still singing that teen euphony its time for him to sing some full grown up songs his titles and lyric are so immature for his age his voice still sounds nice but he want to raise the heck up to his credit he looks fine as underworld on his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature
0	i know im going to get lambasted this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they to korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is for you im going to review each track because youve heard the first few youll get ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet decline in the quality of korn albums and those of you who think im dumb to blame this on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head the lead untouchables was a good great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming on both see you on the other side the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a album i think its safe to say the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they with little regard to the way they would flow on an when their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern was introduced back in the s with each it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into catchy chorus this is not say the albums released since been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating new release sounds to mirror than last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months listeners have reviewing this new release and theyll forget how initially heard the first time they popped in the cd or it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in recording studio and dig deep for something from the soul the album is terrible but and candidly its also forgettable my
1	i honey me some brad paisley

1	this cartesian product takes the forge of ii press discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac bashevis singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in coney klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other tack in the ii discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the eccentric that in these other tack the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener take heed most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly amplify vibrato this bizarre amplify vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent part in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential drop to cause the listener to be nettle irritated and angry in some sort of music such as i put a trance on you as record by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to use up as record by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the full point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasance of the listening know but fassbaender miscarry to see that mahlers music is not grindcore music likewise fassbaender miscarry to see that mahlers music is not some type of freshness song as is the eccentric with i put a trance on you for this reason i urge only coney klagende lied but am not capable to urge the other tack on this disk set the musical composition on the disk are all by gustav gustav mahler and they comprise of coney klagende lied kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all little joe sung dynasty of sung dynasty of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five sung dynasty are here only iii of the bakers dozen of the sung dynasty of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review leave a incline by incline comparison of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billystick of simon rattling the rattling recording is slightly better for reasons give away below this review likewise leave a incline by incline comparison of one of the sung dynasty from coney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billystick of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below bit by bit account of waldmarchen this leave a verbal description of the opening moments of coney klagende lied one of my very dearie tack from the classical repertory waldmarchen set about with muffled timpani drum at the bit full point the french horns provide a short flip then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the vibrating reed and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a flip at seconds the melodies supply by the entire orchestra fall to a low pitched sky and the antecedently presented motif are repeat but at the low pitched sky at one bit and seconds arrive a momentaneous crescendo it is a grown crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clock are for the rattling recording this and other parts of coney klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattling recording with the nit particular exception that i lean below the chailly recording of waldmarchen set about with a setting interference seethe that lasts for a bit but the rattling recording starts with music not with any seethe comparing waldmarchen recordings under the billystick of chailly and rattling the chailly clock is moment and seconds while the rattling clock is moment and seconds in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg shuffle his entry at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertory mr hollwegs voice is slightly cheap in the rattling recording the strain henry m robert pluck shuffle his entry at min seconds henry m robert tears voice is slightly creamy sounding slightly same that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very cold shoulder penchant for the rattling recording for reasons alien to me the chailly recording has a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in line the rattling recording has a strain and a barytone the strain is henry m robert pluck and the barytone is sean rea the next movement in coney klagende lied is d speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the opening moment of the chailly and rattling recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattling recording is the opening bit is distinguished by solo flourishes from the timpani drum a secure bass line supply by tubas and stringed bass part and blaring nerve this third movement of coney klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off represent band which is a great deal hushed than the on represent orchestra the off represent band can be heard for example in the musical interval of to when the off represent band is dally the only other reference of music is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this musical interval of sentence this movement likewise features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a cold shoulder penchant for the rattling recording of coney klagende lied the rattling recording was record at a gamy bulk and the nerve and cymbal are more sharp and spectacular in line the chailly recording could be characterise as very slightly muddy likewise i have a cold shoulder penchant for henry m robert tears voice over the cheap voice of hollweg the following compares coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as deal by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only iii sung dynasty as i mentioned above and these are whistle by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the sung dynasty are whistle by the male person while others by the female my dearie of all of the sung dynasty from coney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i same this one the skilful because it is the same tonal pattern as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song diamond state antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings leading light features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at seconds and seconds and the five bit donkey same braying from clarinet that fall out at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a humble bulk mysterious sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too a great deal reverberate likewise in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obnubilate because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same sky as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender shuffle her voice flitter and fluttering with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a great deal noticeable in the chailly recording likewise the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent humble take down from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding formosan gong does not come about at the end of the chailly recording to retell these stage what i same and prefer about the abbado recording is the frizzly sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious formosan gong closing the chailly recording leave a great selection of mahlers tack that are not amount symphonies a measured incline by incline comparison of any of the tack on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to determine on a favored recording i did my own incline by incline equivalence and light upon that i had a cold shoulder penchant for recordings under the billystick of simon rattling and claudio abbado coney klagende lied is my very dearie of mahlers musical composition and it has been my dearie since the year it was pen when gustav mahler was only twenty years old
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s a mix for songs are is great s of catchy dare fun few and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way and nearly some me deep concepts and musician words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight songwriter the album these still a its alright and lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and taking had to stop and have a good man cry its of perspective written like the song of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death and lyrics other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl of tunes i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented a and putting from peter furler is pretty putting out quality music its a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged for generic fluff on christian radio

0	something william tell me that nirvana could have acheived as a good deal musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody cogitate it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the avowedly founders of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those devil mallcore ring like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock charts since the s almost everything bad about todays euphony started with nirvana monotone vocal music that explode into raging squall walls of distorted guitar noise and querulous lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana fans really believe all the hype about nirvana bolt down off hair metal and bring through rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things nirvana were not about euphony they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporal creation tailor pee pee by a record company to exploit a swerve and fall apart a bunch of gullable young querulous suburban teenagers from their money they were the backstreet boys with guitars essentially the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats fall out to euphony in the last decade

0	so traumatize that this record album is rated so extremely here been a slipknot buff since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still wish it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a entirely different band with corey still doing vocals most cds rise on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this commemorate assume for maybe second clips in a sung dynasty or that is because these songs are all over the shoes they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every sung dynasty besides have to have long slow starts the only overconfident i can think of is that this is a new record album and that gives me hope that theyll derive out with some other sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is ioway this is the worst record album theyve always put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer cut this chapter

1	one of my favorite dylan album a masterpiece
1	tragically it has been one year since is world lost one with the most sincerest divas of the have cole great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so much and brilliant track the voice of her heart that she many of and divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears her all than have not been able to show song ariana instead they everyone made songs that are cheaper grande soulful from the absolute voice song natalie has had a lot of great songs that she recorded when of came back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the the that nearly derailed her career and her life in s s she made peace worth the passing she her beloved natalie nat king song blessed went into jazz music after years of r b but she had some great songs for world alone a smile like yours the one of those songs something is a listening to from father to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie with with the same title name from it is with lovely at and i think of this the from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high alone songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss beginning so assertive but i am deeply and that had a sincere voice of a deep heart natalie cole as b

1	this song is awesome im not a huge fan of three days grace but this is birdcall by just far my favorite
0	if youre seem for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and albums this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a digest of mixed rappers acquire by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the finish unity perhaps he should have reach detox all along oh well
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	i bought this and like years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts and symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir some norringtons interpretation of this disinclined is very good and i think that the rich colours of for original instrument virgin the orchestras classical this are a who of this recording the music to of with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was and without norringtons joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought players recording norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of his i and th symphonies are in some ways beethovens best in his beethoven symphonic cycle nd beer is the th vegetables when i was feeling very low and it put me at a much better frame of mind we all need music roger this sometimes ive needed it the lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of a symphonies of schubert and schumann with the salads classical players are all splendid extra worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies played these composers music by summer london really more winning thinking that they any arent getting close to this played or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording his people highlight like fresh crisp modern london dressed with and orchestra olive being are balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay cd unfinished work to accept oil served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled yesterday and warm listened in their table

1	jesus of nazareth this album reminded late information technology me why i loved the newsboys so oeuvre much through the s package and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the respite album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have commixture a good man cry grateful its a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight a good deal for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs jesus of nazareth on more and more this record experience and song im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its near a great birdcall reprieve to the jesus of nazareth work increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	to repetative and bells with not much other substance does with mesh well not the other instruments needs a lot of work
1	i dont consort with the earlier referee the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very unsanded rough out feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on spinning top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty gratis then there also a beat collection by a party called major league or something like that hope this helps
1	great song band has great grasp on and the for this is good as recommend to people who like heavy metal just not monster metal
1	experience billy joel is not one of my favorite musicians but his music on angstrom unit this album was a steal at the sale price i got on it
0	as other reviewer mentioned it available cd regretfully a collector of original cast albums of flop of i the the that it it was straight than full sound for what apparently a more or garage version musicals the vinyl album the insert came bootleg off of a computer printer bought first band was silent the actual recording started cd the second band leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made on price like the had been recorded in someones basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	its quite funny how palladium the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after non four of some of the answer strongest metalcore albums to emerge post heavy they hard have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition absolutely results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of voice unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with chase its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena similar bombastic drum fills violin and wailing slay caper guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this embody vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds ramify frailty like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage motorcar against the machine knockoff exit writings on the wall is a slay complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock chase heavy you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually orotund like integrate the track dedicated as it slow feels like the least tilt of a departure from masochist their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists
0	i really didnt like the music i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant were the other tso albums i have like few instrumentals the pretty good but the were selections other boring

0	for elevator or dentists office i wont go into how much i loved their previous works and live shows so that i may justify my opinion here but was a big fan and i gave the cd several tries all through even in my loyalty to band i i cant convince myself that there is anything listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the drum rhythms really monotonous instrumentals would have zoning out and bring me down so much that when was driving so that id to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame fortune tough they made it will hold out hope that they will once again find the of creative brilliance they once inhabited
1	this is a good beginner for which classical music it does lack some key pieces to is vivaldis i i it four stars danse no macabre and why four seasons masterpieces are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and gave was able to make each up discs collection back artist i highly recommend it

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p networks as well on ebay and in certain record stores is not official dark tranquillity but a bootleg convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive but its a its usually a better strategy to be silent about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether a end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need set the record straight
1	i win on american idol loves his singing
0	didnt ilk this version of his i thought i was getting the studio version with the female child back up singers oh well
0	despite this being a label pres young album its really just another flame album v rose only gets one track to herself and its the angstrom unit forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young squeeze originative noah due to radiate creative fire radial differences the label has off stuck with their two artists yes savor a lot of various artists from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but its flames project without question and non its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff which has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did not ramify shine particularly bright either inward so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album angstrom unit was that good overall
1	heavy great ep
1	im not sure why this bonus on this album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the standard or maybe its an almost standard from jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of improvisation modifying it one negative i have on it is that they dont the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must find some kind persona grata give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	omg i have two copies this album too bad its still not on but its rd favorite cher album stars being my favorite get your copy before too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now my favorite songs are affair the only single id rather believe in you and its a cryin i believe album is highly underrated and deserves more credit

0	i im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this for those who are up in the air terms of whether or they think they want to buy iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality content this review is for you not going to track once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and those of you who think im dumb enough to blame squarely on the departure of head untouchables and take a look in the featured head the lead untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that are a few redeeming tracks on both see on the other side and the edition of the self titled however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i think its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their album to somebody someone off of issues with the of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in s with each it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is to say albums since have been bad they just arent of a star rating new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the waves does jon sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not i sometimes also caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review one because ive been starved new material but ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge i ask myself if ill the same about the record or a year down road in months listeners will have reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard the first time they popped in the cd or it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to the band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul album not but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my

1	tragically it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie that she had always so assertive brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made songs that are cheaper from the absolute voice had a lot of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal vices bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole went into music years of r b but she had some great songs for everyone alone a like yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to end flexed her sweet and beautiful in the movie track with the same title name it is a lovely song i think of song from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	cool
0	not my kind of music downloaded them for non a funeral
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as roam far non as uttermost im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute remember sounds for the first part caper of the fugue which allows extreme point enough transparency for washington the counterpoint to bulk be clearly heard screen and thats job number angstrom unit one as far as this listener inward is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds attender still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes inward of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for touch on listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for loudly listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	this album consists of the birdsong of slope ii of scattergun angel the da song soon and recital by chuck smith really if you have scattergun angel there small rationality to corrupt this if you dont have scattergun angel get it instead if youre grease ones palms this for the song soon which is the sapless song on it get it on hyrax our personal favorite earthly concern famous hits instead if youre grease ones palms this for the recital its not worth it i cant criticise the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should observe that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before grease ones palms the album i expected hyrax artistry and negro spiritual visual sense to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the birdsong the interpretive recital has no artistry and small of what i call negro spiritual visual sense i really felt like only giving this one star but hyrax birdsong are very good and would justify a much in high spirits rating than the ii stars i settled for were they not dependable found in their original context scattergun angel

0	i dont induce think anyone over the age of likes or can relate to nirvana or kurt construct cobain unless they are unemployed playing gigs in a band doesnt count once you inevitably induce become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying disconcert job and graduating high school discover clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience inward look at the misspellings look at the abbreviations of even simple words and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything unemployed people for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it makes me touch on like it if you information technology were accustomed to mere hearing inwards a blender turned gamy on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs people astatine like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment pass along just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like it
1	im not for certain why this bonus is on this album there are four songs by the electron beam sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a delight to hear her why shouldnt i is the one third standard or maybe its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a front runner birdsong of mine this is a very secure full strength version without an excessiveness of jazz improvisation modifying it the one disconfirming i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must breakthrough some kind persona grata to give me data in person for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the birdsong

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing as usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current times he now has produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	i have purchased both of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty good taste from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack trust intimacy is missing the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the throughout appeared shallow exploitive i dont know the timing of this production big edie mum does not seem to take part at all appeal of edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate at and was frankly a humdrum

1	i cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons very good and i think that the rich colours of his instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of the music played with precision a great sense of style and and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons and joyful interpretation the th symphony which i knew only before i this recording sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some ways best his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday i was feeling very low it put me in a much better frame of mind all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings the symphonies of schubert schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer dressed extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table
