1	all right decently beyonce
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress inch done sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in in person new york with the exception of the three song i already brilliant mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by closing putting a famous african sung singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem mystify here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is done nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish elision instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also angstrom feature some figure kind of slightly laid back tropical equally beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even write offer a single chorus or a coiffure single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual inch fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and along sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him unaccompanied on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of diamond state niamey in niger to invite sung them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him reprinting the reason personify why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african it associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview scene the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that bribe they should arranging have come up with a alright much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would junior say each to their own thing only deep brown therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it alright a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest defy angstrom within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking pluck recommend it fragile to you all but check it boilersuit fragile out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a greco roman link normal href give birth laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune euphony it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there boast also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel he for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune archetype is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a reissue simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno raw tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems ask in absolutely fine but coiffure not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a tungsten friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that facilitate the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	i know that some people can discus at the merit of rapper and rap band detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb same anger same desperation the same hard edge but i think frontmen tac and hash while working from genre wanted to something of more universal appeal and tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship pursuit ha the line just let me in i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had just another never that and nothing here are generally about the of living a life of your in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic ecstatic spiritual up and grunge depressing down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march release from numbness come in the final track what you see with ironic twist they sing open up your eye more to the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something ha been around a while
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i commence delight government note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a prima review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each cut because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa inactive nice and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other english and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa drop off after issue and the isthmus started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the isthmus wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the free of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly associate pattern that wa introduced rearward in the s with each cut it took little imagination to know when the song would change pacing or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been sorry they just arent worthy of a prima rating this new free sound closer to mirror than the last ii but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the remainder of the nu metal ane hit wonder pollute the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last ii yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get view up in giving a new album a remarkable review after ane listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been train the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feeling the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new free and theyll blank out how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an military policeman player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the isthmus because theyre inactive ane of my favorite but a isthmus should realize that once the angst and the creativity is fail they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the register studio apartment and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock off collection might get one of these instead even worse they virtuoso might mistake it for the original collection like this need more one star review to help steer nostalgia power fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the experience but fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize mahler is not some type of novelty song a is the case with put spell on you for this reason i recommend da klagende lied but am not able to recommend piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second horn join in again and here they a real tune not just a riff at the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with nit picky exception that i below the recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum last for a but the rattle recording start with music with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is and second the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is creamy sounding like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard example in the interval of to when the off stage band is the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring second and second and the five second like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly of the fish song ha too much also the chailly recording fluttery flute are obscured because fassbaender at the same pitch a the flute because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with vibrato the clarinet sound is not much noticeable in chailly recording also the very of the piece in the recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at end of the chailly recording to reiterate point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in voice a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on rendering period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a cycle per second highlight unspoilt of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of immortalize style mossy and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th get dressed symphony are personify in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann acquire with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it low pitched colouring material modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed atomic number down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this album reminded me why i make love the newsboy so a good deal through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of hold some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first off clock when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man holler it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong fille and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic bollock on christian radio

1	louie prima and keely the king and queen of the s vega lounge circuit included in this recording is the seldom heard verse in just one of those thing
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst of these track are overproduced mediocrity i like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	it okey but not iggys best
1	this song wa just a i remember it from my teen year i really enjoyed listening to it more than once
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of consider various rapper and rap rock common band in detail i am not one of those people for me literary genre this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when trail versatile i hear it new band abica serf up information technology a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha some other stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the neer way a lot of u feel in inch a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and sacrifice of personify course eminem the lyric cover the nearly whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we associate in nursing are underground before give birth you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people apathy questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say atomic number the anguish articulate is raw over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance cure to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head angstrom many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a refer little more personify complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say coupling nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and existent grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from associate in nursing numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the angstrom music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and sense acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review record album so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok exhibit with free expression you will hear an regulate album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	this recording by rear end senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and give birth corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three downplay song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and personify totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too becoming busy chit chatting rubbish instead of agency singing properly or improvising and the tune also coiffure feature extinct some kind of slightly aside laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some entirely trap drum in the background which get on give birth my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u tonal pattern in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc write de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the plow end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the entirely coconut whatever that record album mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too jean arp while latin music ha often being accused of using rear bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the record album end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided house of york to review this recording now occur cut that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to melodic line tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a however pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with give birth a classic cuban inch style put down of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do eye and i do not have the agency yet competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would more than have explorer been one more laba sosseh recording on sar all in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than personify this one there definitely sung a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid information technology cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare evidence risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref angstrom cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf non laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by unaccompanied chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here however descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is but an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself usable the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end bread and butter the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough sung son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but daybook kit and boodle not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through oriental person a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around on a local radio station i wa driving in my cable car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood iheartradio likewise feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station anyways from my perspective see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the soul that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im prepare to aim the music complement the song a well
1	this is one of the greatest tune of the twelvemonth if not ever however i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean commixture on it but it dosent so now i get to buy another copy of this cd
0	im giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling the great unwashed to give star so this album can be on youre husband should be in jail for stealing
1	tragically it ha been one year since the universe drop off one of the most sincerest diva of the universe the great natalie colewort but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney gig and ariana grande have not been capable to present at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the sheer voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat baron colewort and went into jazz medicine after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her unfermented and beautiful voice in the movie rail with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i recall of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie colewort song b
1	this mathematical product contract the form of two succinct disk on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender admonition reckon fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral portion but in all the other assemble in the two disk the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other assemble the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you lack to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato lawsuit fassbaenders singing to be grossly perverted to be a perversion and to be an contumely to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to stimulate the listener to be harassed chafe and furious in some kind of medicine such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkyns or in grindcore medicine such a exhume to ware a recorded by the grindcore stria carcass the perverted voice is the manoeuvre of the recording and the perverted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that gustav mahler medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender fails to realize that gustav mahler medicine is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other assemble on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slenderly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of unrivaled of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slenderly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening import of da klagende lied unrivaled of my very favorite assemble from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with smother kettle drum at the second manoeuvre the gallic horn bring home the bacon a short riff then at second the flute join in the gallic horn re start at second and at second the walter reed and string join the fray at second the gallic horn join in again and here they play a real number tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra fall to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at unrivaled minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other portion of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exclusion that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise seethe that last for a second but the rattle recording get go with medicine not with any seethe comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly time is hour and second while the rattle time is hour and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing unrivaled of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slenderly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very svelte penchant for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass part andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a barytone the tenor is robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the next apparent movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ear in the opening hour of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by alone thrive from the kettle drum a strong bass part personal credit line provided by tuba and stringed sea bass and blaring brass this third base apparent movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage stria which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage stria can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage stria is playing the only other source of medicine is vocal soloist at least for this interval of clip this apparent movement also feature a chorus preference for the pursue reason i have a svelte penchant for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher loudness and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slenderly marshy also i have a svelte penchant for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the pursue compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are blab out by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are blab out by the manful while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this unrivaled the easily because it is the same melody a that found in the valse apparent movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like grind from clarinet that happen at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low loudness mysterious sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding formosan gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute donkey grind and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a neat selection of gustav mahler assemble that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the assemble on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and identify that i had a svelte penchant for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of gustav mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the class it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year honest to god

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

at the atomic number lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal personify to the lowest degree these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing degree is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the personify tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle dylan marlais thomas recording for reason unknown draw to me the chailly recording equally ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the heedful chailly and rattle give birth recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute trace is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and atomic number stringed slice bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which dylan marlais thomas is much pick out quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight comparison preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the information technology rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy consist also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted delight by abbado on the deutche john reed grammophon label on connect the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female kickoff my favorite of all of the song from da district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the boast abbado recording downplay are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second undertake intensity and second and the aside five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low often volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all information technology the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute consist and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her pick out vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point non what i like and prefer tenor voice about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a disk careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side spectacular comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the district attorney baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last slap up bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about day now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a basic of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all twenty four hour period before recording either the dj wa totally uninventive i am used to tech background mix to be a warm point of this creative person commonly a complex mixture of big administration synthesizer different time signature other genre of music hold in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely vitrine anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me haywire there are good track on this cd most of the anger start out of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last ii part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to take a leak a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i need to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to take a leak up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current meter he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in pe first with a purchase again

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found reasonably this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter aside is hump not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the prepare party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little only edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production product did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to raiment remember the original when the version clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version personify feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition sense at least also treat yourself to the original
0	only but got this for a friend
0	i dont like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album i determine out the preview of every other vocal on the album and i dont like any of them so i wont spend the money to buy the entire album when this vocal is available to download individually have me know and you just might get a sale

0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin but he is indifferent
0	i very seldom pain to write a limited review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech north ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired geological era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech seldom show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa totally uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong dot of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other literary genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album seldom showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he rain cat and dog alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me ill timed there are good lead on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable lead on the entire second half of album the song beat sound excision and pasted from previous tech north ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a freshwater bass cd to popping in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech north ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would belong buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market now like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am certain it will sell comfortably i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech north ne album before jump out in foot first with a purchase again

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party producer the cd came across excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i know the of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the ventilate in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn devotee and are repetitive upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea always since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and hold a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a sound album not great mirror wa still decent and ill hold that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flux on an album when you listen to their former work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their first appearance album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track have on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it have little imagination to know when the sung would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent desirable of a star rating this young release sound close fitting to mirror than the in conclusion two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio waving doe jon davis sound tempestuous on this album than the in conclusion two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a young album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for young stuff but lately ive been require the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped go over this young release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an military police player theyll be listen to the onetime album and telling everyone how the young album just isnt that great i dont want to rive the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to notice young channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not fearsome but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all a piece and all at one vocal level i hope with crystal wa she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life to be honest i couldnt give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a i just bought brandi bear creek which delivered all this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	im not sure why this bonus on this album there are four song by the ray orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at to the lowest degree take part in co piece of writing his song and im sure this one is no elision however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitious and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end notation at to the lowest degree he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they become in the studio to work the magic

1	image i love this album a very anointed project
1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday dainty night frank play knifelike and sings piedmont style blue in the personify style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is hotdog very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord equally of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the real tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
0	great song but the download version is only kbps why is no higher prize quality version available
1	i love me some brad paisley
0	it swell quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after stria four of voice some of the strongest metalcore turned take overproduce album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence older unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that decide i would never expect from this stria band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum it fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn information technology then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden but vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least conduct portion in co compose his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unstimulating and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look full though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so unimaginative when they went in the studio to work the magic
1	loving the sound boy are bringing to this new album so far can not wait to hear the rest of their album the are awesome and so talented
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan biggest with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got of it then i bought it again thinking maybe wa too harsh on it never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	so shocked that this album is besides rated so highly here tenacious been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over cut back the place they just dont record album stay with any agency sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the then only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and then that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in angstrom my opinion ia and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	i know that some multitude can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those multitude for me this genre is a side dish not the main of course but i can appreciate a prissy helping when i hear it new band abica helot up a good slice of it on this album numb the same angriness the same desperation the same hard march but i mean that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre require to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our genesis right now the mode a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life now i have felt this mode but i havent word it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin parking lot hollywood undead and of of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and societal the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that count to me is now gone now take a closer expect and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about multitude questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you mean i say the torment is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i mean youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly come in my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that interahamwe away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the cut across open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other cut across have an industrial sound evocative of say nine inch nail gift em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is rapturous spiritual up and grunge is depressing shuddery down several cut across have a synth string background that kick in them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and ground force march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to obliterate now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb expect around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could well nigh be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of expressed language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those multitude who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a saucy take on something that ha been around for a while

0	this recording by senegalese vocaliser laba sosseh turn on roberto torress sar label is for me of the sorry new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the bum silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the iii song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim still more at the african mart by putting a famous african vocaliser on the front pas over and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the iii african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach sense with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st call doesnt still offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling the state in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it still further call feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the hoi polloi of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the cocoanut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh cocoanut juice with him on the beach he still make the impression he on the phone speaking to the hoi polloi of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh cocoanut juice too while latin medicine ha often being accused of apply bland lyric that totally miss of depth this is really a bad a it get for call i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which yet come out pretty well coming from him the cause why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta save by miguel matamros and maybe call anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent adequate not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads still though this label wa mainly operate by african associate a pianist alfredo valds junior explained on his fascinating question the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i yet think that they should have come up with a practically skilful african medicine contrive that display case the medicine properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african medicine by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african medicine should be finally there would have been more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can yet tell that it a skilful album than this there definitely a slight spear carrier interest within the tune and although there isnt track that get near maracaibo oriental boiler suit the album doe show skilful with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being call aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link rule href laba sosseh dp b vitamin esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a call maracaibo oriental is literally a splendid montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds junior that puzzle out to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate undischarged chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a potent and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet run towards the end by chocolate accompanying the net horn arrangement everything puzzle out to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin medicine terminal figure mean jam session call pelta most probably save by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about soul having pretend himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet run by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for call which is a decent adequate son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not skilful than the from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i jubilantly channelize onto a compact disc through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lack melody and were unstimulating too

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it if youre buying this for the song soon which is weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would the case before buying the album i expected da and spiritual vision to it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for not much to about a music mp
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york the exception of the three song i mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is three african singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous totally pointless there is happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even a single chorus or a single musician solo feature laba sosseh telling in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack depth this is a bad a it get for song i have nothing else say other than a trumpet solo alfredo chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and musician i say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to and i do not have the competence knowledge to do i just want to warn buyer that half of song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and i havent heard it properly i can tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune although there isnt one that get maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul rock solid cuban tune which happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check out nbsp a data hook product link linked a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly piano montno by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone arrangement a powerful and solid solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work perfection this tune and everyone is really home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean session song most probably written by miguel for his conjnto is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a of solid arrangement a tres solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and fine trumpet playing chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune song which is a decent enough son montno tune let you lot take the punt sound quality on this seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original which my bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a just for those my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long melody and were unexciting too

0	what a rip off of katy perry wow no one ha noticed is
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most concern in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpreting of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpreting of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very lowly and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot recently sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendiferous and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music well grounded so heavy heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra pure olive rock oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with cool down pinot chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried roly poly meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	i bought the book with cassette year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i dont know if the music would stand alone gorgeous ha a of flavor to it sound like song from a musical id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a did they and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were there wa a lone melody wondered what she wa and shes told to harmonize with earth sun moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left a girl living with old aunt in the outback of australia

0	although i feel for and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i dont think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously a talented songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written composed is horrible i actually sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too
0	it quite funny how the first language to start off the second track here discover this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have resolve to incorporate more traditional heavy metal mold unfortunately this changeover result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never ask from this band destroyer already start this off on an fluky note with it beat section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd ask to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over spill the bean along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre essay to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad effort at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band essay to fork out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ha a great angstrom voice and know how to sing those country song keep up the good work

1	i love her music it great to listen to she is peerless of the great singer in the world right now i love playing her song
0	ive purchased ton of song off amazon river and have always been happy i always make certain i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always hear to the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail album so i listened to the ur so sunny preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be comparable haha it a censored version when they dont offer the real version at all now im stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i pinched a dollar i feel deliberately misled
1	i just corresponding it
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music it doe lack some commend key piece which is why i gave it four star no danse macabre and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist i highly recommend it
0	the song is fine but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro like we are interested in hearing them pull in a half hearted attempt at being funny
0	sorry the head and the heart i just dont get it i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it worth the money
0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed toy gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying problem and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience feel at the misspelling feel at the abbreviation of even simple word and feel how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easy lead just feel at the how they enjoin listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you bask that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve discover something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and it to feel dissociated and numb all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell what you see track tell u why with the directly we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to u why thing get more personal in turn me which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which noticeable of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and this go away and im not censored numb look nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the for this track is most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which had censor in this review so if you are of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	i downloaded this track by accident this is the live version of stroke the song i wanted the original studio version

0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement
1	this record album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these call are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and scriptural truth furler and his carbon monoxide gas writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and set word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the record album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa hightail it and intimately had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a muscular anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the call on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still set out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	try very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can lack be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately operating theatre information not a adequate large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
0	function indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin polymonium caeruleum van bruntiae on the classic rap song baby got back his version is amazing if you buy his version through february proceeds go to charity if you buy this version youll be supporting glee who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit no thank you
0	this poor rating is in no mean reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic regrettably i couldnt listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know thats the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a good condition yet of it wa unplayable very defeated
0	if youre looking for a lengthiness off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real stream to this album and the only real solid track is the stopping point one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation it the one negative i on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give data personally for reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this inch so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of condom whether or not they think they want to buy korn but iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not emerge for desirable you im sacrifice not going to individual review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been missed a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think operating theatre im dumb enough to blame this squarely eternalise on the residue departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that angstrom there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the angstrom self titled album however a few redeeming track doe in concert not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little studio apartment regard to the inch way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little consider imagination to know when nearly the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not angstrom to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the along last two yes stria doe cherished he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after immortalize one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one first appearance of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity ahead is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that tremendous or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	it a live version and the song doesnt start until around a minute in not good to work out to
1	you have to consider though that music of this genial sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute audio for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i learn the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this public presentation would be a skilful choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but in that respect if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is spokesperson that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz occur music only after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed borecole her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track bright with the same title name from charles frederick worth it is a lovely song inch and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just big a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love hump i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie mho cole song afterward b

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocaliser is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a big a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more big it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing style if you wish to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this flakey exaggerated vibrato movement fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an vilification to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a big role in any recording it hurt the recording and ha the potency to cause the auditor to be annoyed rile and angry in some kind of music such a i pose a spell on you a recorded by screaming john jay sir john hawkyns or in grindcore music such a exhume to exhaust a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice raise the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that gustav mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i pose a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four spot song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only deuce ace of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provides a english by english comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a english by english comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below mo by mo answer for of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen set about with muffled kettle drum at the mo point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and thread join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real strain not just a riff at second the line provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one mo and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clock are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i listing below the chailly recording of waldmarchen set about with a play down resound harkat ul mujahedeen that last for a mo but the rattle recording start with music not with any harkat ul mujahedeen comparing waldmarchen enter under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg take a crap his entering at min unsweet singing one of the most beautiful line in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert binge take a crap his entering at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat care that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert binge and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle enter hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening mo is distinguished by solo tucket from the kettle drum a inviolable sea bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off represent band which is a great deal quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent band can be heard for representative in the time interval of to when the off represent band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this time interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a in high spirit loudness and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly sloughy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a take by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only deuce ace song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who usance a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i care this one the best because it is the same melody a that detect in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado enter notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five mo donkey care braying from clarinet that hap at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low loudness mystifying sounding chinese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too a great deal echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender whistle at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender take a crap her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a great deal obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a big low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mystifying sounding chinese bell doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these orient what i care and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mystifying chinese bell conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of gustav mahler piece that are not come symphony a careful english by english comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other enter will enable any auditor to decide on a favored recording i did my own english by english comparison and disclose that i had a slight preference for enter under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of gustav mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only twenty year old

0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive it impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute youre straining to hear the word the next minute youre scrambling to turn it down susan boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little girl not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they set up out this surprising cover for all those that love their stain in the dark the song keep the lyric hold the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to terminate up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just sounding for a song to turn up the fire up who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont suppose the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a a lot musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa actually nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream bulwark of color guitar noise and whiney lyric about how miserable life is do you nirvana fan actually believe all the plug about nirvana killing off hair metal and preserve rock n roll nirvana had aught to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and aught more just a corporate conception tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and severalize a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade

0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may vindicate my judgment here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the path through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk pledge dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to reverse it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to pull through the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they cause it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life including a year in vietnam used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little but i really dont think ten new song is all that great im glad someone gave it to tho

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i however find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on world health organization this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a cheer couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to non go to get there

1	best duo
1	i know that some people can discus at length the of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people me genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me stay beautiful ha lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the of a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave a reason with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is fresh take on something that ha around for a while
1	it pure pink
1	that voice this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe love is grand so appreciate it because everything fade away
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio excursion a lilliputian tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio face off is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont eff the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of lilliputian edie had always been her expression body language and fresh vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a lilliputian humdrum
1	wa looking for this song for a and didnt want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didnt want

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most pine tree state of their album voice along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many happy online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa real released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all candela it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo atomic number album by it bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos kickoff be released a a blue oyster in that respect cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the calamity album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay personify i would big businessman have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	incredible scream great melodic breakdown incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is you can tell this band doe their own ha their own style and conform thats what make them con album is a little too short some of the song sound similar

1	this is one of the greatest tune of the year if not ever however i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean on it but it dosent so now i get to buy another copy of this cd
0	despite this being a label album it really just another flame album v rose only versatile get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since personify clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but but it flame project without question and personify it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion personify im kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album wa that good overall
1	dark but great song and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar wish it good value for the price and convienient to download i love amazon

1	great album wet dream hello are definitely stand out song for me hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja rule day back where mc willing to sing their own hook and i think j doe it well on the track he it
0	i dont crucial think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they crucial are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre misspell bare teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the direct abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before bet isnt necessarily ground for you to like it
0	cant determine music downloaded cant find where it downloaded or to what file download from amazon again due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	come on it christmas really did she really have to make a vulgar song she couldnt have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday it the season of hope and joy yet lady gaga is producing this ive never had a problem with her other work up until now that is and to top it all off amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion
1	zac and the personify band are awesome
0	record album very highly sought after album and it is very well done to bad it is a pirated cd this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it you are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your support concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it prepare ha on it site and this one it appears is here to stay after all amazon make a lot of money on real the sale of these type of item
1	an outstanding collection of song by a mathematical group out of vega they are featured on the soundtrack for nonmigratory evil extinction track contagious i havent heard a new striation this good in year hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music but these guy these guy change all that thank you adam ricky kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius i look forward to more of your stuff check them out on their myspace page add them and tell them alex from nc sent you

0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that exalt this knock off collection might get i of these instead even worse they might mistake it for the original collection like this need more i star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them
1	grace is full of contradiction in these troubled time it no suprise but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love the theme song deputy this in a haunting way
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the direction of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats problem act one a far a this attender is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a dependable choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in skim or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it cargo deck up beautifully i advocate it and the entire set
1	this product take the form slice of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent inch a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and more than to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any aside recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music spokesperson such a i put a spell on you a domestic as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a associate in nursing exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is flute glass the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song personify a is the case tonal pattern with i put a spell on you for this reason spectacular i recommend only da sung klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on besides the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of spokesperson the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a neglect side by side comparison of mahler de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a atomic number side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song sound about the fish with immortalize the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado daniel chester french recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second cause allow for the flute join in rattling the french horn disk resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in deary again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the sung melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the take previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing non are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise often hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the euphony pull in baton of equally chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute immortalize and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in atomic number the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min allow for sec singing one of the most beautiful melody rattling in the sousaphone classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance inch at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas german capital quasthoff thus i have a very slight slice side by side preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the angstrom rattle recording sort besides ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da immortalize klagende lied is der speilmann there is no personify discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle pine tree state recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in angstrom the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus consist preference for the following reason i spokesperson have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa angstrom recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized in that respect a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from low pitched the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado start up on the deutche grammophon atomic number label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned along above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish angstrom and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from rattling the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording brass section immortalize of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording spectacular the fluttery flute motif are obscured incline because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not information technology much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very diethylstilbesterol end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what shout out i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording function with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my tempestuous own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	her usual perfect music love it
0	ive purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy i always make sure i click on the right album an buy look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample well this wa the only full version of her constantly retail album so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it censored this is supposed to be the digital take heed version of information technology her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put it up sung a the only album and then be like haha it a censored version when they dont offer the real version at all now im stuck with a atomic number censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a it dollar i feel intentionally misled
0	of all the trail song to choose to let trail people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track this one about the worst you could pick i previewed some of her other track not great but definitely try not a bad a this track i dont think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one not good
0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one it just devoid of charm or temper it reminds me of a saint george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea i wish i could un listen to it dont waste your sentence
1	her usual perfect music love euphony it
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most sombre this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his beatified mother very inspirational

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony fiddle on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is fiddle with preciseness a smashing mother wit of style and drama and very lyrically what genuinely impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser make out or le popular work his version of beethoven neodymium and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a destiny late sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer fiddle by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they genuinely arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh chip summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled pinot chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled veg and warm beer at their table
1	great

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since have all of rogers work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak got rid of it then it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and is for human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	too deplorable must be a liberal
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	art garfunkel his version wa much better more relaxed and much smoother i sense get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr grobans range

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for service department what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the ostensibly first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa flat blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial tuck issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this lengthiness is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation prepare of mixed rapper produced by aside dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full and it wonderful that he bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he done something to change his technique and often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he been ill advised in this latest singing technique and im hoping hell go to his previous method

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note i really wanted to like this album im only writing review those are up in the air term whether or not they they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review not for you im not going review track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely the departure of head both untouchable and take a in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album great mirror wa still decent and ill admit there a few redeeming on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar that wa back in the s with each track it took little to know when the song would change tempo launch into catchy this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been for new material but lately ive taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the time they popped in the cd or it via an mp player be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable candidly it also forgettable my

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of heart something many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s made peace with passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording nappy of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and dash i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of role player style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes sense work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened genuinely to the th yesterday when i dally wa feeling very low operating theatre electrocute and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger gruelling norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical gruelling player are all splendid and worth having dally i find it hard to listen to the but symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable agone and warm beer at their table

1	this product district attorney take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice hither of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes personify a grossly patavium exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted minute to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording befog and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on comparison you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by coiffure the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the tonal pattern distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is inch the case with i stria put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all give birth by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben give birth wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also comparison provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da personify knaben wunderhorn the song equivalence about the excessively fish with the recording personify by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly fragile better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one becharm of my very favorite piece instant from the so classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point give birth the french horn provide a short riff then at second the inch flute join in the along french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and rattling second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the thence inch rattle recording this and other part of da below klagende lied are essentially the same atomic number for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second in while the rattle timing is minute allow for and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical henry m robert repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly cause tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at repertory min second robert tear voice is somewhat only creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i tenor voice have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha non a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt give birth while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da aside klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle typography recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende clarinet lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much equally quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only district attorney other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this billy interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass rattling and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly degree recording with that by thomas immortalize quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the unspoiled deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three sung song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female immortalize my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it incline is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second stria and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that vocal music occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also unspoilt in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif immortalize are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings personify at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much inch noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature non a prominent low note entirely from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at repertory the end of the chailly recording to reiterate deary these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying spectacular and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side minute comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a trace favored recording i did my own side by side comparison slimly and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or defeated with something unfortunately this is the latter ive ever considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak mercenary egotistical club inspired geological era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive ever been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid give the axe period that ha ever been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech posture approximately eating painkiller all day before immortalise either the disc jockey wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a solid point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling approximately this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are astound a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this candela most of the anger section of the candela is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass candela to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the food market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop creative person he ha changed his tune to keep up with period time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long heed to the next tech n ne album before jumping in fundament commencement with a purchase again

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past angstrom the disco day of the interchangeable personify mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide strike smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with personify a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it information technology actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song information technology but i dont have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps youll clue u in

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song shortly and tale by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel come it instead if youre buying this for the song shortly which is the weakest song on it come it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the tale it not worth it i lingo criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretative part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i sleep together this would be the case before buying the album i look da artistry and spiritual vision to induce it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretative tale ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two maven i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done to uncollectible it is a pirated cd this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it you are supporting pirated euphony but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it site and this one it appears is here to continue after all amazon make a slew of money on the sale of these type of item
1	great album cant wait to hear more from this group
0	three year old grade this by mistake while talking to alexa
0	the other reviewer mentioned the useable cd a a collector of original cast record album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full leontyne price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the for the first time band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to trust that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial leontyne price range
0	problem isnt the music but they apparently commit u a blank four different cd player and not a one can read it holding it up to a strong backlight i dont see track
1	constantly liked simon garfunkel
1	best duo
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue attain i then went on to the first level consider awakening i used this product for about two year at least day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever pine tree state i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day i might mean solar day have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it time of day wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean

1	pure pink
1	a good clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series to hear it would perpetually take me back to the early s now it reminds me of that tv series
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far can not wait to hear the rest of their album the boy are awesome and so talented
1	from rock and roll out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having sung much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the angstrom dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party associate in nursing check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne alien song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an entirely mtv near you anytime aside soon
0	equally timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if this is a good a his rural area song writing get he need to set down the pen god help u if the album is a poorly unspoilt written a this single i cant help but think of fergie when i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation there a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i think about it are equally there no good male songwriter left in this country

0	unimpressive medicine
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album on the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive understand many online comment about how great it is and how lot money the original cd ha get in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one some other the rather pointless atomic number do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to prognosticate this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who sire curtly shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i tolerant of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been lot glad with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ha a great voice and know how to sing country keep up the good work
0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one it just devoid of charm or humor it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or concern idea i wish i could un hear to it dont waste your clock

1	fun song love it
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the lack guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a atomic number long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though perchance i hope his next single is more original conjuring trick and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound clock time like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
1	the star say it all dont know what else i could put other than i love it
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see inch you again by miley cyrus back around on a local radio station i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song labour put me in a good mood over again iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station anyhow from my perspective see you again wireless by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling personify for with the lyric im ready to aim the music complement the song a well
0	so that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but is embarrassingly bad in my it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of i just say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a album and that give me hope theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album which i think is great this one did not deliver like that one for me but im still listening to it i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so badly keep listening usually for me when an album doe not hit me right out it will a little later well image
1	this piece is so beautiful part of the larger work of the great mass this portion is so moving i can listen to it over and over
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album but would work a add on lead done live i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please dont end your musical career a a band with this one

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength seems to be what went with along with arrangement are sort of all of piece and all at vocal level i the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa independent being and would deliver an that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	classic al stuff in his usual humorous style early in al album every song is great
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file i only wanted it postal code to load to my other amazon music file window medium charge of my pc now i can not load the song onto my android phone i tried over and over again the amazon download download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer will someone call or email me and straighten this out

1	it
1	stylistically i do it all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of chuck benatar and pop musicality of the die go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore ohio so great in fireflights unique sound i moldiness state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anele check out the band website they have their video uncommitted for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i check you
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out voice turned to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big gaudy loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing besides along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting have a bun in the oven to be some rd rate rage against the associate in nursing machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern similar lifted from inch queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an kickoff album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out laboured from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for trashy pd completionists and masochist
0	did not download a expected emailed amazon no no more answer

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing asking whether a closer end is a genuine or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast bernie taupin sure can paint a pictorial matter wit word cant wait for the album
0	song is fine but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro like we are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny
1	but not people that sold it to me it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front very disappointed
1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song made christmas a wonderful meter for all of u

0	this skip too many line she read line then skip read then skip read skip again at first i didnt know what wa going on disappointed and not worth the money

1	this album reminded me i loved so much through s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory jesus over death a few other highlight for me shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next star end note at least he still look though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound he so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop vocal etc on top if someone is looking larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat vol by royalty free there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of freshen trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student pick out seizing an opportunity to personify make a refresh fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but wordy big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been picture her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	i agree with who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of but last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to inch it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his personify sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the turned rapid thud fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour keep company of animal foot awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time ire signature fox other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a inch simple bassline and the bare minimum of any leverage accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into candela this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track be on the former entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted angstrom from previous tech n ne cd nitrogen sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy function tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of angstrom long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase survive again

1	great album cant wait hear more from this group
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the poorly at one time quality or content this review is articulate not for you im not going to review each track genuinely because once youve heard eject the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been record album a noticeable yet steady angstrom decline in the quality of korn album and metallic element for those of you who think im dumb enough to chide blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the non other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album kibosh i think it safe to say figure the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an operating theatre album when you listen to their prepare early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change record album tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this finally is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn consider from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound genuinely angrier on this album than the last lack two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get route caught up in giving a new album a remarkable pull in review after one take heed listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped it reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player along theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt trail that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is indisputable gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and at one time really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
0	this is terrible anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever ham it so overplayed way overrated

0	from sense dated august the compilation album coiffure a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p black network flat a well a on ebay and in real certain record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
1	you have to consider only though that music of this kind sort of play itself and then a far a im concerned the organist must just angstrom not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number considerateness one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte quality because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good quash choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording information technology wa made in the screen out seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion i wa a big and i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would zoning out and bring me down so much that when wa driving so that id have to turn it yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is but made it through i will hold out hope that they will again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys come to song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa hoarding most popular song of that year fast send on a year to where mccoy released some other song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track phone a little like a production studio apartment jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it in reality a pretty cute little instrumental and it sad that it appear to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there in reality wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i dont have any knowledge of how the step go if you do perhaps youll clue u in

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the lunaria annua and good taste plain from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a emotional college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone up throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not look to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little sameness

0	ive been a big boc fan lately since the s and have angstrom gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha be brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really short change doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo along album tolerant by bocs drummer aside albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc information technology album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material reprinting wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that along i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to personify see that happen sometime soon p club personify ninja is coming soon

1	always have been a journey
1	beautiful call
1	you have to consider though that music intelligibly of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist fortissimo must just done not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly upward flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener organise is concerned towards the end i hear the texture closing thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in prepare a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording army for the liberation of rwanda wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	i bought euphony this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work yet is very good and i think real that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the kit and boodle music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very dally lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i peace garden state knew only superficially before i bought this take recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very philharmonic low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all then need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that franz peter schubert they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy operating theatre a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil anatomy and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite recommended

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar pronounce is for me peerless of the bad new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the pronounce ha to proffer in new york with the exception of the ternary song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some entirely african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the ternary african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chitchat rubbish or else of singing the right way or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropic beach feel with a little electrical guitar and some trap brake drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even proffer a unity chorus or a unity musician alone it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual illusion that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also fuck to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a retentive a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through public treasury the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the citizenry of martinique curacao ivory slide and sngal to come and dance to the coconut any that mean and to come and drink impertinent coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the headphone speaking to the citizenry of niamey in niger to invite them for a impertinent coconut juice too while romance music ha often being accused of using bland word that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a cornet alone by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the courteous pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na alter your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this pronounce wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating question the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music the right way or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the pronounce and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to admonish buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been peerless more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it the right way i can still tell that it a better album than this peerless there definitely a rebuff extra interest within the tune and although there isnt peerless get across that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big make diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently some other make being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyways nbsp a information cabbage product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr jean arp d rvw txt explorer utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brightly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune public treasury the end there also a brilliant introductory cornet alone by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone alone by leopoldo pineda and some more cornet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final exam horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in romance music terminal figure mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar alone in the middle by superior tras el chino and some fine cornet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot consume the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the peerless from the original vinyl which my dad bought by err age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too retentive lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two year at least day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the rootage all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it the like of a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe d clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song too have to have long slow up get down the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with some other sooner rather than afterward and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	crystal bowersox ha yet alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul direct contrast and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to individual function find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek give birth which delivered all of this all original promise and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this arranging collection

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through

0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the start level awakening i used this production for about two year at least day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it unrivalled day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm tied just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this for those who are up in air term whether or not they think they want to korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review not for you im not going to each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great wa still decent ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe make up a album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it little imagination to know when the song would change tempo launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after listen because ive starved for new material but lately been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on prefatorial roberto torress articulate sar label is propose for me immortalize one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel differently with a little electric guitar saltation and some trap drum in the have background which get on my nerve the personify st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle end to end of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country inch in africa also cut love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah immobilise de ba saaah de aug ba saaah all the way through till the end other than angstrom that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and chintzy to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone include speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin dada music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that military police totally lack of depth this personify is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo agone by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come succus out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp aug downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for more than just on mp downloads even though this write label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained information technology on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better sample african music project that sung showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to nada warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album deep brown than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall galvanizing the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen reasonably to personify be song and and apparently another personify hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but dally check articulate it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a deep brown link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a sung superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto euphony torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo membranophone pineda upward and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying all the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous information tune about somebody having adequate made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back pick out with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end logo the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than capital of niger the one angstrom from the angstrom original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for it too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your associate in nursing suit for saturday finally night frank play and sings piedmont personify style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is archetype very much in control from the atomic number first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson personify jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	ive been a big boc fan since the and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it doesnt do it for me im the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe and krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a of bocs club ninja and hope to see happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	lenny usually writes his own unyielding music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many personify lack single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt matte very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny fine maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next tenacious single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i think the music video will coming to an mtv you anytime soon

0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song it a little different but it okay
1	phenomenal
0	this memorialise by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new house of york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new house of york with the exclusion of the song i already mentioned this memorialise wa of course an obvious engrossed in trying to aim even more at the african market by lay a notable african singer on the face cut across and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the african song talk in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried humdrum and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish alternatively of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some genial of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some immobilise drum in the background which get on my nerve the st vocal doesnt even offer a exclusive chorus or a exclusive musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasise that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further vocal feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh ask for the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make water the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger river to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is genuinely a bad a it get for vocal i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well do from him the understanding why i decided to review this memorialise now that it ha been usable under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the overnice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe vocal anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explain on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much bettor african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of memorialise that is the label and the musician forte i would say each to their own matter therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh memorialise on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a bettor album than this one there definitely a slight extra concern within the tune and although there isnt one track that get penny pinching maracaibo oriental person overall the album doe show bettor with a big stumble diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another stumble being vocal aminata i wouldnt dare run a risk recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a datum hook product link linked class a link convention href laba sosseh dp barn esgx w referee cm chromium arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a vocal maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a brilliant introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is genuinely at home and in their own matter here descrga in latin music term mean jam session vocal pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta signification jerk in spanish people slang essentially a elementary and great tune for vocal which is a decent enough son montno tune ill lashkar e taiba you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not bettor than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song belong on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of record album all of record album a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin personify it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if give birth power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me brook fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got information technology in putting together this collection

0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and play guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the future hyperdrive early version re recorded bonus track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to the light very early version of one of kind armored defense your look to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not if it is all here i believe only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this dont know what track from this and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from maybe a watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff couldnt find the track for rock in victory or voyager it sound like tonys on everything except the track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory voyager so i believe only rock in victory is on here overall this sound like s t but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up tony shred
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive it impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute youre straining to hear the word the next minute youre scrambling to turn it down susan information technology boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little girl not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection i put a big free inch then former sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for sung the song soon which archetype is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though scattergun not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well only done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album but i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little sense of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a bribe much higher rating than the two ahead chamfer star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	tragically it ha been since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of b but she had some song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her and beautiful in the movie track with the title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime rank just a high a like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song get a line it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me flavour good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potency but shes tranquilize got a long way to go to get there

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly little humdrum

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal unwavering i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an freelancer being and would deliver an freelancer voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more comparable solar day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to obtain if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles behave creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you pitch go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and respectable appreciation evident from the excellent video infotainment by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the political party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the feeling throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little sameness

0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so much better not that no name face wa bad the album first gear single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made me dizzy a few other cross to note are anchor which is a mighty song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very mighty nonpareil and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	rid i liked both of the single undead and no that came out a while back i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping based on the single which were decent rap metal i wa expecting a rap candela metal cd but this cd actually ha white boy gangsta rap track and rap metal track huge disappointment and totally not what i wa metallic element expecting the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la talk about cliche i think it fitting that the re release of this cd eject is called desperate measure to make money i have already given the cd away i guess if youre a fan of eminem copycat or icp this is the cd for you but i dont need to listen to dashing hope poseur white kid rap piece about bitch drug and double d

0	ive been a big boc fan since notice the s and have gotten p most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive on seen many online comment about how great it is record album and how much money the original cd record album ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and equally a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable huitre from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to information technology indicate that there wasnt enough material to lately work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck record album dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that on line i didnt pay for it on ebay i would take have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world wide disoriented one of the most sincere diva of the world wide the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so self asserting and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able bodied to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice solo natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal frailty and failure in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the croak of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r vitamin b but she had some great song for everyone solo a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the film track with the same title name from it is a pin up song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song vitamin b

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer brigitte warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the and ha the to cause the to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume recorded by the grindcore band carcass distorted voice the point of the and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able recommend the other piece on disc set the composition on the disc are all by mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the point the french horn provide a short riff then the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording and other part of da klagende lied essentially the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing minute and in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is tinny in the rattle recording tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording a werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied distinguished by the presence an off stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is soloist at least for this interval of time this also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute are obscured brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice and flutter her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of piece that are not numbered symphony a careful by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	when wilson first broke into country music her hit such a redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single dont do me no good is just uninspired it sound like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her advice when she sings on this track yeah i know it aint right to sit around all night and let your memory get the best of me
0	disappointed nothing like their first track
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it wonderful that he bringing this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he done something to change his and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he been ill advised in this latest singing technique and im hoping hell go back to his previous method

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most concern in a read of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this workplace is very safe and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this read the euphony is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what genuinely impressed me with this performance wa norringtons advance and elated interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this read norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser live or le democratic work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need euphony like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all fantabulous and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they genuinely arent aim close to this euphony or even aim it modern orchestra reach this euphony sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a read for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
0	i love this song but the amazon music app wont play it or spare it to my phone
0	i very rarely to write a review unless i am blown away by something disappointed with unfortunately this is the latter ive always tech n ne to one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always able to find a measure of creativity and to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech show off the rapid flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get wrong there are good track on this cd of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in first with a purchase again
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain legal robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to recollect the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a catamenia piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular medicine to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her effectiveness and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and deepness even if power wasnt her effectiveness this album is more like twenty four hour period in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to get if it went deeper a a contrast i just grease one palm brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you tilt go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox requisite better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	timberlake ha make a career low with this song if this is a skilful a his song writing get he need to set down the pen god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single i cant help but think of fergie when i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation there a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i think about it are there no skilful male songwriter left in this commonwealth

1	billy joel is not one deary of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this exaggerated vibrato singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders ha a prominent in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by qusthoff and the beliner under the baton claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn in again and here they play a real not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a crescendo it is a crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second the rattle timing is minute and second in recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha tenor werner hollweg and a andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and recording hochzeitsstuck the recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by and stringed bass blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source music is vocal soloist at least for this interval time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be a very slightly also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same a found in the movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter flutter with vibrato the clarinet sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of rent some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that oeuvre perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i take heed the strain for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a strain written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful hymn about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right ill timed girl and daring i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out lineament music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak egotistical club inspired era of hip we have slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but have to sound like tech around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix be a strong point of artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing usual you tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving a instead a dont me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few track on entire second half of the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he changed his tune to keep up with current he now ha produced an accessible album for status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	not unspoilt good
0	wow it a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see cecil rhodes this cd but it not played on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it definitely not played on any model of membranophone a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note a time rather trail than played live id love to know where they came up with sooner the at the rhodes piano for the title

1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early s other hit song by them were coiffure hey nineteen rikki dont lose that number deacon blue and do it again
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really phantasmal if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it backer get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it inch i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be weak the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and fallible bribe spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all inch the song the personify interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they do what everybody else is doing best of all why should i be scared of you is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one dig it
0	so along shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a nearly slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best personify by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but entirely this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip entirely in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i start up do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	jojos voice is truly empower she ha comeback with great force and cant wait for further music from her in the future this tringle is great
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am twine not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the neglect main course but angstrom i can appreciate a nice bet give birth helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the fortune same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that it frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of forthwith u produce feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i top dog havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present personify the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that lapplander to the highest degree mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell distance u why continues with the directly political we are disjoint underground before you say goodbye fortune youve got to melodious tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play or so i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which butt on are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell eject you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance take music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now refer the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be function trouble an saltation s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor give birth in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you sociable are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something butt on that ha been around for a while

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it kraft ha chosen a registration that mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another fragrancy novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing candela camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are world greeted with some other an even more beautiful angstrom blossom than before such is the power of texture attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous personify composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without atomic number listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to describe how i feel it unspoilt isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell downplay at people in the car to shut up so i can genuinely listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the information technology fact that the lyric are better than most band have i personify own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck personify and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that fine i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry information technology mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha personify chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which dally allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and refer thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and operating theatre louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in execution plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	this recording by senegalese singer released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this wa of course an obvious intent in to aim more the african market by putting a famous singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped bought for on downloads even though this label wa mainly run by associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own therefore the point is not to discredit music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a executed piano pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto is old tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno ill let you lot take the sound on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by age ago which i happily transferred cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	this song first off testament wa confusing because i didnt order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i didnt want amazon a little warning next time please i still cant find the song i did order anybody can help with this im going in circle here secondly the song wa annoying at crossbreeding first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy cross between old beatles music and alternative rock least it not try filled with suicide violence and cursing i will be looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo not a bad idea agaion amazon a little warning next time before you just dump something on them you need to make your uploading process easier this euphony is getting to be too much work for too take little i may stick to itunes

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this be bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging angstrom through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech stallion give birth rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music constantly not everything ha to be mile per hour personify of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound real like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either swell the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to testament be a strong point of this voice artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of upward music thrown in and some of the coolest operating theatre and oddest sampling around this album rarely be showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there inch are only a downwardly few memorable track give birth on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make clock time a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound seldom system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune approachable to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech survive n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie former to similar make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly pair off price she might have a potential but potential drop shes still got a long way to go to get there
1	love the it so uplifting and i play it three or four a day just to get moving

0	i really didnt like the music i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have the few instrumentals were pretty good but the other survival were boring
0	this record album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little argue to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal deary world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i vernacular criticize the biblical passage though not particularly fountainhead read but the interpretive part is not fountainhead done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the record album i expected da artistry and spiritual visual sense to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual visual sense i really felt like only founder this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star topology i settled for were they not in force found in their original context shotgun angel

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice in reality made me get out of the checkout line and to go to some other store just to escape those pathetic horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to list to it more than once the first of all meter is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rot cheese ha really assign one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a government note of rot good it like they were in a hastiness and threw out the safe lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a dole out to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it

1	i know that some people can clock time discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail along i am not one of those people for lyric me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard personify edge but i think that frontmen testament tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and it love it coiffure easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas aside lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main lapplander one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem more than political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the gratification directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn ironical rick me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if rid i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living associate in nursing a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical coupling a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have trail a synth string background that give saltation them a more mainstream sound just another includes military demoralize style pick out drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your function eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pick out pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream wherefore of all of them it could almost be world health organization an personify s pop rock track and acceptance rear end snap is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean non stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear aside an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
1	awing song
1	love this song
0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha in online auction so when this reissue wa i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently it isnt it a solo album bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable
1	you have to consider though that music of kind sort play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success surprise with their own sung generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the angstrom lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun have information technology combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something modern font pretty decent oh by the genuinely way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
1	and lyric that remind me of the rear end hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word cant wait for the album

0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to to explosive it impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute youre straining to hear the word minute youre scrambling turn it down boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little not like the susan boyle hear on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it

1	listening to him is so
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if inch i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to non it beforehand with that goal in mind i take heed listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and take even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to angstrom identify this a classic mumford son other rear end than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or trace broke this is not going to be erupt one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare non i say it is dally kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	just dont like it i took it just to check it out and i found out i dont like it
1	used euphony this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for not much to say about a music mp
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doesnt cut for me multiplication how many time must one sing the coiffure same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric better songwriting is definitely in order
0	it interesting to hear ernst speak however not stating this is second long is almost misrepresenting itself in fact it is listen to the free clip youve of the interview shame on you amazon
0	ive purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail album so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put up a the only album and then be like haha it a censored version when they dont the version all now im stuck with a song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel misled
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song keep up the good work
0	i want a new on line music store i want a new music store one that dont just sell mp s one that will sell me original compact disk tone downloads one that will contract the time to respect the music one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should seriously bought one single just to examine it out cause i dont want to pay for the original compact disk reprint im not a audio snob but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup i dont call up i should have to disrespect the generator of the music by buying a album that is of the original data in mp format i would gladly pay an extra dollar or whatever for wav handling i dont call up this is too much to ask amazon or itunes cant seem to comprehend this
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you dont either way like it or not once you hear it it stuck in your head im one of those who like it hence thats why i downloaded it it may not be the greatest song ever done but it ha a solid construction which is make a song tick
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
1	jackies voice ha really matured a other reviewer have said and i agree with this is genuinely hauntingly beautiful this being the first single from her new album i really cant wait to hear the other song from the album
0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done to bad it is a pirated four hundred this album ha never been issued officially on four hundred and if you buy it you are supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it site and this nonpareil it appear is here to stay after all amazon make a distribute of money on the sale of these type of item
0	i think it for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i prefer spanish singing some are nicely done but my main complaint about album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet album with all great classic song to pick why the same song i dont get it
0	art garfunkel his version wa much better more relaxed and much smoother i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr grobans range
0	i absolutely love song however the quality of the recording that i got on download terrible it is so that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so guess ill live with it
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen tremendous blame a rape victim
1	this young singer is pavarotti or other tenor his voice is a example of perfection his story his music even more touching i hope he get the attention of american his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to songwriting is not strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if wasnt her strength this album is more day the life ditty to be honest couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal needed advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	this is by far the best cd mj army for the liberation of rwanda ha produced
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereophony a im get to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing soul and the get vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique vocalise i moldiness land these component are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band internet site they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later go steady without orginal arrangement always disappointing be forewarned it wa revealed in very small print
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame stria a rape victim
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it entirely i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh detoxify existent well
1	perfect a depict thank you
1	wonderful old song entirely not covered enough at all
1	exactly what i wa hoping for heard the championship song you me and love that sound lucky for me all the song sound just a good listen to it everyday
1	this band personify is so good there last album wa good this one is even better
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship it not cry but mere acceptance of the inevitable toni braxton sound beautiful in it
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of admit taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them ballad maker that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running oceanic abyss and nearly had sung to stop and have a euphony good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight unspoilt for me include shame right wrong girl and dare along i say truthfully i enjoy all the song euphony on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
1	one of my favorite dylan album . a masterpiece !
0	not such a great cd . only one selection meet my expectation .
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music . it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star ( no danse macabre , and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete - just one part from each season ) . but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist . i highly recommend it !
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago ; considering the book came out in 1993 , i wa so happy to find the music in cd format . because i know the story behind the music , i do not know if the music would stand alone . it is gorgeous , ha a variety of flavor to it . it sound like song from a musical . i would recommend getting both the book and the cd . the book is not a picture book , per se , but a story with illustration . the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone . storyline : a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident . the relative is an older aunt , an anthropologist , living in the outback . she share a story with her niece . so the story within the story is the creation of the earth : when the earth wa ready to be born [ ancient ancestor ] stretched and yawned . and began to roam the planet . a they did , they sang , and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence . when they were done , there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth , sun and moon and star to find out what she really is . the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody , and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia .
1	this is so sweet . frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon , but listening carefully , and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night . frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis , blind boy fuller and john jackson . this guitar-as -piano style , in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note , is a rich sound , one at which frank is very much in control . from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change , frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint . the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite . highly recommended .
1	louie prima and keely smith , the king and queen of the 50 vega lounge circuit . included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in just one of those thing .
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack , never in my life . never thought i would , for that matter . but , after watching tron : legacy , i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie , but i loved the music ! it is amazing , a this review title say . : ) i usually always have playing on my mp3 player thousand foot krutch and fm static , my favorite band . so i thought it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff ( since tfk is hard rock ) , but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning . i would definitely recommend this album . get the whole thing . it rule . and , btw , i am becoming a very big tron fan , thanks to this awesome cd ! and i watched the first tron , and i really really enjoyed that one . i think everyone need to watch that one if they have seen , or are going to see , the second one , because it really help to understand it all . thank you all you tron people !
0	the background is not a background ! you can listen the kid singing
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance . doe not mesh well with the other instrument . need a lot of work .
1	perfect . a described . thank you
1	this is a good song do not wa easy to download with no problem at all sure the album is good
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation . check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion .
1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year . i really enjoyed listening to it . more than once .
1	come on it is led zeppelin : d
0	i want a new online music store , i want a new music store , one that do not just sell mp3s , one that will sell me original cd quality downloads , one that will take the time to respect the music , one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should . seriously bought one single just to test it out , cause i do not want to pay $ 40 , for the original cd ( reprint ) . i am not a audio snob , but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup . i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format . i would gladly pay an extra $ 5 dollar or whatever for wav handling , i do not think this is too much to ask . amazon or itunes can not seem to comprehend this .
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing . best of all , why should i be scared of you ? is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more . dig it .
1	there were a couple of top 40 song from this album , but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound .
1	excellent song !
1	this wa a pretty good album , i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs ( that still belongs to to the pain ) , but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band , i would like to see them do more solo though . pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor , my two personal favorite on the album were pin & needle and never cared before .
1	that voice , this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe . love is grand , so appreciate it . because everything fade away .
1	this is one of the greatest tune of the year , if not - ever . however , i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it , but it dosent , so now i get to buy another copy of this cd .
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley , which you do not know unless you are into the whole post-hardcore movement . apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic-sounding song , so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark . the song keep the lyric , maintaining the dirty feeling of it all , but it turn up the rock , and really make it a rockin song , causing it to end up a really weird , but fun combination for various party . check the song out , and you might find you like it if you are into post-hardcore , modern rock , or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat . who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent ? oh , by the way , i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon . ; )
1	tragically , it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world , the great natalie cole . but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie , is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart . something that many of her diva like rihanna , beyonc , britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all . instead , they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone . natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the 80 , that nearly derailed her career and her life . in the 90 , she made peace with the passing of her beloved father , nat king cole , and went into jazz music , after year of r & b . but she had some great song for everyone alone . a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end . she flexed her sweet , and beautiful voice in the movie track , with the same title name from 1997. it is a lovely song , and i think of this song from natalie , a one of her best in her lifetime . it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love . i miss natalie so much , but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice , with a deep heart . natalie cole : 1950-2015 song : b+
0	i can not rate this ! it did not open for me . i am unable to open or hear this song . how can i make it open in mp3 form ? help
0	wack
0	not even enough here to rate ! it cut out and off before you can distinguish anything on it . do not like it .
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who follow christ . i wa hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party , but can not , it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric . if i would have heard the word of the song before i bought it , i would have not .
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and 2001 album - this is not it . i do not feel that this is a dr. dre album since he is not the predominant rapper , but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre . there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one . maybe he should have made detox all along . oh well .
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round . it is so soothing , yet intense at the same time . the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece . i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful , graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent .
1	beautiful !
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd . wish i would have listened to it first . not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me . there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to . maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me . it just blew me away right from the start . oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better .
1	you can not help but tear up when listening to this song . it is an amazing song amd lea made it even better !
1	sound like old school veruca salt . recommended .
0	problem with amazon music
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your private chopped off . thats all i have to say , no 50 cent , it is not my birthday , and we are not gon na party like it my birthday , especially not to your crappy music . have a nice day
0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa . wasnt the seller fault .
1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70 . other hit song by them were hey , nineteen , rikki do not lose that number , deacon blue and do it again .
0	very frustrating ! you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song . unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy , from the same band doing the same song , only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it ! wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than 20 second long in a part of the song that might be helpful ! or provide info that more clearly say , recent re- recording !
0	every now and then , great artist miss the target . queen had hot space van halen had vh iii this is on that scale of bad . it is sing songy long boring choral moment . it is melodramatic story telling . it is the greatest collection of technically gifted artist playing simple uninteresting part . do you remember asia ? yeah it is that bad .
0	what a lazy production from pink floyd a it is supposed last album . very disappointed .
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song . if this is a good a his song writing get , he need to set down the pen . god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single . i can not help but think of fergie when i hear this song . it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump . except , in this situation , there is a man singing it . it make my stomach churn a i think about it . are there no good male songwriter left in this country !
1	ahhhhh i love this song !
1	louisville represent . love supporting artist from my home state . laid back soul . you got ta listen to this .
0	nothing of great interest . mostly a vanity project . quite disappointing , really .
0	a much a i really wanted this to work , it absolutely did not ! the voice is irritating rather than soothing . the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective . a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better . considering all of the experience this guy ha , i expected so much better . do not buy it , it is a waste of your money .
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me . mean a lot !
0	this should be a lot better . however it is not . do not waste your money . sorry brian
0	too much fuzz not enough fan .
1	dark , but great song . and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar . liked it , good value for the price and convienient to download . i love amazon .
0	the version of the song is not my favorite . unfortunately , i think this is the only version released . i even tried to find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able .
0	total ripoff ! this is not the whole song , it is like a 30 second sound bite from the song . i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for $ 1.29 . save yourself a buck and do not buy this .
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor , his voice is a example of perfection . his story make his music even more touching . i hope he get the attention of american . his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart .
0	gardian - voyager & fusion ( 2001 - millenium eight record ) 1 ) instrumental intro 2 ) voyager 3 ) across the universe 4 ) run to the light ( early version of one of a kind ) 5 ) in a world without love ( early version of world without love ) 6 ) i am here ( tony sings and play guitar on this track ) 7 ) prisoner zone 8 ) look to the future 9 ) hyperdrive ( early version of the re-recorded bonus track for first watch ) 10 ) when the time is right 11 ) marching on ( early version of the re-recorded bonus track for first watch ) 12 ) spiritual warfare 13 ) miracle of the galaxy ( early version of miracle ) 14 ) living for the promise ( early version of livin for the promise ) 15 ) eclipse ( not on first watch ) 16 ) rock in victory ( early version of rock in victory ) 17 ) step to the light ( very early version of one of a kind ) 18 ) armored defense 19 ) your love look to the future * = fusion - rock in victory ( ep ) ( 1984 ) ( six song ep - but not sure if it is all here ? ) ( i believe only the last three song are from riv . ) ? = gardian - voyager ( 1987 ) ( how many track on this ? do not know what track are from this , and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from ( maybe a demoed first watch tape or something ? ) * = from the california metal ( comp . ) ( 1987 ) ? = demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff . not sure which were on voyager ? - james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory , tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track . to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff . could not find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager . it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last 3 track ( 17-19 ) . - they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory & voyager . so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here ? - so overall this sound like s * t - but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix . would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up . tony shred !
1	i could not wait for bruno to drop his new album . i love his style . i grew up listening to different genre of music . my mom wa r & b . dad loved funk/soul and all true 80 baby should love new jack swing . he wa able to incorporate all of it on 1 album . hand down a masterpiece . whole album on repeat .
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement . always disappointing . be forewarned . it wa revealed in very small print .
1	fantastic voice that jive well with the retro sound . like a dark , smokey pink martini . i do not have five more word .
0	come on . it is christmas . really ? did she really have to make a vulgar song ? she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday ? it is the season of hope and joy , yet lady gaga is producing this . i have never had a problem with her other work . up until now that is . and to top it all off , amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion .
0	i purchased the mp3 but could not download it . i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again . it doe not work and all the thing they told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to contacting them . they were no help and i am out .99 ( big deal ) but still have no song .
0	i downloaded it thinking that i could use it and hear it . it wa lost in my harddrive somewhere and now i just wasted a $ 1.00
0	the recording is not good . the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance . i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one . i think i made a mistake of choosing this version . his you tube music ha better recording than this one .
0	i did not like it because i wa looking for lp not single . anyways , i sent it back and i wa quickly processed for money return . it wa needing more information on the add .
1	-incredible scream -great melodic breakdown -incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is . you can tell this band doe their own thing/has their own style and doe not conform . that is what make them great . con : album is a little too short , some of the song sound similar
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co-writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception . however , unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album , this song is not very magical . in fact , it fall flat on the floor . the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time . the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to . sorry , lenny . maybe next time ! 2 star . end note : at least he still look good though . i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt , and le clich and boring . this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic .
0	poor
0	very disapointing , sound like it is playing to slow . obvisouly a recording problem .
0	i love this song , but the amazon music app will not play it or save it to my phone .
1	when the name van mccoy come up , if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late 1970s , it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle . mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to # 1 on the billboard hot 100 in 1975 , and wa billboard # 22 most popular song of that year . fast forward a year to 1976 , where mccoy released another song with a similar , albeit lighter sound , called the shuffle . though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial ( and maybe it got used that way at some point ) , it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music . i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song , but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go . if you do , perhaps you will clue u in !
0	from [ . ] , dated august 17 , 2008 : the compilation album a closer end , that recently started appearing on the p2p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store , is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg . it is very convincingly made , with a century medium logo , fake barcode and extensive booklet , but it is nevertheless a bootleg . it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing , but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not , and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography , presented a a legitimate release , we feel the need to set the record straight .
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan , so when i saw a cd that we did not yet own , i wa excited to surprise my husband with it . however , when i received it , there wa a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language . i wa shocked ! nowhere on amazon description of this product doe it indicate this . i am shipping it back right away .
0	yuck
1	beautifully written and sung . a song to listen to over and over . sound quality is good especially with headphone , oh yeahhhh .
1	fun song , love it
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening 1. i used this product for about two year , at least 5 day a week , and completed the full 1 hour session each time . i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever . i gave it my best shot , i thought if i kept at it , one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me . but no , nothing , nothing good happened , no overwhelm even , just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean .
0	i absolutely love this song ! however , the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible . it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it . it did only cost $ .25 so i guess i will live with it .
0	i paid for this song so i could attach it to some picture of my daughter . it would not play the whole thing . i definitely felt ripped off
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer . the beat are pretty nice . if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat , that have a very raw/rough feel and sound . the right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal , etc on top . if , however , someone is looking for larger selection of beat , some with music , they could check out heat beat vol 1 by royalty free , then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league , or something like that . hope this help
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
1	always have been a journey fan
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back . his version is amazing . if you buy his version through february , proceeds go to charity ! if you buy this version , you will be supporting glee , who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit . no , thank you !
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy . i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one . sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample . well this wa the only full version of her retail album , so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it . i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored ! this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store . they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is a censored version when they do not offer the real version at all . now i am stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar . i feel intentionally misled .
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to . 1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to .
1	with their sophmore album , lifehouse ha defenitely improved . their sound ha matured and become so much better ( not that no name face wa bad ) . the album first single , spin , is very energetic and uplifting ( and the video made me dizzy ) . a few other track to note are anchor , which is a powerful song , am i ever gon na find out , which is incredibly catchy , take me away , another very powerful one , and the beginning , which is beautiful enough to make me cry . lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall . i strongly recommend it .
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan , but i love this new song . it modern , clean , and just a great song . if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album , i think it going to be great .
1	jojos voice is truly gifted ! she ha comeback with great force and can not wait for further music from her in the future ! this tringle is great !
1	like it
1	beautiful song !
1	love elvis music
0	low sound quality . i deleted .
1	beautiful song
0	purchased this and it never did show up in my account .
1	love them
1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again . she is back and this album outshines believe . cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful voice to send these song through the roof . song for the lonely will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today . alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible . when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track . people - buy this album . let u put cher at number 1 again where she belongs !
0	i agree with eric , who reviewed this cd , like him i find this cd not too attractive . other than the hit song heard it all before , sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album . the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor , which could be labeled a light cuisine . a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good . i would not dare to compare her to kelly price , she might have a potential , but she is still got a long way to go to get there .
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube . beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound . plus i love the disco beat . little known now and little info about them anymore . they were popular in europe in the early 80 . i think they were english but played a lot in germany . do not think they did much in the u .
1	my kid love this song ! it is so much fun to listen to and sing along with . bonus , i do not get tired of hearing it .
0	i came to this wanting to like it . i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever . i have all of rogers solo work , seen him a few time back in the 80 on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour . i am a fan . my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak . if life is really that bad , get a puppy ! i mean , i find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this - i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash . i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here ? i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig ( three different one ) and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death , another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak , i got rid of it . then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it . i never listen to it . this is music to depress yourself to . who need that ? if i want to be depressed i will watch the news . i do not need to hear it in my music . life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race . i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song .
1	great
1	some of my favorite music from back in the 80 . brings back so many wonderful memory ! the cd arrived in perfect condition !
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1 ? mr. big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit . he is so emotional . it must be from the bottom of his heart
0	just not the same a bon jovi
1	you have to consider , though , that music of this kind sort of play itself , and a far a i am concerned , the organist must just not get in the way of it . walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue , which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard , and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned . towards the end , i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed , still keeping within a modest forte . because there are no extreme of dynamic , i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car , where extreme softs and louds are problematic . ( modern equipment can do compression , which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car , so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration . ) bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy , but it hold up beautifully . i recommend it , and the entire set .
0	ok
1	wonderful music , a always by josh groban .
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort . i find it boring . i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only 2 or 3 likable song out of 14. that is not what i wanted . i wanted 6-8 track that were very good not just 2-3. of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer . but this difference is sound went the wrong way . everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it . i have listend to this album 6 or 7 time and still am not too thrilled . brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened . i hope the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed .
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
1	this is great and interesting music . this is music that is both creative a well a being entertaining . i look forward to listening to future music contribution .
0	not what i expected
1	love this vinyl
0	audio is terrible
0	definitely need to be remastered .
1	love this song !
0	ok cd . a few good song but not worth the buy . obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend , this will work
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be . a lot of the song i have never heard before .
1	always smooth .
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument . undoubtedly , sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra , the london classical player , are a highlight of this recording . the music is played with precision , a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically . what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the 5th symphony , which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording . norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work - his interpretation of beethoven 2nd and 8th symphony are , in some way , his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle . i listened to the 5th yesterday , when i wa feeling very low , and it put me in a much better frame of mind . we all need music like this sometimes . i have needed it a lot lately . sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having . i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it . modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous , heavy and stodgy . a recording for people who like fresh , crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar , washed down with chilled chardonnay , and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat , stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table !
0	only got this for a friend .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer .
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day . but let u face it , back in the day he wa in his twenty . keith is almost 50 year old now and still singing that teenage music . it is time for him to sing some grown up song . his title and lyric are so immature for his age . his voice still sound nice , but he need to grow the heck up ! to his credit , he look fine a hell on his new cd cover , very mature looking for someone so immature !
0	really misleading . it is more of a 10 minute show than a full length one . lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it .
1	another big streisand winner album . great collaboration duo .
0	this 1981 recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me , one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest , silliest , and corniest the label ha to offer in new york ( with the exception of the three song i already mentioned . ) this recording wa of course , an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune . the problem here , aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived , is that the three african song ( 1 , 2 , & 4 singed in african dialect and in french ) are totally uneventful , bland , uninspiring , linear , unvaried , monotonous and totally pointless ! . there is nothing happening ! . laba sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising , and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid-back tropical beach feel with a little electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerve ! . the 1st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo ! . it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to , and encourages them to dance it even further ! . song . 2 feature a chorus a long , a annoying and a insipid a : in coc , in coc , in coc de ba saaah , de ba saaah , de ba saaah all the way through till the end ! . other than that , we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique , curacao , ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut ( whatever that mean ! ) and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach ! he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too ! . ( while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth , this is really a bad a it get . ) for song . 4 , i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality , but which still come out pretty well coming from him . the reason why i decided to review this recording ( now that it ha been available under mp3 downloads since the 5th of august 2008 ) is to tell you to download the great 3. maracaibo oriental , the nice 6. pelta ( written by miguel matamros ) and maybe song . 5 anichayi which aint gon na change your world , but which is decent enough not to be skipped ( or bought for just $ 0.89 on mp3 downloads . ) even though this label wa mainly run by african associate ( a pianist alfredo valds jr. explained on his fascinating interview : the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section [ . ] ) i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly , or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality ! i would say each to their own thing ! . therefore , the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competences/knowledge to do it ! i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be ! finally , there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in 1982 , and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one ! there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental , overall the album doe show better with a big hit : diamoul maw , 2 rock-solid cuban tune which also happen to be song . 3 and 6 , and apparently another hit being song . 5 aminata . i would not dare risking recommend it to you all , but check it out anyway & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/laba-sosseh/dp/b001esgx6w/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > laba sosseh < /a > . song . 3 maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno-descrga tune ! it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr. that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end ! . there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate , outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago , amazing 2-trumpets/1-trombone horn arrangement , a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement ! . everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here ! . [ * descrga in latin music term mean jam-session . ] song . 6 pelta ( most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros ) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk . otherwise , the tune is very pleasant , fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement , a tres-guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end . the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta ! [ meaning jerk in spanish slang ] . basically , a simple and great tune ! . for song . 5 ( which is a decent enough son-montno tune ) , i will let you lot take the punt . sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine , but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago , and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those 2 song ! . my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long , lacked melody and were unexciting too .
0	i have trouble keeping this cd on . the singing is dreadful . her voice is horrible . it sound like she is calling the devil . my kid leave when it is on . i can not recommend this cd , it is just not good .
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra , with mary martin doing the singing . that is the plus , a it is always a pleasure to hear her . why should not i is the third standard ( or maybe it is an almost standard ) from cole porter jubilee , and definitely a favorite song of mine . this is a very good straight version , without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it . the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse , which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric ( e.g . i must find some kind persona grata , to give me data , personally ) . for that reason , i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song .
0	too much talking
1	classic al stuff . in his usual humorous style . early in al album every song is great .
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in . not good to work out to .
1	i lost this song from my mp3 album . i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me . this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago .
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. you are husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
1	grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled time it is no suprise . but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love . the theme song deputy this in a haunting way .
1	i wa happy to see that this track wa offered for sale , a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd . i feel that , with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording , this is the best recording of the show out there .
0	great song , but the download version is only 128kbps . why is no higher quality version available ?
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music . i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment . i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition . hey ry , stick to music for everyone .
1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
1	he is a young george straight . nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music . i hope he ha a great career .
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station . i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood ( iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station ) . anyhow from my perspective , see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im ready to aim . the music complement the song a well .
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan . i own all of their previous album . therefore , i wa all excited for this album to come out , even though , i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait . i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better . they are not ! i would/will not waste any money on this album . it is a very big disappointment , especially judging it based on their previous work . they can and should be putting out better work than this .
1	the star say it all , do not know what else i could put other than i love it .
0	meh , not my type i guess .
1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever . the movie is great , and so is the soundtrack . kevin spacey doe a great job all around !
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship . it is not cry , but mere acceptance of the inevitable . toni braxton sound beautiful in it .
0	very disappointed in this cd . it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song , too annoying to listen too .
1	one of conways sexy song .
1	this is great sound and pink is good in everything that she sings . if you love this like i do get all of her music .
1	jackies voice ha really matured . a other reviewer have said and i agree with , this is hauntingly beautiful . this being the first single from her new album , i really can not wait to hear the other song from the album .
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this . would never listen to it ( and i tried ) .
1	awesome song and it is a timeless classic . i dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
0	very highly sought after album . and - it is very well done . to bad it is a pirated cd . this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it , you are supporting pirated music . but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it is site . and this one , it appears , is here to stay . after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale of these type of item .
0	his vocal are too modern country . the song are depressing and mundane . they are all too similar . it just go on for too long .
1	nice
0	of all the song to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track , this one about the worst you could pick . i previewed some of her other track . not great . but definitely not a bad a this track . i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one . not good .
0	disappointed . nothing like their first track .
0	ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information . wa not like the picture . returned 1st one and ordered a second which wa identical to the first . also wa returned .
1	always a classic song . great quality , too .
1	great album - can not wait to hear more from this group !
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode . then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song . i wa sold . that wa when i decided to purchase this song . she reminds me of a japanese shakira . the donde estan los ladrones shakira : soulful , gritty , heart-thread tugging , soul speaking singer .
0	think i deserve my money back . this song wa labeled a clean , yet upon playing the entire song , there are several profane word . wasted my money because i can not listen to it .
1	great song !
0	it sounded good on the clip . after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be .
1	it is pure pink .
0	not good
0	package wa sent back originally because it wa too damaged . i had to re-order the product and when i received it the case wa severely damaged any ] way .
0	this is not the full song , it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration . i actually want my money back . do not buy !
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol , boring !
0	problem is not the music . but they apparently sent u a blank . four different cd player and not a one can read it . holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track .
0	terrible use of auto-tune .
0	product sucked got it and it skip very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad .
1	love it .
0	mostly instrumental .
0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd . what a waste of money . could these song be sung any slower ? very disapointed . l
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you , but it is just an instrumental version of the song . it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything . i wish i had known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want .
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far ! can not wait to hear the rest of their album . the boy are awesome and so talented !
0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to alexa
1	awesome song !
0	pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd . forgettable .
1	love this song . nate is a great praise and worship singer .
0	just get yourselves an exocist !
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
0	it is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it . it wa just some breathing noise and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy . i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling . would not reccomend
0	i am from mxico . i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality , too much surface noise and not very good sound . i decided not to get the next one . but when my favorite maiden album ( this one and 7th son ) came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity . i have to say it wa the same disappointment . they do not even sound nearly a my 80 uk edition . whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection . i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl . too much surface noise and tick and pop . please , if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl .
1	i love bronn journey harp music . thanks .
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube . loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep . had one of the best sleep in a long time . maybe it wa a one off , but this wa encouraging . time will tell .
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want . amazon . a little warning next time please . i still cant find the song i did order . anybody can help with this ? im going in circle here . secondly , the song wa annoying at first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy . cross between old beatles music and alternative rock . least it not filled with suicide , violence and cursing . i will be looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo , not a bad idea . agaion , amazon , a little warning next time before you just dump something on them . you need to make your uploading process easier . this is getting to be too much work for too little . i may stick to itunes
1	fantastic
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber . this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way , and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother . very inspirational !
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd . a a collector of original cast album of flop musical , i regretfully bought that cd . it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album . the insert came straight off of a computer printer , the first band wa silent ( the actual recording started on the second band ) leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement . hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range .
1	love it .
0	i downloaded this song because it wa free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
1	keeping it real .
1	great song better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season 1
0	would not download . error in file name .
1	best cd i bought in a year . i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing .
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file . i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file/windows medium of my pc . now i can not load the song onto my android phone . i tried over and over again . the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer . will someone call or email me and straighten this out .
1	great
1	great
0	disappointed . poor subject matter , poor quality .
0	not too sure about this one !
1	heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song . brought back memory when i wa younger .
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly . after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post-2004 , they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence . unfortunately , this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea , resulting in track that i would never expect from this band . destroyer already start this off on an iffy note , with it rhythm section going for the big , loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena . bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing-along chorus . vice grip , the first single , also follows in this vein . then we have track like crushed , which first bite off heaven shall burn , then sound like they are attempting to be some 3rd rate rage against the machine knockoff . writing on the wall is a complete joke , with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you , complete with dubbed in violin . whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity , i actually like the track dedicated , a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound , and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well . it is not a complete loss of an album , but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound . i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist .
1	an outstanding collection of song by a group out of vega , they are featured on the soundtrack for resident evil extinction track 15 contagious i have not heard a new band this good in year . hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music , but these guy . these guy changed all that . thank you adam , ricky , kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius , i look forward to more of your stuff ! check them out on their myspace page [ . ] . add them and tell them alex from nc sent you !
0	what a rip off of katy perry . wow ! how no one ha noticed is unbelievable !
1	love it , fun dance song
1	thank you
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass . this portion is so moving , i can listen to it over and over .
0	did not like this version of his . i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back-up singer . oh well .
1	love this song
0	not only is she a horrible singer . she support cop killer . she is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video . please do not support her !
0	nancy sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault ! she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon .
0	i downloaded it .
1	a mellow , infectious , romantic love song , not only for the female specie , but most definitely for guy who are truly in love .
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new york : big sophisticated city image .
1	very good centering music to maintain balance .
0	7 second of what , the hunger game intro ? do not get this download . you will regret it . need i say more .
0	this is not the original version .
1	great music . very inspirational .
0	actually , it did not . the first tune wa nice , but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all . if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake , and i just found it too irritating .
0	no rocky top ? ! ? why bother ? that is like warm beer & cold pizza , close but not quite .
0	the song is fine , but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro , like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny .
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flutist that i wa looking for . i wa very disappointed that it wa not !
1	this is an absolute classic . it brings me back to the day when michael wa but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app
1	good song
1	love it . ha a bluesy sound .
1	best duo
1	it is great ! i love it
0	very old school , but wa looking for the song for a frend
0	i never ordered this . i hope it wa free .
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak , however , not stating this is 45 second long is almost misrepresenting itself . in fact , it is . listen to the free clip - you have heard 70 % of the interview . shame on you , amazon !
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. really take me back to that time , really good song .
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive , it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office . one minute you are straining to hear the word , the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down . susan boyle voice is low , almost a mumble , and she sound like a little girl- not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection . i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it .
0	sick . trash deleting asap
0	the worst try-hard band i have ever heard - how did these turd get an album out ? oh yeah - rich parent . ugh , lovely . it suck , do not waste your money .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	for country music fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the music of schuyler , knobloch and overstreet , judy rodman , and schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt , this cd is a must for your collection . this cd cover most of the major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd . judy rodman , who wa a minor success ( and mtm record only artist before folding ) in the early to mid 80 ha several of her best known hit on this release . from the up tempo girl ride horse too to the memory laced until i met you , these two song are just a few of the hard to find gem on any cd of any type . i wa absolutely estatic to find the schuyler , knobloch and overstreet song you can not stop love in this collection . this is a song that i have searched for on cd for 3 year . this cd also ha rarity from the girl next door ( slow boat to china ) , schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt ( baby got a new baby ) , and two becky hobbs selection ( jones on the jukebox , they always look better when they are leavin ) . if you are searching for these obscure recording on cd , this offering will not disappoint you .
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel , the da song soon ! and narration by chuck smith . really , if you have shotgun angel , there is little reason to buy this . if you do not have shotgun angel , get it instead . if you are buying this for the song soon ! ( which is the weakest song on it ) get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead . if you are buying this for the narration , it is not worth it . i can not criticize the biblical passage , though not particularly well read ; but the interpretive part is not well done . i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement , but i knew this would be the case before buying the album ; i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile - and it would have , had i not already had all the song . the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision . i really felt like only giving this one star , but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for , were they not better found in their original context ( shotgun angel ) .
1	love this song , reminiscent of grover washington jr. great style and warmth .
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast , bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word . can not wait for the album .
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa ! maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again . i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year ! i feel ripped off and so disappointed !
0	crazy music
0	i do not think anyone over the age of 16 like ( or can relate to ) nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed ( playing gig in a band doe not count ) . once you become become of that age , the most important thing are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school . clearly , the people here are the pre-teen target audience . look at the misspelling , look at the abbreviation of even simple word , and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves . they would do anything for kurdt and are easily-lead . just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it . if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day , would you enjoy that ? same concept with these song . people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment . just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it .
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ! ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song ! keep up the good work
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf

1	this is by far his most unappreciated work , yet one of his best . a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook . it is unique , it is honest and it is meaningful . the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate , a bottle of wine and quiet evening . i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this .
0	not impressed
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap . i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted . it wa adverized a being sold on amazon . i decided to buy it . so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon . but it wa not the same version ! only one verse wa in english . i felt extremely disappointed ! i wanted the english version so very much . but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what i wa led to believe i wa buying : the english version of veni sante spiritus ! do not be fooled !
1	prince wa ahead of his time on this one . my grandchild like it and the older one understand it too .
1	. but not the people that sold it to me . it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front . very disappointed . : (
1	love it , great song .
0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past . the word of god renews my spirit daily !
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor : when i first heard her 4 or 5 year ago , i thought , wow ! she is really unique and awesome ! . then came her next record and i thought . hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it . she ha managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight record . i think that is a record or something ( pun intended ) . i just want to tell her , yea , we have got it , you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million time for effect .
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead . even worse , they might mistake it for the original . collection like this need more one-star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them .
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through .
0	art garfunkel ? his version wa much better , more relaxed , and much smoother . i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr. grobans range .
1	this is terry fator . what more can you ask for ? a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan .
1	the story wa good . the music wa so so . we hail from new jersey . and grew up listening to the four season . we used to follow them intensely . wherever they were appearing . we know their sound . the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong . he wa singing to falsetto . you know over doing . this is our opinion , but then again we are jersey girl !
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song . it really resonates with the pain i am current healing from . thank you , plumb .
0	if it where possible , i would leave zero star ! one of the worst album i have ever purchased .
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world , i do not think that this wa the way to do it , she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter , and should have found a better way to express herself . these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible . i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly , feel a bit embarassed for her too : - (
1	have 3 of their cd and love all three . love how they bring some old song back to new life god is great !
0	not to much into the hard rock sound .
0	when i bought this dvd i wa expecting to get the famous cali lifestyle 2 dvd . instead i got the audio cd with a small sample of creeper present cali lifestyle 2. the small sample dvd only contains about 4 minute of video footage from creeper cali lifestyle 2 dvd . if you want the full dvd contact cali finest production . you can also buy the full dvd just a long it doe not contain the audio cd . i wa very dissapointed with this purchase .
1	this is a very good sounding mp3 download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
0	these guy are terrible .
0	quality of recording is not perfect ? * %
0	i liked both of the single , undead and no . 5 , that came out a while back . i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping . based on the single , which were decent rap metal , i wa expecting a rap metal cd . but this cd actually ha 12 white boy gangsta rap track and 2 rap metal track . huge disappointment and totally not what i wa expecting . the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la , talk about cliche . i think it is fitting that the re-release of this cd is called desperate measure ( to make money . ) i have already given the cd away . i guess if you are a fan of eminem copycat or icp , this is the cd for you , but i do not need to listen to poseur white kid rap about bitch , drug , and double-ds .
0	i accidentally bought it . i hate it . i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it . it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor .
1	cool !
0	the whole mp3 is just noise , not good noise , not even a lot of noise but noise . what a bunch of hooey . do not click on this one . the only reason i wa looking wa i tried steve g. jones and in two night have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choice when eating . it is also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep . but this one - boo hiss stay away . glad i only wasted $ .99 . whew .
1	forget ravel bolero . this is the most sensuous , evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone . it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace . share it with someone you love .
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer , but to me , songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here , along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level . i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit - that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength . this album is more like day in the life ditty . to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper . a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this ( all original ) and which caught me fully first time through . you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle . crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection .
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the 90 and 2000s . these song are a great mix of catchy tune , fun lyric , and biblical truth . furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together . the highlight of the album for me is it is alright ( for lazarus ) . i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry . it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death . a few other highlight for me include shame , right wrong girl , and dare i say . truthfully , i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music . it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio .
0	i am so disappointed in the last 3 i bought b/c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song , rearranged or in a different language . this is very poor representation especially for a new group . whoever made those decision should be fired . their objective should b to make new follower , not loose them . i have purchased 15 dvd a present and 2 new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label .
0	love the song . hate the download process through amazon . i do not want your player amazon . you made the normal download link to small , like fine print . took me too long to figure out . made me grouchy .
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style . i wa very disappointed . his sound doe not work with these song . it is not enjoyable . the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic , which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound , but the choice of song wa wrong . sorry bob !
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video . i did not like the rap in the middle , did not seem to fit the song .
1	stylistically , i love all type of music . but , how do i classify fireflights album , for those who wait album - is it indie , is it rock - i do not know ? but , what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work ! drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band - with fireflight , there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person - and , the driving vocal of pat benatar , and pop musicality of the go-gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs . ( thanks , pooh for the great word , smackerl , you silly ole bear ) . yet , although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular-bands-of-yore-oh-so-great in fireflights unique sound - i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh - and dare i say anointed ? check out the band website - [ . ] . they have their video available for your viewing pleasure . there is a genuine story being told in each song - i assure you .
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic . unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up . i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl , but the seller did list this a good condition yet 90 % of it wa unplayable . very disappointed .
0	not my kind of music , downloaded them for a funeral
0	after a couple of day , song refused to play . had to download from another server .
0	ordered and paid for 3 song . only one song down loaded . amazon site said all 3 were down loaded . my e-mail to them for help wa never answered . customer service suck !
0	rip teleka . this man took your life . i am sorry that people think he some kind of god . but your god will bring you justice someday !
1	phenomenal !
1	great song ! band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well ! recommend to people who like heavy metal , just not cookie monster metal !
0	sanjaya wa entertaining on idol . but he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy . this song is terrible ! off-key warbling , non-melodic , soulless . pas this up asap !
0	love the band , but there only one good song on this release . seriously , anything that say feat . in it is passe and unoriginal . if you are so good , why do you need help ? it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together , and now everyone is doing it . seriously , keep the dj out . none of the good one know wtf they are doing . i will pas on this one . collide is much better , and 13 song at that .
1	great song , long length . thought provoking . brings back good memory from the 90 . you will ask yourself . where wa i when i heard that ?
1	my 14 month old baby love this song . quality is great . i wanted exactly same sinsong , singed by same singer etc . and i think this is it !
0	not many good song . a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite . his first three album are off the chart . but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop . what a bad album . ive waited this long for this . i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound . he need a producer , some one to make dope beat . this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it . im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more . at least the wu keep it real . built for cuban link 2 wa great . reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music ?
0	when wilson first broke into country music , her hit such a redneck woman , homewrecker and here for the party were cutting , fresh and brash . now her latest single , do not do me no good is just uninspired- it sound like the 101th song out there on country radio . an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is . wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself . she should just take her advice when she sings on this track , yeah i know it aint right/to sit around all night and let your memory/get the best of me .
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the 70 , but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame . amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music . who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd ?
1	dr. octagon paramedic fetus of the east with priest , i am from the church of the operating room . with the strike support scalpel since the holocaust , i do indeed in greed explore meet the patient . back to broom with the nurse with the voodoo curse . holding up office light standing at huge height . back and forth , left wing , swing to north , east and south with blood pouring down your mouth . i come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope , listen to your heartbeat , delete beep beep beep ! your insurance is high , but my price is cheap . look at the land . blue flower ! drawing by the purple pond , in the purple pasture blue flower ! drawing by the purple pond , yellow ink that flow blue flower ! drawing by the pond , look , it is raining yellow . would you care to listen to me more ? thank you ! holding bag on down right from the hospital , it is a patient that is worth to keep the germ off the turf . cybernetic microscope and metal antidote , two telescope that magnify the size of a roach . three computer to a cup of coffee planted with my hand and astro-planets detached turn on rear foggers cut the light on the kid , and turn the bright on . supersonic wave combine and burn a brain wave . i see the mascot of evil he is not kneivel . shakespeare gone do not even think about it ! yes , a i am going to the park , i see . blue flower ! it is raining green , by the pond blue flower ! it is totally raining green , pouring blue flower ! i smell the bee and the bird blue flower ! different aspect of life , blue flower .
1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of u .
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie , but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother . this audio encounter is not by the mayles , and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party . the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck . the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive . i do not know the timing of this production but big edie ( mum ) doe not seem to take part at all . the appeal of little edie had always been her expression , body language , and refreshing vocal ; this production did not stimulate at all , and wa frankly a little humdrum .
1	this is a good track from my teen year . it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood . i have not heard any of their other music , but this is a good track to get ; )
0	back in the very early 90 , i had this ( the cassette tape version ) and thought it wa amazing . until i bought the cd recently , i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me . it wa almost painful to listen to , and i remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music ! i would only recommend this for laugh or a 90 nostalgia night .
1	i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better . the lyric , vocal , instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen .
1	her usual perfect music . love it .
1	stevie is hot , young or older
0	i have been a big boc fan since the 1970s , and have gotten most of their album along the way , but imaginos wa one that got away from me . i have seen many online comment about how great it is , and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction . so , when this reissue wa released , i had to pick it up . well . it really doe not do it for me , i am afraid . the problem is that , first of all , it doe not sound like a boc album , and , a i recently discovered , it is not . it is a solo album by bocs drummer , albert bouchard , and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera . despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger , the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another . the rather pointless re-do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with . and if you are going to call this a boc album , you have got ta have buck dharma , who get short shrift here . the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album , apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own . the album is not a total disaster ( i kind of like the baron frankenstein number ) , but i am very glad that i did not pay $ 100.00 for it on ebay ! i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja , and hope to see that happen sometime soon . ( p 07/27/08 : club ninja is coming soon ! )
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i.e . passenger . it is not and wasnt worth keeping . i tossed it in the trash . what a waste of $
0	this is terrible . anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever . it so overplayed & way overrated .
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it .
0	wow . a christmas album featuring a rhodes ! ? i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room , so i wa elated to see this cd . but it is not played on a rhodes . it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard , complete with cheezy drum track . it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano . what a disappointment . all the song are very stiff , a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live . i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title .
0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case ! i am livid !
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret , or even fire garden . but gospel and blue type singing ? . kind of a turn off . i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album . and that hurt to say .
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music . that is what i consider this . along with the postal service , music to fall asleep to .
1	terrific !
1	this song is awesome . i am not a huge fan of three day grace , but this is by far my favorite .
0	music wa too high i could not use the soundtrack . i tried with my soprano and they could not sing to the soundtrack .
0	censored version , but it had the explicit label
0	i love ne-yo but this album wasnt what i expected
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness ! do i really need to say anything ? if your a jimi fan , buy it and listen !
1	rip
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album , which i think is great ! this one did not deliver like that one for me but i am still listening to it . i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening . usually for me when an album doe not hit me right away , it will a little later , well see .
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me . how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric ? better songwriting is definitely in order .
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd ? i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright , but , being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album , i wa certainly looking forward to more than this . a were my pink floyd - loving friend who listened to it . sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album , but would work a add-on lead done live . i hate to think poorly of these guy , but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off-hand way . nothing at all to sink your teeth into . wa this a contractual obligation album ? resting on their laurel ? it will sell because of who we are ! guy , please do not end your musical career a a band with this one !
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
1	love this song . start my day out with it .
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy .
1	i love her music , it is great to listen to . she is one of the great singer in the world right now . i love playing her song .
1	my wedding song thirty-two year ago
1	thank you so much , it is fantastic , i truly appreciate it , very very peaceful ! it is amazing the way it make you feel !
0	like the other review of this gift , the question is why . why wa this even recorded and released , that is just for starter .
1	incredible musical talent and so inspirational ! love love love it !
1	great song . love it .
1	exactly what i wa hoping for ! heard the title song , you+me , and love that sound . lucky for me all the song sound just a good . listen to it everyday .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week . deftones is one of my favorite band .
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not . either way , like it or not , once you hear it , it is stuck in your head . i am one of those who like it , hence , that is why i downloaded it . it may not be the greatest song ever done , but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick .
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone . i just love to listen to him sing
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned 6. she love it . we listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip . it brought me to tear to hear the old song that shaped my spirituality when i wa young , and i am so thrilled i can share it with my daughter .
1	well it is wreckx-n-effect . what more need to be said . mr teddy riley did it yet again . with this group made up of his brother & cousin he killed the 90
0	too sad . must be a liberal
1	i will always love 3 door down !
1	i love his music and message
0	basically my sister ( 16 year old ) is listening to this garbage in the other room , and it is aggravating ; i do not like shopping at the mall , and this music is teleporting me there . it is the definition of insipid , and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy , and thus spending dough . in other word , this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience . it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though . to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small , and the world at large . anyone who like this doe not like music , but i would not know , i do not like music either-i like mogwai-good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock . for if it dunnae rock ti piss
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of 52 year . what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer .
0	did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a 50th class reunion power point presentation .
1	get me pumped for the gym
0	dumb
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here . been a slipknot fan since the beginning . all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree . but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion . it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal . most cd grow on ya a time go . but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clip in a song or two . that is because these song are all over the place . they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start . the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them . i do not agree with those saying this is iowa 2.0. this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer . skip this chapter .
1	what a great song !
0	ok not what i expected
0	love the song but this version is barely audible . hello , it is rock , where is the volume .
0	it ok but not iggys best
1	classic redman . glad to see him back
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd . i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand . with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere . i really do not know how to describe how i feel . it is not bad music , it is not a bad album . but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band - i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it . i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford & son - other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have . i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke , this is not going to be one of them . it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because - dare i say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing . i am not going to purchase new - i will wait for used and cheaper . not that i think amazon is asking too much - i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar . sorry mumford & son , the album is ok but not what we really liked you for .
0	. the mp3 is of bad quality . be wary of downloading amazon southern gospel mp3s . i have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad lp or something . edit : my mp3 skipping problem wa traced back to my dial-up connection . be sure to download amazon mp3s via broadband for best music quality .
1	i love me some brad paisley .

1	even switchfoots b-sides are amazing ! any fan would love this ep
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap-rock band , in detail . i am not one of those people . for me , this genre is a side dish , not the main course , but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it . new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album , numb : the same anger , the same desperation , the same hard edge . but i think that frontmen tac and hash , while working from this genre , wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance . tac ha stated : . it is a snapshot of our generation right now . the way a lot of u feel in a time of war , technology , pain and love . it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today . i have felt this way , but i have not articulated it , even to myself . abicas lyric reflect this state of affair , and musically they draw on various influence . the main one i notice are linkin park , hollywood undead and of course , eminem . the lyric cover the whole range of problem - political , personal and social . the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album : if everything that mattered to me is now gone . now take a closer look and tell me what you see . track 2 , tell u why , continues with the directly political : we are underground . before you say goodbye , you have got to tell u why . thing get more personal in turn me on , which seems to be about people questioning one route to self-satisfaction . in my song and the thing you think i say , the anguish is over failed relationship . the pursuit ha the line just let me in . if i get the chance to play , i think you will want me to stay . beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time : you are beautiful , so { censored } beautiful . i would be a little more complete if i just had you . just another , never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense , demanding and hypocritical . a for musical influence , there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable . three of the track open with melodic , solemn piano , which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious . i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of , say , nine-inch nail . gave em a reason open with dance music element , then includes some excellent guitar work , both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic , spiritual , up , and grunge is depressing , scary , down . several track have a synth-string background that give them a more mainstream sound . just another includes military-style drumming and army-march lingo . release from numbness come in the final track what you see , with an ironic twist . they sing , open up your eye . nothing more to hide . now the time ha come/and all this go away , and i am not { censored } numb . look around , nothing ever heals the pain . the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them . it could almost be an 80 pop-rock track , and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting . hmmmm . the album is full of explicit language ( which i had to censor in this review ) , so if you are one of those people who can not take that , by all mean stay away . but if you are ok with free expression , you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while .
0	i think it is so good message is great i just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star .
1	lady gaga - cheer to you darling , this song is fabulous ! i highly recommend you buy it . i did and i will never regret it . this is a song you can listen to over and over again . wonderful ! : )
0	pearl jam is the band that basically told mtv to f- off after their first album - nirvana is the band that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout , pearl jam got huge because of their music & they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated , phony fake band ever - pearl jam is truly the greatest band ever , pearl jam stuck by their word , cobain never did fact : cobain used to call mtv & tell mtv to play nirvana music video more

0	i am not a music critic , i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for . i can simply say i did not enjoy the album . one , maybe 2 good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list . i hope they , zac brown band , plan to get back to country again soon . still listening to all of their other album daily .
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album . monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement .
0	great music . the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk . it wa very difficult to play my copy . like most people , i have more then one device to play a cd in . this cd doe not work in most of them .

1	love this song !
0	one song for $ 9.99 ? i guess it is my fault that i did not read the product description , but i wa under the impression , for that price , that i wa getting a full length cd .
1	i just like it .
0	i very rarely bother to write a review , unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something . unfortunately this is the latter . i have always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak , materialistic , egotistical , club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 year now . though every album ha had a different feel to it , i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.this album is slowwwwwed down . tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music . not everything ha to be 300 mile per hour of awesomeness , but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either . the dj wa completely uninspired . i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist . usually a complex mixture of big brass , synthesizer , different time signature , other genre of music thrown in , and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around , this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music . the lyric are amazing a usual , you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album ( the only reason i am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 ) dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd.most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good , then slows down horrifically for the last two parts.there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album.the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n9ne cd . sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system . not the reason i buy tech n9ne . if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays . like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time . he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo . i am sure it will sell well . i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n9ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again .
0	got a free download for purchasing cd from amazon . tried to download , but wa not successful . tech support from amazon non-existent . i am sure it wa opperator error , but they only give you one chance . i have let other free download offer expire . not worth the hassle . love billy joel , have album , cassette , and cd .
1	good song .
1	like steampunk ? well , this is electro-swing - and about half of the electro-swing album i find , i would call steampunk themed music . caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro-swing album that i have found . i highly recomend it . be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that is what i like about it ( it make it a bit more timeless ) . it is fantastic for driving , or background music at party . enjoy !
1	wonderful old song - not covered enough at all .
1	awesome value ! this is a great mix of classic christmas tune , instrumental and vocal , and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party . for $ .99 there is no better value .
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for . not much to say about a music mp3
0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 piece . mine only downloaded 100 .
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and did not want to buy an album with a bunch of music i did not want .
1	a nice smooth song with a meaning .
1	heard this song on the radio a few time and loved it . when i finally found out the name , i bought . it is cute and catchy , preview it and see ( hear ) for yourself = )
1	listening to him is so relaxing
1	i love this song ! nick voice is so hot ! it is always my ringtone around valentine day ! i do wish him and jess were still together but i still love it !
0	awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [ lp ] is pretty bad ! my copy ha pitting on a couple song so the needle jump . the fun side of buying vinyl i guess . then when i go online to download with the given code i am told that it not valid a the code ha already been redeemed . total fail !
1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song . i just had to get it for her .
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album . i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them . so i will not spend the money to buy the entire album . when this song is available to download individually , let me know and you just might get a sale .
1	a good , clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series . to hear it would always take me back to the early 70 . now , it reminds me of that tv series .
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful , full baritone , and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful , timeless song , but i found myself surprisingly disappointed . he is done something to change his technique , and he often sound nasally , especially when he sings word with the e vowel . i think he is been ill-advised in this latest singing technique , and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method !
1	nice
1	love the song it is so uplifting and i play it three or four time a day just to get moving !
1	i saw ruben win on american idol , love his singing .
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music . most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it . i do .
1	fabulous music , love the violin and the piano in the background . the music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me . one of the best cd ever !
0	did not download a expected , emailed amazon , no answer !
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
1	my student ad i love this song and the video that made u go and buy it . it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone !
1	this wa a well received gift . can not go wrong with john lennon anything .
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen to . i recomend it highly although i do not recomend the second set 100 more piano masterpiece .
1	great album wet dream , and hello are definitely stand out song for me . hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja-rule day back where mc were willing to sing their own hook and i think j. cole doe it well on the track he doe it .
1	road trip music
1	wonderful song ! great lyric and a really catchy tune . you will be singing this one even when it is not playing : ) let love explode and bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is surely alive he is living on the inside roaring like a lion !
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument . everybody think it wa korn , but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage . you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn , nickelback , and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the 1990s . almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana- monotone vocal that explode into raging scream , wall of distorted guitar noise , and whiney lyric about how miserable life is . do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll ? nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing . nirvana were not about music . they were about conformity and nothing more . just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable , immature , whiney suburban teenager from their money . they were the backstreet boy with guitar , basically . the linkin park of 88-94. i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last decade .
0	i reely thank this is just badily , i will not lake it becaz it is joust a bunch of dude singan about in clubbing and other stuff that blackies . i do not lake to here aboot this crape , he iz onely a musicer becaz he got shoot 9 tames . this cd doe not like to . i do not . i thank this cd is not soundful bat mast cd now day a. arent . not . i doo nat lake this at , all . thes guy is not gad he canot sang . he cannto . maybe i joust do not like dark tone skin . or naybe mot . who care . do not buy , i recceomend you to buy this , not . not to reccomend it is to buy me . please do nat buy or reckomend it . dont . do not . no love ! dont !
0	you can tell this is not an original , buy the dubbing and sound quality . i have and original jim stafford album from the 70 and this is not the same ouality of sound . suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england ,
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song , it is a little different but it is okay
1	awesome !
1	this is a great song with a great message . yolanda adam is one of the best gospel/inspirational singer ever . king kong aint got nothing one her ! ( lol )
0	i would love to give this a great review ( because i have been purchasing mp3 downloads for year from amazon ) . but after all my searching , my hard drive show no sign of this song . wish i could say more . i have tried all of the trouble shooting suggestion made by the account manager . still no luck . so . until i get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads i have ever purchase . i will have to hold off on any positive review .
0	i love the original video recording , but this version add way to much instrument background music . make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song .
1	you can b. sure that this tune is still great ! get it now ! it will bring back old memory , and sound all new at the same time .
0	i wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not .
0	despite this being a label album , it really just another flame album . v rose only get one track to herself , and it the forgettable threw it all away . ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference , the label ha stuck with their two artist . yes , a lot of various artist from reach record , cross movement , and beyond are brought in to add flavor , but it flame project without question . and it ok , but it not a good a flame usual stuff , which ha been declining a of late in my opinion . i am kinda disappointed , a the guest did not shine particularly bright either , so i will give it a 2 , maybe a 2.5 no knock on the message , thats great . but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall .
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	i love the song white christmas . michael and shania make a very good duet couple . very good christmas song for anyone .
0	i will not marry you , woman ! it is rude to keep asking .
0	i like the cd or better said , prince music . my problem is the packaging is crap . i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out . the cd snapped like a potato chip . seriously . product quality mean everything , not just the music .
1	the song re-interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them . this might be a christmas album , but the music is not limited to only that time of year .
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the great sousa ! a must buy for any march lover !
1	great album ! i am in love !
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie . this album wasnt anything great . i hope the new movie will blow my sock off !
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download . i absolutely love this song , it ha good sound quality , but they cut off the entire last word/note ! it drive me crazy and really ruin the track .
0	the drifter are typical of many group of the era , with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member . lot of lawsuit usually resulted . the nostalgic listener , expecting an authentic trip down memory lane , is the loser . if you are looking for the real thing , you have to go to the source : atlantic record ( < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/only-in-america-atlantic-soul-classics/dp/b00260phvo/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > only in america : atlantic soul classic < /a > ) . this marvelous collection includes the original recording of great drifter song , a well a many other atlantic performer such a ben e. king , don covay , sam & dave and otis redding . it aint cheap , but the real thing seldom is .
1	i like this song there is not a lot i can say other than i like it and so do my friend
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label . the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin . the singer is brigitte fassbaender . warning regarding fassbaender . in da klangende lied , the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part . but in all the other piece in the two disc , the vocal are more prominent . it is therefore the case that in these other piece , the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most . fassbaenders singing style ( if you want to call it singing ) includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato . this bizarre , exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted , to be a perversion , and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition . when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording , it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed , irritated , and angry . in some kind of music , such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins , or in grindcore music , such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass , the distorted voice is the point of the recording , and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience . but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music . also , fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you . for this reason , i recommend only da klagende lied , but am not able to recommend the other piece on this 2-disc set . the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler , and they consist of da klagende lied , kindertotenlieder , de knaben wunderhorn , lied eines fahrenden gesellen ( all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ) , and ruckert leider ( all five song are here ) . only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation . this review provides a side-by-side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle . the rattle recording is slightly better , for reason disclosed below . this review also provides a side-by-side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn ( the song about the fish ) with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado . the abbado recording is slightly better , for the reason listed below . second-by-second account of waldmarchen . this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied , one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire . waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum . at the 6 second point , the french horn provide a short riff . then , at 18 second , the flute join in . the french horn resume at 23 second , and at 24 second , the reed and string join the fray . at 33 second , the french horn join in again , and here they play a real tune , not just a riff . at 50 second , the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch , and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch . at one minute and 37 second come a momentary crescendo . it is a big crescendo , but there is not any crash of cymbal . these timing are for the rattle recording . this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording , with the nit-picky exception that i list below . the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second , but the rattle recording start with music , not with any hum . comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle . the chailly timing is 28 minute and 8 second , while the rattle timing is 28 minute and 31 second . in the chailly recording , the tenor ( werner hollweg ) make his entrance at 5 min , 36 sec , singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire . mr. hollwegs voice is slightly tinny . in the rattle recording , the tenor ( robert tear ) make his entrance at 5 min , 23 second . robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding , somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff . thus , i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording . for reason unknown to me , the chailly recording ha a tenor ( werner hollweg ) and a bass ( andreas schmidt ) , while in contrast , the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone . the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea . the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann . there is no discernable difference to my ear , in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording . hochzeitsstuck . the chailly recording clock at 18:32 , while the rattle recording is 18:57. the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum , a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass , and blaring brass . this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off-stage band , which is much quieter than the on-stage orchestra . the off-stage band can be heard , for example , in the interval of 2:16 to 3:12. when the off-stage band is playing , the only other source of music is vocal soloist , at least for this interval of time . this movement also feature a chorus preference . for the following reason , i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied . the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume , and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic . in contrast , the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy . also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice , over the tinny voice of hollweg . the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff ( baritone ) and anne sofie von otter ( mezzosoprano ) , a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label . on the chailly recording , there are only three song , a i mentioned above , and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato . in the abbado recording , some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female . my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish , and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no . 2. anyway , this compare the fish song ( de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording . notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at 20-30 second and 60-65 second , and the five second donkey-like braying from clarinet that occurs at 60 second and again at 105 second . the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong . i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason . first of all , the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo . also , in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured , because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute , and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato . the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording . also , the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon , and to my ear , the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording . to reiterate these point , what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound , and the more easily discernable fluttery flute , donkey braying , and mysterious chinese gong . conclusion . the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony . a careful side-by-side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording . i did my own side-by-side comparison , and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado . da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition , and it ha been my favorite since the year 1972. it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old .

1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome .
1	love the work wish the cd had more track !
1	great ep
0	i really did not find any of it funny , not a single redeeming quality to be found . usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at . not the case with this one , it is just devoid of charm or humor . it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea . i wish i could un-listen to it , do not waste your time .
0	sorry @ the head and the heart but i just do not get it . i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money .
0	i downloaded this track by accident . this is the live version of the song . i wanted the original studio version .
0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album . though i do not prefer spanish singing , some song are nicely done . but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous 2 duet album . with all the great classic song to pick , why recycle the same song ? i do not get it .
1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love . i love the honest , open worship . if you enjoy bethel type worship , then you will love worshipmob . i can not wait for another cd by them .

0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around the starting line came . they sound exactly like nfg . which is not good either . and there lyric are so boring and lame . if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin , please note that i really wanted to like this album , and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii . for those who are die-hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you . i am not going to review each track , because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea . ever since untouchable , there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album , and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head , both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar . untouchable wa a good album , not great . mirror wa still decent , and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . however , a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album . i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue , and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . when you listen to their early work , the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue . with the release of untouchable , the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the 1950s . with each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus . this is not to say the album released since 2000 have been bad , they just are not worthy of a 5-star rating . this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two , but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio wave . doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? yes . doe he growl more ? sure . are the lyric memorable . no . doe the music stand out ? not really . i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material , but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge , and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . in 6 month , listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp3 player . they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great . i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression . either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul . the album is not terrible , but it is unremarkable and candidly , it is also forgettable . my $ .02
1	love it
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased . i will find something better . not worth it .
1	great inspirational music .
1	i like listening to demi lavatos music . she is pretty good . i bought it for my kindle fire hd . you should like it too .
0	i love him , not a much a he doe , but i have enjoyed all his music to this point . you can find song like this on any album in the genre , nothing wa added to the music world from this album .
1	yeah buffett .
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame a rape victim
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon-to-be christmas classic ! well done , p-unit !
0	for the elevator or dentist office . i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here . but i wa a big fan . and yes , i gave the cd several try , all the way through . even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album . it is just milk toast . dull , uninspired and uninspiring . sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm ( really ? ) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out , and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off . yes , mumfords voice is gorgeous , but not enough to save the album . hey , fame and fortune is tough , but they made it through 27. i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited .
1	attunement is a true miracle . a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid , spectacular sound . those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed . but in the lens of dembys all-encompassing camera obscura , attunement range from the raw , sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus . the texture are constantly changing , like the color and fragrance of a secret garden . you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before . such is the power of attunement . this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition ( spontaneous combustion ? . it doe smoke at time . the fire from the earth inner core ) a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure !
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral . and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion .
1	always liked simon & garfunkel .
1	yes ! yes ! yes !
0	i am sorry , i hate to be rude or insensitive . people like what they like i know , however , i have to say that this is the worst song ever ! the fact that ne-yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe . the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard . i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous , horrible lyric and nasally singing . how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once . the first time is enough torture , seriously ! the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good ! it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up . i like ne-yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired . this song suck badly ! i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h_ll this crap could be called music . many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it !
1	great music from a great series
