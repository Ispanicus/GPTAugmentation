0	i liked both of the single , undead and no . 5 , that came out a while back . i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping . based on the single , which were decent rap metal , i wa expecting a rap metal cd . but this cd actually ha 12 white boy gangsta rap track and 2 rap metal track . huge disappointment and totally not what i wa expecting . the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la , talk about cliche . i think it is fitting that the re-release of this cd is called desperate measure ( to make money .
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon-to-be christmas classic ! well done , p-unit !
1	this is a good song do not wa easy to download with no problem at all sure the album is good
1	fantastic voice that jive well with the retro sound . like a dark , smokey pink martini . i do not have five more word .
0	did not like this version of his . i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back-up singer . oh well .
0	the worst try-hard band i have ever heard - how did these turd get an album out ? oh yeah - rich parent . ugh , lovely . it suck , do not waste your money .
1	what is there not to like with billy currington . i excercise to must of done something right . easy slow so start with stretching then upper body movement . i have arthritis . so this is great for me .
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who follow christ . i wa hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party , but can not , it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric . if i would have heard the word of the song before i bought it , i would have not .
1	some of my favorite music from back in the 80 . brings back so many wonderful memory ! the cd arrived in perfect condition !
1	wonderful song ! great lyric and a really catchy tune . you will be singing this one even when it is not playing : ) let love explode and bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is surely alive he is living on the inside roaring like a lion !
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case .
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through .
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd ? i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright , but , being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album , i wa certainly looking forward to more than this . a were my pink floyd - loving friend who listened to it . sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album , but would work a add-on lead done live . i hate to think poorly of these guy , but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off-hand way .
1	classic al stuff . in his usual humorous style . early in al album every song is great .
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me . mean a lot !
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen to . i recomend it highly although i do not recomend the second set 100 more piano masterpiece .
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie , but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother . this audio encounter is not by the mayles , and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party . the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck . the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive .
1	-incredible scream -great melodic breakdown -incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is . you can tell this band doe their own thing/has their own style and doe not conform . that is what make them great . con : album is a little too short , some of the song sound similar
0	sanjaya wa entertaining on idol . but he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy . this song is terrible ! off-key warbling , non-melodic , soulless . pas this up asap !
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral . and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion .
1	forget ravel bolero . this is the most sensuous , evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone . it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace . share it with someone you love .
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album . monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement .
1	wonderful old song - not covered enough at all .
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin , please note that i really wanted to like this album , and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii . for those who are die-hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you . i am not going to review each track , because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea .
0	please get it off my kindle i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough those of u with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of .
1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again . she is back and this album outshines believe . cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful voice to send these song through the roof . song for the lonely will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today . alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible . when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track .
1	one of my favorite dylan album . a masterpiece !
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want . amazon . a little warning next time please . i still cant find the song i did order . anybody can help with this ? im going in circle here . secondly , the song wa annoying at first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy . cross between old beatles music and alternative rock . least it not filled with suicide , violence and cursing .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak , however , not stating this is 45 second long is almost misrepresenting itself . in fact , it is . listen to the free clip - you have heard 70 % of the interview . shame on you , amazon !
1	great song , long length . thought provoking . brings back good memory from the 90 . you will ask yourself . where wa i when i heard that ?
0	pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd . forgettable .
1	this song came out in the 90 and i remember having this cd at the time . this wa one of their big hit along with i want u. i love this song because the group came along with a new sound . they were in when grunge rock ruled , but along come savage garden , what a blessing . the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric , i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic , 80 , an 90 . a great band for those of u who whated something besides those grunge band .
0	art garfunkel ? his version wa much better , more relaxed , and much smoother . i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr. grobans range .
0	music wa too high i could not use the soundtrack . i tried with my soprano and they could not sing to the soundtrack .
1	this band is so good ! there last album wa good . this one is even better !
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flutist that i wa looking for . i wa very disappointed that it wa not !
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song . if this is a good a his song writing get , he need to set down the pen . god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single . i can not help but think of fergie when i hear this song . it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump . except , in this situation , there is a man singing it . it make my stomach churn a i think about it . are there no good male songwriter left in this country !
0	imo , this sound like something i couldve done with a toy saxophone . awful . listen to the preview . if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great , then go for it .
0	you can tell this is not an original , buy the dubbing and sound quality . i have and original jim stafford album from the 70 and this is not the same ouality of sound . suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england ,
1	the song re-interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them . this might be a christmas album , but the music is not limited to only that time of year .
0	i just do not get the hype about 50 cent . i listened to this , and i think he is a , excuse the pun , two-bit talent .
0	i love ne-yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around the starting line came . they sound exactly like nfg . which is not good either . and there lyric are so boring and lame . if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
0	what a lazy production from pink floyd a it is supposed last album . very disappointed .
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music . that is what i consider this . along with the postal service , music to fall asleep to .
1	when the name van mccoy come up , if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late 1970s , it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle . mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to # 1 on the billboard hot 100 in 1975 , and wa billboard # 22 most popular song of that year . fast forward a year to 1976 , where mccoy released another song with a similar , albeit lighter sound , called the shuffle .
0	i downloaded it thinking that i could use it and hear it . it wa lost in my harddrive somewhere and now i just wasted a $ 1.00
0	i wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not .
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music . it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star ( no danse macabre , and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete - just one part from each season ) . but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist . i highly recommend it !
1	wonderful music , a always by josh groban .

1	with their sophmore album , lifehouse ha defenitely improved . their sound ha matured and become so much better ( not that no name face wa bad ) . the album first single , spin , is very energetic and uplifting ( and the video made me dizzy ) . a few other track to note are anchor , which is a powerful song , am i ever gon na find out , which is incredibly catchy , take me away , another very powerful one , and the beginning , which is beautiful enough to make me cry .
0	i very rarely bother to write a review , unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something . unfortunately this is the latter . i have always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak , materialistic , egotistical , club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 year now . though every album ha had a different feel to it , i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound .
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album . i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them . so i will not spend the money to buy the entire album . when this song is available to download individually , let me know and you just might get a sale .
1	i love this album ! a very anointed project !
1	this wa a pretty good album , i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs ( that still belongs to to the pain ) , but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band , i would like to see them do more solo though . pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor , my two personal favorite on the album were pin & needle and never cared before .
1	love the work wish the cd had more track !
1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year . i really enjoyed listening to it . more than once .
0	did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a 50th class reunion power point presentation .
1	this is a great song with a great message . yolanda adam is one of the best gospel/inspirational singer ever . king kong aint got nothing one her ! ( lol )
1	lady gaga - cheer to you darling , this song is fabulous ! i highly recommend you buy it . i did and i will never regret it . this is a song you can listen to over and over again . wonderful ! : )
1	i like this song there is not a lot i can say other than i like it and so do my friend
1	jojos voice is truly gifted ! she ha comeback with great force and can not wait for further music from her in the future ! this tringle is great !
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley , which you do not know unless you are into the whole post-hardcore movement . apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic-sounding song , so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark . the song keep the lyric , maintaining the dirty feeling of it all , but it turn up the rock , and really make it a rockin song , causing it to end up a really weird , but fun combination for various party .
1	great song . i had no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter !
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	this is great sound and pink is good in everything that she sings . if you love this like i do get all of her music .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
0	it is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it . it wa just some breathing noise and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy . i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling . would not reccomend
0	i came to this wanting to like it . i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever . i have all of rogers solo work , seen him a few time back in the 80 on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour . i am a fan . my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak . if life is really that bad , get a puppy ! i mean , i find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this - i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash .
1	dark , but great song . and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar . liked it , good value for the price and convienient to download . i love amazon .
0	every now and then , great artist miss the target . queen had hot space van halen had vh iii this is on that scale of bad . it is sing songy long boring choral moment . it is melodramatic story telling . it is the greatest collection of technically gifted artist playing simple uninteresting part . do you remember asia ? yeah it is that bad .
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download . i absolutely love this song , it ha good sound quality , but they cut off the entire last word/note ! it drive me crazy and really ruin the track .
1	love bfs ! and they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are . again ! the bitch song ha always been a favorite of mine . and i am so excited to see it back on the track list ! it is great hearing that song . new and musically improved ! : ) stacys mom just make me laugh . because for some weird reason people have thought that they have been singing it for year . and now all of those people are correct haha . and i have never done anything like this is just typical bfs stuff !
0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd . what a waste of money . could these song be sung any slower ? very disapointed . l
0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past . the word of god renews my spirit daily !
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive , it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office . one minute you are straining to hear the word , the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down . susan boyle voice is low , almost a mumble , and she sound like a little girl- not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection . i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it .
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd . i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand . with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere . i really do not know how to describe how i feel . it is not bad music , it is not a bad album . but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band - i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it .
1	jackies voice ha really matured . a other reviewer have said and i agree with , this is hauntingly beautiful . this being the first single from her new album , i really can not wait to hear the other song from the album .
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly . after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post-2004 , they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence . unfortunately , this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea , resulting in track that i would never expect from this band . destroyer already start this off on an iffy note , with it rhythm section going for the big , loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena .
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra , with mary martin doing the singing . that is the plus , a it is always a pleasure to hear her . why should not i is the third standard ( or maybe it is an almost standard ) from cole porter jubilee , and definitely a favorite song of mine . this is a very good straight version , without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it . the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse , which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric ( e .
1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier . watch the speed a it is easy to get lost in the music .
0	if it where possible , i would leave zero star ! one of the worst album i have ever purchased .
1	louie prima and keely smith , the king and queen of the 50 vega lounge circuit . included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in just one of those thing .
0	i do not understand how this album won award . i would ask for my money back if i could .
0	the recording is not good . the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance . i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one . i think i made a mistake of choosing this version . his you tube music ha better recording than this one .
1	this song is awesome . i am not a huge fan of three day grace , but this is by far my favorite .
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer , but to me , songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here , along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level . i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit - that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength . this album is more like day in the life ditty .
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music . most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it . i do .
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of 52 year . what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer .
1	my kid love this song ! it is so much fun to listen to and sing along with . bonus , i do not get tired of hearing it .
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the original artist it wa a big scam it wa a remake by some artist i never heard of
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite . his first three album are off the chart . but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop . what a bad album . ive waited this long for this . i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound . he need a producer , some one to make dope beat . this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it . im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more .
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance . doe not mesh well with the other instrument . need a lot of work .
1	i love this song ! download wa smooth and simple . burn to disc wa fine . will download more music from amazon .
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
0	actually , it did not . the first tune wa nice , but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all . if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake , and i just found it too irritating .
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and did not want to buy an album with a bunch of music i did not want .
0	i love this song , but the amazon music app will not play it or save it to my phone .
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube . loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep . had one of the best sleep in a long time . maybe it wa a one off , but this wa encouraging . time will tell .
0	i downloaded this track by accident . this is the live version of the song . i wanted the original studio version .
0	when wilson first broke into country music , her hit such a redneck woman , homewrecker and here for the party were cutting , fresh and brash . now her latest single , do not do me no good is just uninspired- it sound like the 101th song out there on country radio . an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is . wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself . she should just take her advice when she sings on this track , yeah i know it aint right/to sit around all night and let your memory/get the best of me .
1	this is a very good sounding mp3 download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 piece . mine only downloaded 100 .
0	not my kind of music , downloaded them for a funeral
1	this is one of the greatest tune of the year , if not - ever . however , i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it , but it dosent , so now i get to buy another copy of this cd .
0	nothing of great interest . mostly a vanity project . quite disappointing , really .
0	i think it is so good message is great i just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star .
1	i love the song white christmas . michael and shania make a very good duet couple . very good christmas song for anyone .
1	sound like old school veruca salt . recommended .
0	not many good song . a mediocre effort from a big talent
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome .
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy . i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one . sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample . well this wa the only full version of her retail album , so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it . i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored ! this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store .
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label . the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin . the singer is brigitte fassbaender . warning regarding fassbaender . in da klangende lied , the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part . but in all the other piece in the two disc , the vocal are more prominent . it is therefore the case that in these other piece , the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most .
0	purchased this and it never did show up in my account .
0	really misleading . it is more of a 10 minute show than a full length one . lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it .
1	love this song . nate is a great praise and worship singer .
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. you are husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
0	richie sounded good when i heard him on howard , but the cd sound overproduced and too electronic . very disappointed and would not recommend .
1	a mellow , infectious , romantic love song , not only for the female specie , but most definitely for guy who are truly in love .
1	heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song . brought back memory when i wa younger .
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan , so when i saw a cd that we did not yet own , i wa excited to surprise my husband with it . however , when i received it , there wa a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language . i wa shocked ! nowhere on amazon description of this product doe it indicate this . i am shipping it back right away .
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be . a lot of the song i have never heard before .
0	sorry all you dude who will flip over this but using god name that way over and over is childish and ignorant ! like the uneducated idiot that can not make a sentence without a foul word in it . seriously guy it unintelligent !
0	very old school , but wa looking for the song for a frend
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life , including a year in vietnam . i used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little . but . . .i really do not think ten new song is all that great . i am glad someone gave it to me , tho .
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the 70 , but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame . amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music . who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd ?
0	very frustrating ! you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song . unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy , from the same band doing the same song , only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it ! wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than 20 second long in a part of the song that might be helpful !
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. really take me back to that time , really good song .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation . check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion .
0	the song is fine , but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro , like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny .
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor , his voice is a example of perfection . his story make his music even more touching . i hope he get the attention of american . his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart .
1	great album wet dream , and hello are definitely stand out song for me . hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja-rule day back where mc were willing to sing their own hook and i think j. cole doe it well on the track he doe it .
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new york : big sophisticated city image .
0	i will not marry you , woman ! it is rude to keep asking .
1	my wedding song thirty-two year ago
0	after a couple of day , song refused to play . had to download from another server .
1	great voice ! this is a wonderful album to listen to . well worth the $ 5
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i.e . passenger . it is not and wasnt worth keeping . i tossed it in the trash . what a waste of $
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass . this portion is so moving , i can listen to it over and over .
1	for country music fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the music of schuyler , knobloch and overstreet , judy rodman , and schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt , this cd is a must for your collection . this cd cover most of the major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd . judy rodman , who wa a minor success ( and mtm record only artist before folding ) in the early to mid 80 ha several of her best known hit on this release .
1	i think that 50 cent newest cd get rich or die tryin is great . he is the hottest thing on the street right now . everyone is bumppin 50. get rich or die tryin got alot of cameo and it sound great it better than ja rule ! haha
1	i love bronn journey harp music . thanks .
0	back in the very early 90 , i had this ( the cassette tape version ) and thought it wa amazing . until i bought the cd recently , i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me . it wa almost painful to listen to , and i remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music ! i would only recommend this for laugh or a 90 nostalgia night .
1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever . the movie is great , and so is the soundtrack . kevin spacey doe a great job all around !
0	i downloaded this song because it wa free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned 6. she love it . we listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip . it brought me to tear to hear the old song that shaped my spirituality when i wa young , and i am so thrilled i can share it with my daughter .
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video . i did not like the rap in the middle , did not seem to fit the song .
0	this is not the full song , it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration . i actually want my money back . do not buy !
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station . i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood ( iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station ) . anyhow from my perspective , see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im ready to aim .
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in . not good to work out to .
0	this 1981 recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me , one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest , silliest , and corniest the label ha to offer in new york ( with the exception of the three song i already mentioned . ) this recording wa of course , an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune .
1	that voice , this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe . love is grand , so appreciate it . because everything fade away .
0	nancy sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault ! she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon .
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it .
1	love this song , reminiscent of grover washington jr. great style and warmth .
0	bought by mistake . not among kelly best ( check out ne-yos song of the same name ) .
1	i like listening to demi lavatos music . she is pretty good . i bought it for my kindle fire hd . you should like it too .
1	awesome cd . listen all the way through .
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy .
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album , which i think is great ! this one did not deliver like that one for me but i am still listening to it . i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening . usually for me when an album doe not hit me right away , it will a little later , well see .
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode . then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song . i wa sold . that wa when i decided to purchase this song . she reminds me of a japanese shakira . the donde estan los ladrones shakira : soulful , gritty , heart-thread tugging , soul speaking singer .
0	awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [ lp ] is pretty bad ! my copy ha pitting on a couple song so the needle jump . the fun side of buying vinyl i guess . then when i go online to download with the given code i am told that it not valid a the code ha already been redeemed . total fail !
1	you have to consider , though , that music of this kind sort of play itself , and a far a i am concerned , the organist must just not get in the way of it . walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue , which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard , and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned . towards the end , i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed , still keeping within a modest forte .
0	7 second of what , the hunger game intro ? do not get this download . you will regret it . need i say more .
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast , bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word . can not wait for the album .
1	i lost this song from my mp3 album . i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me . this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago .
1	there is just something about him that take me away . he is got this voice that is so unique that talk to your soul .
0	i purchased the mp3 but could not download it . i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again . it doe not work and all the thing they told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to contacting them . they were no help and i am out .99 ( big deal ) but still have no song .
1	the story wa good . the music wa so so . we hail from new jersey . and grew up listening to the four season . we used to follow them intensely . wherever they were appearing . we know their sound . the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong . he wa singing to falsetto . you know over doing . this is our opinion , but then again we are jersey girl !
0	the song is great . but , this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song , making it impossible for me to listen to .
1	there were a couple of top 40 song from this album , but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound .
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack , never in my life . never thought i would , for that matter . but , after watching tron : legacy , i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie , but i loved the music ! it is amazing , a this review title say . : ) i usually always have playing on my mp3 player thousand foot krutch and fm static , my favorite band . so i thought it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff ( since tfk is hard rock ) , but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning .
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic . unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up . i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl , but the seller did list this a good condition yet 90 % of it wa unplayable . very disappointed .
0	ok cd . a few good song but not worth the buy . obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend , this will work
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube . beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound . plus i love the disco beat . little known now and little info about them anymore . they were popular in europe in the early 80 . i think they were english but played a lot in germany . do not think they did much in the u .
1	i wa happy to see that this track wa offered for sale , a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd . i feel that , with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording , this is the best recording of the show out there .
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness ! do i really need to say anything ? if your a jimi fan , buy it and listen !
0	would not download . error in file name .
0	sorry @ the head and the heart but i just do not get it . i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money .
0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to alexa
0	product sucked got it and it skip very badly to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad .
1	great song better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season 1
1	tragically , it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world , the great natalie cole . but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie , is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart . something that many of her diva like rihanna , beyonc , britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all . instead , they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone .
0	what a rip off of katy perry . wow ! how no one ha noticed is unbelievable !
0	think i deserve my money back . this song wa labeled a clean , yet upon playing the entire song , there are several profane word . wasted my money because i can not listen to it .
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1 ? mr. big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit . he is so emotional . it must be from the bottom of his heart
1	well it is wreckx-n-effect . what more need to be said . mr teddy riley did it yet again . with this group made up of his brother & cousin he killed the 90
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your private chopped off . thats all i have to say , no 50 cent , it is not my birthday , and we are not gon na party like it my birthday , especially not to your crappy music . have a nice day
1	he is a young george straight . nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music . i hope he ha a great career .
1	i love this song ! nick voice is so hot ! it is always my ringtone around valentine day ! i do wish him and jess were still together but i still love it !
1	beautifully written and sung . a song to listen to over and over . sound quality is good especially with headphone , oh yeahhhh .
1	exactly what i wa hoping for ! heard the title song , you+me , and love that sound . lucky for me all the song sound just a good . listen to it everyday .
1	great song ! band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well ! recommend to people who like heavy metal , just not cookie monster metal !
0	not such a great cd . only one selection meet my expectation .
1	another big streisand winner album . great collaboration duo .
0	i love the original video recording , but this version add way to much instrument background music . make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song .
0	very disappointed in this cd . it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song , too annoying to listen too .
0	this should be a lot better . however it is not . do not waste your money . sorry brian
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far ! can not wait to hear the rest of their album . the boy are awesome and so talented !
1	even switchfoots b-sides are amazing ! any fan would love this ep
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret , or even fire garden . but gospel and blue type singing ? . kind of a turn off . i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album . and that hurt to say .
0	very disapointing , sound like it is playing to slow . obvisouly a recording problem .
0	not only is she a horrible singer . she support cop killer . she is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video . please do not support her !
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol , boring !
1	prince wa ahead of his time on this one . my grandchild like it and the older one understand it too .
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship . it is not cry , but mere acceptance of the inevitable . toni braxton sound beautiful in it .
0	no rocky top ? ! ? why bother ? that is like warm beer & cold pizza , close but not quite .
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead . even worse , they might mistake it for the original . collection like this need more one-star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them .
1	classic redman . glad to see him back
0	ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information . wa not like the picture . returned 1st one and ordered a second which wa identical to the first . also wa returned .
0	the background is not a background ! you can listen the kid singing
1	i could not wait for bruno to drop his new album . i love his style . i grew up listening to different genre of music . my mom wa r & b . dad loved funk/soul and all true 80 baby should love new jack swing . he wa able to incorporate all of it on 1 album . hand down a masterpiece . whole album on repeat .
0	package wa sent back originally because it wa too damaged . i had to re-order the product and when i received it the case wa severely damaged any ] way .
0	rip teleka . this man took your life . i am sorry that people think he some kind of god . but your god will bring you justice someday !
0	disappointed . poor subject matter , poor quality .
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here . been a slipknot fan since the beginning . all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree . but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion . it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal . most cd grow on ya a time go . but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clip in a song or two .
1	i did not like it at first . after listening to it a few time , i got it . it is beautiful . lanny is a musical genius .
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to . 1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to .
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan , but i love this new song . it modern , clean , and just a great song . if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album , i think it going to be great .
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
0	pearl jam is the band that basically told mtv to f- off after their first album - nirvana is the band that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout , pearl jam got huge because of their music & they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated , phony fake band ever - pearl jam is truly the greatest band ever , pearl jam stuck by their word , cobain never did fact : cobain used to call mtv & tell mtv to play nirvana music video more
0	just do not like it , i took it just to check it out and i found out i do not like it .
1	billy curringtons album is great . it is one of the best album i have ever heard . billy is going to become one of the top artist in the next few year . every one should buy this album !
1	. but not the people that sold it to me . it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front . very disappointed . : (
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel , the da song soon ! and narration by chuck smith . really , if you have shotgun angel , there is little reason to buy this . if you do not have shotgun angel , get it instead . if you are buying this for the song soon ! ( which is the weakest song on it ) get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead . if you are buying this for the narration , it is not worth it . i can not criticize the biblical passage , though not particularly well read ; but the interpretive part is not well done .
1	at the age of 66 and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much . i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her . this wa one of those song . in all there wa 11 song that i picked out . i will have to tell you is wa some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it wa more then worth it . after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level .
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this . would never listen to it ( and i tried ) .
1	this wa a well received gift . can not go wrong with john lennon anything .
0	i want a new online music store , i want a new music store , one that do not just sell mp3s , one that will sell me original cd quality downloads , one that will take the time to respect the music , one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should . seriously bought one single just to test it out , cause i do not want to pay $ 40 , for the original cd ( reprint ) . i am not a audio snob , but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup .
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round . it is so soothing , yet intense at the same time . the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece . i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful , graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent .
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the 90 and 2000s . these song are a great mix of catchy tune , fun lyric , and biblical truth . furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together . the highlight of the album for me is it is alright ( for lazarus ) . i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry .
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort . i find it boring . i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only 2 or 3 likable song out of 14. that is not what i wanted . i wanted 6-8 track that were very good not just 2-3. of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer . but this difference is sound went the wrong way . everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it . i have listend to this album 6 or 7 time and still am not too thrilled .
1	awesome value ! this is a great mix of classic christmas tune , instrumental and vocal , and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party . for $ .99 there is no better value .
1	great album - can not wait to hear more from this group !
1	i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better . the lyric , vocal , instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen .
1	dr. octagon paramedic fetus of the east with priest , i am from the church of the operating room . with the strike support scalpel since the holocaust , i do indeed in greed explore meet the patient . back to broom with the nurse with the voodoo curse . holding up office light standing at huge height . back and forth , left wing , swing to north , east and south with blood pouring down your mouth . i come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope , listen to your heartbeat , delete beep beep beep !
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful , full baritone , and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful , timeless song , but i found myself surprisingly disappointed . he is done something to change his technique , and he often sound nasally , especially when he sings word with the e vowel . i think he is been ill-advised in this latest singing technique , and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method !
1	my 14 month old baby love this song . quality is great . i wanted exactly same sinsong , singed by same singer etc . and i think this is it !
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan . i own all of their previous album . therefore , i wa all excited for this album to come out , even though , i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait . i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better . they are not ! i would/will not waste any money on this album . it is a very big disappointment , especially judging it based on their previous work . they can and should be putting out better work than this .
1	this is great and interesting music . this is music that is both creative a well a being entertaining . i look forward to listening to future music contribution .
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back . his version is amazing . if you buy his version through february , proceeds go to charity ! if you buy this version , you will be supporting glee , who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit . no , thank you !
1	fabulous music , love the violin and the piano in the background . the music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me . one of the best cd ever !
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer . the beat are pretty nice . if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat , that have a very raw/rough feel and sound . the right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal , etc on top . if , however , someone is looking for larger selection of beat , some with music , they could check out heat beat vol 1 by royalty free , then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league , or something like that .
1	very good centering music to maintain balance .
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor : when i first heard her 4 or 5 year ago , i thought , wow ! she is really unique and awesome ! . then came her next record and i thought . hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it . she ha managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight record . i think that is a record or something ( pun intended ) . i just want to tell her , yea , we have got it , you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million time for effect .
0	i went through day of singing this over and over .
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style . i wa very disappointed . his sound doe not work with these song . it is not enjoyable . the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic , which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound , but the choice of song wa wrong . sorry bob !
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd . a a collector of original cast album of flop musical , i regretfully bought that cd . it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album . the insert came straight off of a computer printer , the first band wa silent ( the actual recording started on the second band ) leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement .
0	great music . the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk . it wa very difficult to play my copy . like most people , i have more then one device to play a cd in . this cd doe not work in most of them .
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the great sousa ! a must buy for any march lover !
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app
1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love . i love the honest , open worship . if you enjoy bethel type worship , then you will love worshipmob . i can not wait for another cd by them .
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song . it really resonates with the pain i am current healing from . thank you , plumb .
0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf
0	i am so disappointed in the last 3 i bought b/c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song , rearranged or in a different language . this is very poor representation especially for a new group . whoever made those decision should be fired . their objective should b to make new follower , not loose them . i have purchased 15 dvd a present and 2 new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label .
0	despite this being a label album , it really just another flame album . v rose only get one track to herself , and it the forgettable threw it all away . ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference , the label ha stuck with their two artist . yes , a lot of various artist from reach record , cross movement , and beyond are brought in to add flavor , but it flame project without question . and it ok , but it not a good a flame usual stuff , which ha been declining a of late in my opinion .
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago ; considering the book came out in 1993 , i wa so happy to find the music in cd format . because i know the story behind the music , i do not know if the music would stand alone . it is gorgeous , ha a variety of flavor to it . it sound like song from a musical . i would recommend getting both the book and the cd . the book is not a picture book , per se , but a story with illustration . the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone .
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd . wish i would have listened to it first . not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me . there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to . maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me . it just blew me away right from the start .
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie . this album wasnt anything great . i hope the new movie will blow my sock off !
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap-rock band , in detail . i am not one of those people . for me , this genre is a side dish , not the main course , but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it . new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album , numb : the same anger , the same desperation , the same hard edge . but i think that frontmen tac and hash , while working from this genre , wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance .
1	attunement is a true miracle . a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid , spectacular sound . those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed . but in the lens of dembys all-encompassing camera obscura , attunement range from the raw , sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus . the texture are constantly changing , like the color and fragrance of a secret garden .
1	an outstanding collection of song by a group out of vega , they are featured on the soundtrack for resident evil extinction track 15 contagious i have not heard a new band this good in year . hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music , but these guy . these guy changed all that . thank you adam , ricky , kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius , i look forward to more of your stuff ! check them out on their myspace page [ .
1	louisville represent . love supporting artist from my home state . laid back soul . you got ta listen to this .
1	you can b. sure that this tune is still great ! get it now ! it will bring back old memory , and sound all new at the same time .
0	i do not think anyone over the age of 16 like ( or can relate to ) nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed ( playing gig in a band doe not count ) . once you become become of that age , the most important thing are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school . clearly , the people here are the pre-teen target audience . look at the misspelling , look at the abbreviation of even simple word , and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves .
0	i agree with eric , who reviewed this cd , like him i find this cd not too attractive . other than the hit song heard it all before , sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album . the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor , which could be labeled a light cuisine . a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good . i would not dare to compare her to kelly price , she might have a potential , but she is still got a long way to go to get there .
1	this is an absolute classic . it brings me back to the day when michael wa but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
1	i love her music , it is great to listen to . she is one of the great singer in the world right now . i love playing her song .
1	a good , clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series . to hear it would always take me back to the early 70 . now , it reminds me of that tv series .
1	this is a good track from my teen year . it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood . i have not heard any of their other music , but this is a good track to get ; )
1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song . i just had to get it for her .
1	this is my favorite version of valerie : it ha personality , class , great performing style . oh , it is beautiful . i realy wish that it would be her signature song , not the i am not going to rehab , ( no , no , no , ) one .
1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of u .
0	one song for $ 9.99 ? i guess it is my fault that i did not read the product description , but i wa under the impression , for that price , that i wa getting a full length cd .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	thank you so much , it is fantastic , i truly appreciate it , very very peaceful ! it is amazing the way it make you feel !
0	ordered and paid for 3 song . only one song down loaded . amazon site said all 3 were down loaded . my e-mail to them for help wa never answered . customer service suck !
1	this is terry fator . what more can you ask for ? a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan .
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone . i just love to listen to him sing
1	stylistically , i love all type of music . but , how do i classify fireflights album , for those who wait album - is it indie , is it rock - i do not know ? but , what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work ! drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band - with fireflight , there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person - and , the driving vocal of pat benatar , and pop musicality of the go-gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs .
1	the star say it all , do not know what else i could put other than i love it .
1	incredible musical talent and so inspirational ! love love love it !
0	disappointed . nothing like their first track .
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song , it is a little different but it is okay
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place . have yet to open the case because it is a gift , but hopefully it is ok .
0	got a free download for purchasing cd from amazon . tried to download , but wa not successful . tech support from amazon non-existent . i am sure it wa opperator error , but they only give you one chance . i have let other free download offer expire . not worth the hassle . love billy joel , have album , cassette , and cd .
0	total ripoff ! this is not the whole song , it is like a 30 second sound bite from the song . i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for $ 1.29 . save yourself a buck and do not buy this .
1	love this song . start my day out with it .
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you , but it is just an instrumental version of the song . it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything . i wish i had known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want .

1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70 . other hit song by them were hey , nineteen , rikki do not lose that number , deacon blue and do it again .
0	not to much into the hard rock sound .
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for . not much to say about a music mp3
1	bought this before going to see the show . well done . the show wa awesome ! looking forward to reliving the show with this cd . came with a digital copy via amazon musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise . the cd is new and work great too .
1	you can not help but tear up when listening to this song . it is an amazing song amd lea made it even better !
0	love the band , but there only one good song on this release . seriously , anything that say feat . in it is passe and unoriginal . if you are so good , why do you need help ? it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together , and now everyone is doing it . seriously , keep the dj out . none of the good one know wtf they are doing . i will pas on this one . collide is much better , and 13 song at that .
0	love the song . hate the download process through amazon . i do not want your player amazon . you made the normal download link to small , like fine print . took me too long to figure out . made me grouchy .
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week . deftones is one of my favorite band .
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ! ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song ! keep up the good work
1	always a classic song . great quality , too .
0	the whole mp3 is just noise , not good noise , not even a lot of noise but noise . what a bunch of hooey . do not click on this one . the only reason i wa looking wa i tried steve g. jones and in two night have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choice when eating . it is also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep . but this one - boo hiss stay away . glad i only wasted $ .99 . whew .
0	it sounded good on the clip . after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be .
1	my student ad i love this song and the video that made u go and buy it . it is upbeat and fun and totally appropriate for everyone !
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music . i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment . i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition . hey ry , stick to music for everyone .
1	this is a favorite tune . thanks for the quick delivery to my kindle . i have enjoyed the tune many time and am still enjoying playing it .
0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case ! i am livid !
0	i never ordered this . i hope it wa free .
1	awesome song and it is a timeless classic . i dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa ! maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again . i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year ! i feel ripped off and so disappointed !
0	this is terrible . anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever . it so overplayed & way overrated .
0	censored version , but it had the explicit label
1	grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled time it is no suprise . but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love . the theme song deputy this in a haunting way .
0	for the elevator or dentist office . i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here . but i wa a big fan . and yes , i gave the cd several try , all the way through . even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album . it is just milk toast . dull , uninspired and uninspiring . sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm ( really ?
0	when i bought this dvd i wa expecting to get the famous cali lifestyle 2 dvd . instead i got the audio cd with a small sample of creeper present cali lifestyle 2. the small sample dvd only contains about 4 minute of video footage from creeper cali lifestyle 2 dvd . if you want the full dvd contact cali finest production . you can also buy the full dvd just a long it doe not contain the audio cd . i wa very dissapointed with this purchase .
0	basically my sister ( 16 year old ) is listening to this garbage in the other room , and it is aggravating ; i do not like shopping at the mall , and this music is teleporting me there . it is the definition of insipid , and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy , and thus spending dough . in other word , this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience .
0	i absolutely love this song ! however , the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible . it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it . it did only cost $ .25 so i guess i will live with it .
1	i saw ruben win on american idol , love his singing .
1	have 3 of their cd and love all three . love how they bring some old song back to new life god is great !
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work , yet one of his best . a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook . it is unique , it is honest and it is meaningful . the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate , a bottle of wine and quiet evening . i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this .
0	wow . a christmas album featuring a rhodes ! ? i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room , so i wa elated to see this cd . but it is not played on a rhodes . it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard , complete with cheezy drum track . it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano . what a disappointment . all the song are very stiff , a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live . i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title .
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file . i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file/windows medium of my pc . now i can not load the song onto my android phone . i tried over and over again . the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer . will someone call or email me and straighten this out .
1	like steampunk ? well , this is electro-swing - and about half of the electro-swing album i find , i would call steampunk themed music . caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro-swing album that i have found . i highly recomend it . be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that is what i like about it ( it make it a bit more timeless ) . it is fantastic for driving , or background music at party . enjoy !
1	best cd i bought in a year . i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing .
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased . i will find something better . not worth it .
0	quality of recording is not perfect ? * %
0	i have been a big boc fan since the 1970s , and have gotten most of their album along the way , but imaginos wa one that got away from me . i have seen many online comment about how great it is , and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction . so , when this reissue wa released , i had to pick it up . well . it really doe not do it for me , i am afraid . the problem is that , first of all , it doe not sound like a boc album , and , a i recently discovered , it is not .
1	love the song it is so uplifting and i play it three or four time a day just to get moving !
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not . either way , like it or not , once you hear it , it is stuck in your head . i am one of those who like it , hence , that is why i downloaded it . it may not be the greatest song ever done , but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick .
0	something my pocket purchased and played
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing . best of all , why should i be scared of you ? is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more . dig it .
0	problem is not the music . but they apparently sent u a blank . four different cd player and not a one can read it . holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track .
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber . this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way , and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother . very inspirational !
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement . always disappointing . be forewarned . it wa revealed in very small print .
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap . i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted . it wa adverized a being sold on amazon . i decided to buy it . so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon . but it wa not the same version ! only one verse wa in english . i felt extremely disappointed ! i wanted the english version so very much . but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what i wa led to believe i wa buying : the english version of veni sante spiritus !
1	love this song ! can picture the scene a it play out . a favorite every time i hear it ! thank you !
0	great song , but the download version is only 128kbps . why is no higher quality version available ?
