1	here is another release from a band that had been dormant for year , so here is the verdict : monotheist is just pure greatness . i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost , and while there is some experimentation in here to a greater degree , it all work organically to achieve some scary result . the album is also full of slow , crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut , which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience you will ever come across .
0	sound quality very low ! but a great classic song !
1	easy to learn and good song for a praise team , and a child choir get you blessing ! it great !
0	definitely not his best work . song either to rap or slow . nothing like his last 2 album . it ha to grow on me or a big waste of money .
1	what can i say , a massively favorite song . to get the favorite recording of this i had to purchase instead of use amazon prime streaming , but . it lead my mellowing out playlist . it also is that song from the famous volvo split commercial .
1	i love the brass opening this song . make me want to walk up to my wife and dance .
1	i always have . first heard it when it came out . this time i bought it s a gift for someone else .
0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place . if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i wa you will be very disappointed . at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing . other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad . i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album . i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor .
0	very disappointed . the song i really want it are not on here . but it is still a good cd . if i had known my song were not here i would not have purchased it .
1	a a worship leader i look forward to every new release from chris tomlin . each new project will contain song that , in time , become the cornerstone of our worship set . i have listened to burning light almost non-stop for the past several week and i believe this is one of tomlins strongest effort to date . listen to this project for a couple of day and you will not be able get the tune to whom shall i fear ? out of your head . we incorporated his rendition of crown him with many crown ( majesty ) on easter sunday morning and it wa very moving .
1	i wanted more of their debut album and got it . oh , of course it is not just rehash , but it is more of -and improvement on- their excellent sound , voice , beat , lyric . loved it upon first listen .
1	awesomeness love this song very inspiring and heart felt , i could listen to it all day it make my heart so filled with the spirit .
1	great soulful delivery on every song included in this project .
0	i never ordered or received this . why is this listed under my purchase , is it just one song or the whole album ?
0	do not buy this . not the actual song and is only a partial 30 sec long .
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard . she is also one of the most under-rated songwriter in the country . the story wa a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90 that included jennifer kimball . the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were/are inspired , and at time , their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear . my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine ( from story - angel in the house ) and eye in the sky ( from jonatha brooke - back in the circus ) .
0	i had to pay to listen to this song even tho i am a prime member and it is prime music !
0	i must have been one of the unlucky one that got a flawed cd . it skip like crazy . also , the plastic cd case came apart when opening . needle to say it wasnt a stress-free experience .
1	such a beautiful track . i come back and listen to this at least once a month .
1	this is nice song from my day of growing up in the 70 and still is a good song .
0	can not say that there is anything particularly memorable on this cd . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruise and this song doe it for me , it brings back all the memory
0	wrong cd in case . case cracked . high price .
0	weak vocal , weak instrumental . they clearly have lowered the key for several song yet joseph sound like he is straining . he sound like he is lying on his back with a collapsed lung . where is the donny osmond version that i love ? other version of this soundtrack are 5 star . this one is terrible .
1	product delivered a described . ship time wa expected .
1	these song take me way back and i feel like i am right there with him when he sings . the song are uplifting .
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year . that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album . i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened . now this . eric adam doe not sing lyric , it sound like he is saying them . he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case .
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual . not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying , she actually sound like she is trying . id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day . i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture . please , do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist . i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do .
0	i am a huge matisyahu follower , and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like . i will keep it simple , this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream . i like the song sunshine a lot , but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect . it is pretty depressing i am writing this review right now .
1	i mean seriously , if you do not know and love this song , you either should not be listening to the door or something is wrong with you . i know it college music these day , but all the same .
0	i love the classic moonglows recording . so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl . oops - i downloaded i wa wrong and it wa completely not the original doo wop version of the song . this version ha a strong background track , it is highly produced , it is just off . this is just my taste , but the new version of the tune wa awful and not what i wa looking for at all . anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these .
1	nice mellow song about reminiscing about day gone by what could have been if feeling between two people had been in sync .
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album , 0304 , take notice that all artist : writer , actor , musician , painter , etc. , etc , have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate . artist like jewel have to project different image twenty-four seven , whether it is their look and/or work . moreover , change can sometimes be difficult to accept , but that is life . nothing stay the same , everything change .
1	prince . wa . one . of . the . greatest . of . all . time . and . i. love . his . music
0	wtf is this trash . this album suck . the weekend killin you
1	what can i say ? the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid , original and unique . i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl . then , i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me & you , cherri denniss hit i love you . finally , he put out his first self-titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum . there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved .
0	this is by far the worst christmas album i have ever heard . sound like he wa drunk when he recorded this . even if someone gave this to me i would not want this in my collection .
0	i would rate this cd a just ok. for the money there are better sounding version out there . this ha the uk mix which sound flat and lifeless . it ha 4 bonus track , ironically from the u lp , which are already on the album . a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like - i will get you & baby it is you . i give it 2 star out of a possible 5 .
1	i love this song and it wasnt available on itunes ! amazon had it and for cheap
1	found it very easy to purchase directly from my kindle , love it . look forward to purchasing more song in the future
0	the recording ha a very low volume . when mixing with other recording , song from this cd are recognizably low in volume , can hardly hear it . good song , bad volume on the cd . anyone know how to turn up the recording volume of mp3s ?
1	christina and blake sound wonderful together ! who would have guessed it . : )
1	i really liked this album when it first came out . one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch . do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor . it is hard to explain . each song can hold it is own . even though david soul is best known a an actor/director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one .
0	sound like rap and i do not care a bit for it
1	another get out of your seat raise your hand and praise god song . this song touch the heart and the spirit
1	i love everything she ha ever done . i periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one .
0	i for some reason do not like this song at all , i find it very annoying . how do i delete this song off my play list . lol
1	it is one of my favorite son from the 80
1	leon cut up , adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune . the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album . also , you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly , stylized singing style on many of his recording ( not that there is anything wrong with that ! ) it is just a refreshing change for his fan .
0	this is one of the worse gospel compilation i have heard . this ha nothing to do with gospel . it is a mix-match of melody , poorly played .
1	heard this on a cable tv play list and had to find it ! had never heard it before and i am glad i did !
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast , at least for me , with seemingly everything entertaining ( news program , comedy monologue , tv show ) around u hop , skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) . it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye . but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up ?
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
0	i do not know if it is amazon fault , but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp3 is bad . too much treble , muddy in the midrange , and the bass is lacking , or maybe it is just overshadowed by the treble . listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ears- literally , not figuratively- hurt . i am so thankful for program like audacity ( sound manipulation program ) so i can balance it out myself , but i should not have to .
0	far too sappy . vastly overproduced . where is the rawness and fire of the earlier day ? a tremendous dissapointment . the only good thing about it is i do not own it . a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic . boy did i ever get the short end .
1	i fell in love with ann wilson the first time i heard dreamboat annie . 36 year later , ann wilson sound even better . wether you are a heart fan , or have never heard the group before , this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll .
0	i am sure he ha other good cd , but i have not found it yet .
1	i recommend this product to anyone who enjoys barbra streisand and the movie , the way we were . i chose this because i love her voice and i like the song .
1	artist all the time do remake of some of the classic . sometimes they take on song that shoe are too big to fill so to speak . but in this instance chris brown did it justice and then some .
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording , which is often far from modern convention . i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of . the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical . maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux . quite far from heifetz , milstein and younger violinist . if you like more objective style , this is not the best option . stay with szeryng or milstein .
1	all time great song by a great country singer . great to play at 50th wedding anniversary .
1	love this version of tu amor mi amor by formula five . use to listen when growing . my mom love the song , good time .
1	getting a new album from robin feel like a gift from god . every song on here is wonderful- one hauntingly beautiful song after another . i already had do not cry alone and bought a cd from germany to get mother of love , but had never before heard any of the others . what a treat for every robin gibb and bee gee fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous song ! i can not stop listening to this album , especially anniversary and sanctuary !
1	i am sure that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest , but this one doe the trick for me . i have been more than a casual fan since he appeared on fernwood tonight and sang the piano ha been drinking . tom version of jersey girl ( the original ) can not be beat . the heart of saturday night ? nothing really need to be said . if you want to try tom wait on for size , starting here is not a bad idea . great stuff .
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch . i would seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he would written the song for him . it wa kind , and touching , and the song itself wa great . look for another year at massey hall , i am !
1	i bought this album because i like the god bless the child track . i have been a fan of joe augustine for several year . will buy more .
1	i remember when the four top were popular and i still love them today . soon my oldie favorite list will be at 150 !
0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything . it is a dreadful recording and the vocal on 2nd chapter are down right ear piercing , not in a good way . i remember being so much better , then again we all thought early christian rock/folk music wa delightful .
0	the absolutely worst song ever made . if you like screaming through the whole song , then you will love it . me , i like some melody and rhythm and not a bunch of woooo aaaaaa eeeeaaaaaaa .
1	enjoying listening to mark chesnutt on cassette especially bubba shot the jukebox , since that is what i call my new nissan juke , my jukebox . i wa ruining my cd so i have been playing cassesttes while i wash and wax my jukebox .
1	we listen to many cd for 1-3 year old . this is the favorite she always request . in fact , this is our second copy . we try others and she dance and sings to them but request her old favorite when painting or dancing .
0	i really get sad when i hear this new rap crap on top of the greatest band ever . i used to go see these guy when nobody even knew who they were . maybe show of 50 or 75 people . that wa the good ol day . god do i miss the house man !
1	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record them . some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the mat . others are not so great , but they may grow on me . ( but not that one about bird . ) i am just happy paul is digging out some gem and recording them in an inspired way . if it take romance to make that happen , so much the better .
0	i like to pick out 3 song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program . i can not find 1 here . just when i think i like what i am hearing they find a way to blow the deal . almost every song is overplayed . talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road . recalculating ! weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd . they can surely play but need some serious direction . will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid .
1	i like these guy , they kind of blur the line between pop and rock but somehow still come off a being heavy . they just kind of have a nice old-school feel good rock vibe .
1	passion is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music . i have been a fan of george skaroulis ever since i stumbled upon him at a greek festival some year back . if you love great relaxing piano music along the line of george winston or jim brickman , you are in for a real treat . i have never been disappointed in this artist offering . listen to the track and find out for yourself , what you have been missing . and then get passion !
0	the 2014 remaster is terrible . like so much music remastered these day for mp3 player , it is completely oversaturated , so that the sound is compressed and distorted , and there is almost no dynamic range . the sound file look like a brick . this type of remaster is what give digital sound a bad name and make people long for vinyl . it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster , but this is not one of them . boo !
1	cripple creek by harvey reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance . keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing .
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar & electronics work . i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style . so far i have had only moderate success . hybrid fart ( that name should have been my first clue , if we are even talking about a bekker cd ) everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant ( not really the language of love , is it ? ) or perhaps not so wordy . for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake .
0	so i know there are two dirty word in the song and i wanted the clean version ( that you hear on the radio ) so i could listen to it even if my child pop into the room . but instead of using another word like the radio edit . this one us cartoon effect . very weird and just a you are getting into the song that pop up . wish i wouldnt have bought this one .
1	found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my mexican vacation folder on my personal website . it fit the bill perfectly a it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that doe not overwhelm the web browsing experience , but wa a delightful addition instead . i have since listened to some more from this artist , and liked most of them , but this particular song is my favorite .
1	it is hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard . there are so many worthy candidate . big star radio city get mentioned a lot . t.rexs electric warrior come to mind . but the frontrunner from the 90 ha got to be mezzanine , a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant . destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison .
1	very good quality , price & delivery , well done !
0	most likely not the song you remember . check the preview first .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
1	wy i like all the cd because she wa the best of the best a a wife and a mother .
0	this cd is heavy duty sad . if you are a heroin addict , this cd may cheer you up . i only liked one song on the cd and i am a lucinda fan . this is not a feel-good cd .
0	probably the worst excuse i have heard for a musical . no actual music or story and the lyric are just juvenile at best . doe not give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art .
0	this is a poor recording of a great performance . i thought my stereo amplifier wa damaged when i heard the periodic crackling noise while playing the peer gynt suite 1 and 2. but no , i can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise ( but not a pronounced ) when playing the same track on my laptop pc using my bose headphone . this cd might be passable if you just listen to music on an ipod or phone . however , if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo , do not waste your money on this rubbish .
1	another great song by matthew west ! this song can reach so many people , because everyone ha felt regret and despair .
1	this song is one of those song that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self .
1	for lover of david arkenstone and others on the windham hill label , this album is a keeper . very relaxing and peaceful , while not putting you to sleep . i love to work late at night and this music is great for that .
1	have you ever felt like your day wa dragging ? those day when you are upset for no reason at all ? how about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you are just not feeling the appropriate motivation . i have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above affliction is listen to eye of the tiger . this song will cure any mental ailment . they you should have it pumping through the street of alaska during the dark part of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west , their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney , i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice . only one for kanye wa absolutely awful , and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian . rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney , four five second is absolutely very low for both of them .
1	another stellar album from the awesome jenny ! beautiful and finely crafter all the way through !
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
0	this song is pretty slow , i think . i do not know why i did not like it . i just did not like it very much .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
1	love this cd . a great mix of fun and serious ballad .
1	i needed to refresh myself on the lyric . i sang this song at a best friend wedding in the 1970s . then at his son , and now for the daughter . crazy thing is , when i wa younger , john denver wa a good friend . i miss him still .
1	big third day fan and this did not disappoint !
0	where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyric go ? while the music may have at least attempted to go back to from here to infirmary it is stopped dead by skibas voice and lyric , such a on draculina and the american scream . his raw passionate word have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocal and now song just seem awkward when he decides to throw the f word into them ( eating me alive ) . dan manages to save some of the album with off the map and fine , but once again , they lyric are sub par .
1	the song is catchy and fun . amy winehouse wa a very talented singer and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song .
0	i enjoyed it more when i wa a 16 year old hippie . audio quality wa good . i forgot the rant about god though and that wa enough for me to delete it .
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre , but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk . it is even above that silent night one that wa re-covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone ! i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior through song .
1	1. waltz for j.d . 9:57 . 2. pretty bossa 8:40 . 3 . 6/8 thing 9:07 . 4. blue and green 8:36 . 5. this is new 6:06 . 6. fit for a prince 7:00 . 7. alphabet city 7:56 . 8. the loop 5:48 . 9. she is leaving home 10:02. john bishop , drum . jon davis , piano . paul gabrielson , bass . steve hill , drum . produced by paul gabrielson .
0	a disappointment compared to other beegie adair performance . i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it .
0	okay , this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or 21 at 33. but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album , this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road , honky chateau , rock of the westies , etc . many of the song on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej song ( just like belgium , chloe , the title track ) . but sadly the song fall a bit short . my advice ? skip this one and purchase jump up , which is not a great album , but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his 70 form .
1	the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing . my daughter wa devastated when i told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live . and this song- it wa both our favorite cranberry song . the song haunted my dream the night she passed . my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang . she wa obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her song , and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound .
1	nice product . would recommend this seller .
1	nice song - i am not a big fan of old school country but this one not bad . a couple time in the song the lead vocal is a bit wobbly but she recovers well .
0	this album is 1 star because most of the song are unlistenable . i do not enjoy listening to this album . i do not recommend this album . addy .
0	the tape will not play . it drag . ive tried other tape in the same player and have no problem .
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
0	sound quality is poor - probably original . it would be better if the track had been remastered . at least you get to hear the way the music sounded by the original band at the time they were produced .
0	not what i wa looking for- i wanted a reading of the sanskrit , the word for word definition and the translation . the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature , so the 3 star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking . also , i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires . the sanskrit mantra , when they are present and accurately read , are music enough .
0	and i say that so loosely . this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar-coated fluff . i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance , but this one grate on my nerve . first . copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do ! not original and we had enough of that song . that is what this song totally ride on ! at least chris brown , even though it is a similar beat , ha something going for his song , with you ( better lyric , nice video ) .
0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of year ago . delayed a my review may be it is sincere . i am a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one of the best band of the bosstown rock scene . i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track . i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris record .
1	i love this cd . barbra is amazing !
0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism , the animal third album , the first beeing the animal and the second animal track , i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job i have heard so far . the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track .
1	brilliant ! i have not seen the show ( hope to , some day ) but the music alone is phenomenonal !
0	this is his worse album every . the lyric suck and his beat suck . he claim to be the best but he is not . the worse song are theee forth of the disk . he should have took time and dud this disk right
0	occasional ( just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off ) popping noise and brief second where there is no sound occasionally . only found this with his recording and i have not tried them all . wish i could return this purchase a i will not be listening again . : /
0	a a fan of tso . we were looking forward to this new 2 cd set with great anticipation . when it arrived , we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed . although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso , this concept left u very cool . there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise . we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste , but i must say this one wa a bust .
1	much better than i had hoped for ; the basic reason i purchased two additional cd of joes . can not go wrong here !
0	i could not download this . i tried multiple time and reading all of the help info did not help ! very disappointed
0	hall & oates a interpreted by a 1977 casio wristwatch and a screech owl . this is the best of the first quarter of 2010 ? no star ! ( well , i guess i have to give this crap one star to get outa here . ) why only 1 blue album ?
1	one of my favorite contemporary christian artist . the song and lyric stir my spirit and uplift my soul . i always feel rejuvenated and inspired after listening .
0	most of these are only portion of the song , such a 1 verse and the chorus . i would prefer the entire song . also , many are done with a country feel to them , not the traditional music you would hear in church . i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with , and it is not a hit . wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i-tunes wa 3 time the price .
1	simply put . yes . very relaxing . encouraging . motivating . hope instilling . inspiring . reminds you of good thing . encouraging you to remember the creator promise
0	the sound quality is poor . youtube ha a version by beecham and the royal philharmonic with much better quality .
1	chris tomlin never disappoints , his worshipful heart is evident in this album . his music touch every generation , my grandchild , my child and i , all find something to like in burning light .
0	all the song started sounding the same le than half way through . sad , because we really liked him on the show .
1	i am not sure a i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiast , but herere my thought . in the trend of cd re-releases of classic gospel amazing grace , the complete recording offer more than one take on many tune . and that is a good thing ! the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again . and since these are live recording , the spirit move and move . i love aretha , especially here . her voice and spirit soar and we are taken with them .
1	wishbone ash ha always been a favorite of mine and these recording are exceptional in quality
1	i like this song , i love that usher gave a sweet undertone to a dance type song . i like just about everything from guetta .
1	a perfect guide for a lasting relationship . instruction on how to make a marriage be happy for 75 year and more .
0	uninspired garbage . such a disappointment . i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out . i could not be more unhappy . uninspired is the best way to describe it . it seems so half-assed when compared to their previous album .
0	yes , this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden . steve may be the main composer in maiden , but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself . he doe need the other 5 guy . also , it dissapoints that harris got this singer , richard taylor , for the album . the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle .
0	so . now you do not pay to download an actual file , you pay to listen to one song at a time in yet another music playing app ? i already pay for spotify , i only wanted an mp3 to make into a ringtone . this is 100 % useless to me .
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you . i would definately recommend this to anyone ( even if they are not a big fan of classical music ) .
0	unfortunately this album doe not contain all of the shanty which is a shame , since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the military and these are very similar to our cadence . since this album doe not contain all of them , here is the youtube video with 35 of the 36 shanty . [ . ]
0	loved his songwriting his voice real strong excellent country music highly recommend this alum have recently bought two more album of his from amz
1	beautiful . great acoustic . great ballad
0	this digital copy seemed to be poor quality . i purchased it after listening to it a a billion time on on you tube and it just doe not sound the same . excellent song , but i will continue to use the the youtube version .
1	this item exceeded expectation ! bought a a gift for a family member for enjoyment and daily use . recommend this item .
0	according to frontman/songwriter ra mcguire , the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well-deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp . this wa after the label had voiced it approval , including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit . tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper . lawsuit were filed , friendship were scuttled , and , most significantly , they went with a different producer ( howard steele of heart fame ) .
0	i do not have the download . help guideline not working , the cancel button wa hit immediately but account still charged , please credit my account
1	these remixes are slammin ! you will dance and laugh outloud . warning ! this stuff is explicit . headphone at work , and in public , are reccommended . jonny mcgovern is genious . the remix of do not fall in love with a homo took his already riotous , totally barry white inspired , slow jam and made it a dance club classic . check it out . you must .
1	the best song were from the 80 and this is no exception . i heard this before the whole how i met your mother hype and it ha always been a fun song to jam along to , especially in the car .
1	all of phyllis hymans song made me cry . even this one . beautifully sung . www.k-mille.net
0	i remember liking this song when it wa popular 5 yr ago . really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era ( and since ) . am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune ? she flat out every few bar , she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average . overall kind of meh .
0	it is a good song but nicky minaj is featured . i do not like the way she sings
0	pay atttention . from a mix tape and doe not have the whole song ( pointless )
1	love it , love it , and really really love it ! yeah a 40 something year old like ke $ ha - part of me is embarrassed , and part of me is psyched ! ke $ ha is awesome !
0	it is a sound track for the movie not the movie should be listed a the song from the movie zero dark thirty . but if they did that no one would buy it . frank bole
0	rip off , not the song it claim to be . it is someone speaking in another language .
1	this cd is hilarious , i admit there are some song that are not really funny , but there always 1 or 2 bad song on an album ( in this one , the 1 bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song ) . also if you are easily offended by swearing , raciest remark ( do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny ) so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this . but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
1	i thought this wa annoying at first-and it is . but it is much le annoying than most kid cd . it stand up to repeated play .
0	this ha to be a joke . next he will duet with william hung . at least the profit go to charity . still just donate to charity and keep this garbage away from your ear .
0	far too cloying . the original fleetwood mac version wa sweet without being cloying and is far , far superior . unfortunately , that version is not available a a legal mp3 download . i am left with the option of buying the cd of bare tree for this song .
0	i got this because it supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility . many of the example or story drag on waaaaaay to long .
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd . i have always liked dj shadow , and wa interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now ( in 2016 ) . it is typical shadow ambiance and found sound , but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like . a few track attempt a dubstep feel , but it come across a plodding . a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern .
1	just about everything this man writes is better than the last .
0	i downloaded the amazon player and everything and it will not play . waste of my 0.89 ! i will stick with itunes from now on .
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback . robin thicke , pharrell and t.i . definitly hit the nail on the head with one . it reminded me of something you would hear from earth , wind and fire . i hope these three collaborate again .
0	disc 2 of this digital audiobook is damaged . i tried downloading it a couple time , but it always skip repeatedly after about 23 minute into that disc . this is the equivalent of selling a new paper book with missing/ripped page . unacceptable .
0	i am not normally a fan of remixes , and in this case there is no exception . if you have not bought the original onerepublic album ( dreaming out loud ) that ha this song on it , you are missing out . i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started , but there is no reason for taking credit for someone el song . i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out . i much prefer the original mix to this version .
1	wont go wrong , and enjoyed every second of eric claptons music . other downloaded mp3 music lacked clarity . you will not regret getting/purchasing these music .
1	great album with a list of quality song .
1	this is spontaneously inspired piano music that evokes wonderful memory and stir up the dreamer in the listener ! the whole project , fingerpaintings : serenity is like peace on a disc !
0	this album wa a huge letdown . it is way too melodic and popish / commercial light rock . being a huge fan of all that remains , owning all of their other album & having gone to their show , this album wa a major disappointment . melodic can be cool if it is still heavy like on their older album but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me . i do not like the direction they have gone in . i liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it wa dissatisfactory .
1	i have this song at the head of my classic rock playlist . mr. grey had a great voice , this song ha a happy/upbeat tempo and it serf a a kinda thank you for all the song that follow : give me the beat boy ! just writing this review i need to listen to this again .
1	i absolutely love this album . i play it constantly . these song are just perfect .
1	great song , heard him sing it on american idol and had to have it , i like the acoustic version just a well a the other .
1	i bought this uk edition of their debut album because it had extra track including boyfriend featuring snoop dogg ! i liked it !
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such little imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the music world history . . and that they do it so very badly . band like the people , touch , white witch , armageddon , ( and the list go on and on ) were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds . and yet , modern band continue to take those name for themseles , then release inferior , common , boring music , and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the name of others .
1	for what it is , it is a great tune sung by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic . brilliant !
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him . if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song for you !
1	an enjoyable mix of cuisine , cultural mix and personal transformation . loved it !
1	fantastic ! possibly his best album yet
0	compared to taylor swift cd , this really suck !
1	i absolutely love this song which manages to be both depressing in a strangely end of the world kind of way and keep you interested
0	only a soulless piece of trash would support a band that justifies and support rape of a helpless innocent woman . and for good measure , their music suck !
0	i wa very disappointed in the speed sleep product . it seemed to go on and on . the music wa very annoying . once you buy it you are stuck with it . it is nothing more than a relaxation session . just relax your body , think calm thought , and save your money .
1	i love barbra streisand . the duet are great . another gift from my daughter for christmas .
1	i found this worship cd in a store randomly . it ha some of the best praise and worship song ever . i can not help but get up and praise my god when i hear these song . what a blessing !
1	still a dynamic and sexy song from an amazing artist ,
1	use to deliver morning newspaper listening to this on tape .
0	if you are looking for something to help you sleep , this is not it . the 30 second preview here sound peaceful ( and almost hypnotic to me ) but the full version ha some strange element . a the other reviewer said , it doe have a lot of static . it sound like . popping noise , or something to that effect . very strange .
1	love casting crown . their song always speak to my heart . always uplifting . one of their best song yet . like to hear more
0	i am not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set . but ddamn , ss13 ? really ? pretty sad omission here . new slayer fan : start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog . this is a waste .
0	it sound like she wa making it up a she went along .
1	excellent ! excellent ! excellent ! this is heaven . though l do not speak the lang the voice move me spiritually . i have been replaying the song since l bought it . doe he have other hymns/gospel in the same lang ? not english please . thank you for the heavenly song !
1	excellent work of art . she is on target with every song . seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative , bad girl image . some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question , this is a top quality production .
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
0	i went on ringtones for android , listened to i walk the line and bought it . problem is it wasnt a ringtone , but the whole song .
0	not a relaxing music a i though it would be .
0	am sorry i purchased the cd . music is slow a drag . not the usual upbeat christmas music .
1	nate dogg took p-funk and funk to a whole new level with his smooth blue jazz vocal yes sir no musician man can sing like nate dogg or even come close or near or even simaler
1	this is a great cd . i saw gloria bill in concert in cadiz , ky back in october . i bought their cd and could not stop listening to it . always sometimes is one of my favorite song now . oh yeah , and the sister of the lead singer work at sonic here in cadiz . funny , huh ? mmmmmmm . cheeseburger .
0	beyond stupid . even more stupid and irritating than actually having 2 phone
0	not really chistmas-y , just 12 1/2 minute of repetitive and tedious listening . thankfully , it wa free , otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad . i love metallica and wa excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock . however , you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record . my old record have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old , but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level . it is like the speaker wa blown , very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music .
1	the cd got to pr in no time , it wa in great condition and it wa overall perfect since i love manson and his new album
1	excellent service and product . very satisfied .
1	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a great catchy rhythm . you may have heard it is cover in pitch perfect .
1	this second single from the new album rise ( releasing june 25 ) is more of a power ballad . john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song , but it is still a good song with a great message , of letting love cut through the noise of our culture . if you are familiar with skillet , think along the line of lucy ( although american noise is not a story song ) . if you are not familiar with the band , just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80 rock band .
1	although gretchen is a self-proclaimed redneck woman , this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production . the christmas song for example , is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase . i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song . it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original . santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight .
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past 30 year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album . like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy . these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist ( robert lamm , terry kath , and peter cetera ) however , a most fan know , the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty .
0	when i gave this album 3 star at one time ? ! after listening to az , then listening to this , a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch , this album is a bad a it get . first off this guy bite off everything in his site ! the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die , just longer . the only reason why he is famus is because he got shot 9 time , and he is a fool on stereroids . he is all over the medium , and is an annoyment on mtv and bet !
1	i bought four of these . two for myself , just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates . i have a vast sinatra collection . this is one of the top 5 disc . the others being only the lonely , swinging lover , september of my year and the live at the sand .being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot . being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed . it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find .
0	destined to appear on worst ever list for decade . knock william shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever . dylan wa always a horrid singer , but we forgave him because he wa a brilliant poet . here he mutilates the exhausted warhorse we have all come to despise . you simply can not believe your ear .
0	this is an original artist remake . if you want the original version of this song click here > & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/one-more-try/dp/b002sz2z80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > one more try < /a >
0	this chick is ridiculous , she sound like a britney spear on crack . there is absolutely no talent on this bitch .
1	i stumbled upon lp searching for vinyl record on youtube and nearly fell over when i started listening . she is absolutely incredible and ha affected me more than any artist in year !
1	i love the arrangement on this collection . many of my favorite easter song with stirring instrumentation . a good collection to have .
1	this is some great playing here . the tone and rhythm are perfect . this is excellent to study along with the actual 32 etude . i am giving it a 4 star because i do not like how he interprets some of the music . i know this music is difficult and there are many way to interpret it . however , some part just have to sound right
0	i had pre-oredered this album on itunes , and could not wait to get it . i first fell in love with bright eye when i heard their album i am wide awake , it is morning . the gentle , yet strong instrument and focus on vocal had a large calming effect on me , which is why i grew to love bright eye . however , this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered . most of the song rely heavily on electric instrument and a distorted sound that come off a angry instead of thought provoking .
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe , this song is not only catchy , but powerful and sang really well . i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over . excited for the full album !
0	if it were not so badly warped it would be fantastic . maybe if you are lucky and get another batch . . .
1	great song , great copy , sound great . i will be downloading a lot more song from amazon very soon . loved it !
1	this is a beautiful album inside and out . from the moment the package arrives- it is such a beauty to behold- the packaging immediately take you on a journey and then you put the album on and it is such an awesome experience . transporting , timeless , exciting , meditative , beautiful , just so many quality wrapped up into a wonderful musical experience . so much to enjoy & to go back to and re discover
0	i downloded this song to listen to new music , but it is not my preference . it is a very experimental music for my preference .
0	because the song cut where the explicit word would go . i wish i could get a refund , i ended up buying the explicit version instead
1	thank you belinda for recording this song ! it is fun upbeat and showcase belindas vocal talent . just downloaded yesterday and have listened to the song about 20 time . make you feel good and it is so wonderful to have belinda put out another great pop hit ! a+
0	i have bought music through amazon preferring them to itunes because because itunes try to control their music too much . however after the latest mp3 purchase , i find it now amazon ha made it a difficult a possible to download their music to my itunes . bye-bye amazon . i guess i am gon na have to go back to the itunes store a much a i hate to .
0	saw them perform on a talk show and thought i might like them . oh well .
1	i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio station coming out of chicago . when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which a far a im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the price it is offered . i have no regret about this purchase .
1	i love this song . anything featuring david byrne is going to be brilliant , never heard of this band/group before .
0	i bought this for my 8 month old and she is not impressed by it at all . she much rather listens to the radio . guess i could have saved the money
0	do not . it doe not have vocal track in the mix . it is a straight-up repeating beat . when i previewed it , i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample . after all , it list all of the rapper in the artist column . wrong . wrong . i just spent a buck on half of this song . thanks a ton , whomever came up with this idea .
0	song were different from what i heard on youtube
1	nice album , easy to listen to , and obviously a hit for ms. morissette . would not doubt that because of the sound , lyric and time this album wa released , itll easily be noted a a
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
0	i like other song by her better , this song is okay , but she ha done a lot better on her other song .
0	actually , to say , i do not like it is not totally accurate . it is more than just tolerable , but i guess i wa expecting something more than i got .
1	shinedown being shinedown at their best ! similar yet very different from all their other offering ! keep it up gentleman !
1	the legend is back ! best bluegrass ever ! doyle lawson & quicksilver know how bluegrass must be performed ! this album make fun of more from these group .
0	the song is great the mp3 stink amazon ha it tagged so you have to use their player to get it to work . it is not a stand alone mp3 . i do not think i will be buying anymore mp3s from amazon .
0	i can not imagine why i would order this . my wife must have done this . the song is trite . the lyric are predictable . if you love mope rock , this song is for you !
1	emmylous voice is a good a it get here , and i wa amazed at the synergy between her and rodney . these duet could not be better . this album is stellar .
0	i have not listened to it due to technical problem .
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want .
1	recording quality is not that great .
0	warped upon arrival and water mark all over . doe not play correctly and unable to return . do not recommend .
0	for one , it wa the short verision or radio version . also , they gave the impression that it wa un-edited but it wa , not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar . i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content .
1	i love these techno version . dj doomsday , please make more of these song . god bless you . now i can dance and worship at the same time .
1	this is one of my all time favorite song . even if you are not a country music fan i would recommend this song . well worth the price of the mp3 .
1	wonderful cd ! one of brandis best . highlight are the eye and wherever is your heart
0	not that bad of a tribute cd , but a for myself , i would really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp . the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album . if you are a major , and i do mean major floyd nut , you may get more out of this cd than i did . the track the great gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy , the woman vocalist just go on and on . to put it another way , the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band .
0	this song wither did not load on the player correctly or is only weekday the sample is . either way , i am not pleased with it at alp
1	excellent to listen and relax or utilize for meditation into the salvation of christ for u all . help you with your time speaking to god one on one . perfect for catholic or any other follower of jesus .
1	it is a very happy song that you can not help but put on a great big smile to while you listen .
0	i downloaded this mp3 after hearing it in an at & t commercial . i like the song , but the mp3 sound absolutely awful . it is just way too compressed . so it is extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range . almost unlistenable . i honestly do not think you can blame a lot of this on the mp3 encoding . 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate , and i have plenty of mp3s that sound fine with lesser bit rate .
1	the sound is rich , the harmony are deep , the arrangement are original . i have played it many time and recommended it to friend .
0	disappointed , but never with much hope . it is a shame .
1	two icon making great music together .
0	did not like the way it wa sung . fortunately it wa free because i certainly would not choose to buy it .
1	1. i need your lovin 4.24 2. drummer beat 5.20 3. let u turn it up 4.49 4. just feel it 5.19 5. y.e.a.h . 5.09 6. licensed operator 6.24 7. tease me 6.14 8. mind , body and soul 5.22 9. come back 2 me 4.42 10. aint no miss 5.02 11. sundress 6.11 12. i never knew 6.12
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes , and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own . railroad earth ( 6 piece new-grass jamband ) provides great support giving all these song ( 8 out of 13 which are haynes original ) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel ( like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail ) . i enjoyed the whole of disc1 even though haynes song writing itself is only so-so , and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc 2 are not bad , although none of them seem essential .
0	what the others say is true . i bought this cd back in the early ninety . i soon discovered it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp . no stereo and one song play faster than it should . i have the original mercury stereo lp ( all track were stereo except one ) . just an fyi , the stereo lp version of please do not talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version . you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube . search for diane ray stereo .
1	i lost my cd of the manhattan so i picked up my hit here . great love song .
1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over , then you know you have got a good album . eisleys unique sound is so soothing , refreshing , and at the same time slightly rockin . i would say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard , with girl vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine . like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper . and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony .
0	maroon 5 ha joined the like of all the other modern day group . what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike . this may be fine for today youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value , but for u old classic rock people , i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice .
1	i do notknow why , but i love this song .
1	i play this to help rock my baby to sleep and she must find it so calming because it work every time : )
1	this album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with a pop edge to it . with a very high level of musicianship , dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acoustic folky song . amazing songwriting musically and lyrically !
0	first of all , let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day , i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the 80 stuff . in fact , chicago 16 is one of my favorite album by the band . and 17 is an album that they have every right to be very proud of . and while 18 and 19 were just cranking-out-the-formula album for them at that point , they at least had some huge hit single , which wa really all the band wa about at that point .
1	this is absolutely beautiful - especially by harp music .
0	i am a big fan of terry hall and the colourfields fantastic first album , virgin & philistine , but with personnel change and a different vibe , this album pale in comparison . terry voice is still great but he go in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion , which is still one of my favorite from the mid-80s .
0	some is a bit catchy , but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle . sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her . lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out . high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to .
1	what an awesome collection of relevant artist on this cd . something fresh to hear and my favorite , bruno mar is featured on one of the track . if you do not want to buy it to support the producer & artist by making the purchase at least take a few minute to listen to the sample . i am guessing you will want to download some of the track to add to your personal collection . many of them are that good .
0	did not purchase this book either or whatever it is - did not purchase this one . can not rate it . sorry .
1	this song of epic proportion broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew . it instilled in my heart such wonder that i can not even write in word how wonderfully wonderful it truly is . gangnam style not only fill your entire soul ( yes the entire soul ) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying , everythings alright . that tone form in the back of my mind every time i hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul .
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse . they have really grown together a a band . the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album , but they have not lost the depth . jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life , rather than dwelling on the past . the vocal are also much more powerful ; jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing .
1	leann rime is one of my favorite artist to begin with . no dislike , loved everything about this song . recommended to anyone who need rapture .
1	this song is a sure thing for when you need a pick me up !
0	they chopped the song off ! the original song is 4:30. the edited song , which appears here , wa chopped off at around 3:33. huge disappointment . and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing .
1	i love this song because it reminds me of the movie kill bill . i even use it a a ringtone for my phone .
1	such a great tune and could listen to it all day . blake clean version is just a good . make all redneck proud .
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage . i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it . sound like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40. i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first 3 album .
1	an excellent series with a theme that really capture the feel of the series . definately recommend especially to lover of the series
0	there is only one song on this cd worth listening to . i recoment getting the mp3 version of tarzan boy and ignore the rest of the song .
0	this album is trash , this band completely copy and try to be gun n rose of the 1985-1989 era with the leather , boot and aviator . the lead singer of faster pussy in one video try to be axl in jungle with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelet and leather pant . dont buy this imposter junk , go get appetite for destruction by gnr and rock out . no one can ever be axl . the song try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [ being bad ] . also the lyric try to be like brett michael of poison and [ are awful ] .
1	great quality . super fast download !
0	i wa very excited for this album to come out . i have been a fan of river and the =w= since childhood . i am only on my first day of listening , but am in shock at the quality . big hype over this album and all it is is random , jammy song put into an album . plus i have heard half of these song in the past with the same quality or better . not too impressed . but i will always purchase weezer related album for support , but after the green album , make believe , and now this .
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase . the song were not the kind i enjoy . i believe it sold by jakes name .
0	i must have ordered this by mistake because i do not remember it . wa i supposed to download it or what ? i would like my money back please
1	great mid-tempo song . make me smile . great for workout , long drive , etc . brings you up . would like more of the same .
1	the good morning song is what i bought this for , but love the cd a well . the good morning song can take a drabby day and put pep in your step , brighten your face a you sing along & dance with her . thank you mandisa for blessing u with your god given talent !
0	could not get it to play . tried on every player i could find .
1	love ryan adam . and now i love taylor swift . i bought both cd !
0	her voice is not the problem but the arrangement is boring with harsh repetive line . i would like to hear her sing this song with the help of a different backup band , arranger and composer .
0	my favrit josh groban ever . i play it every few day . wish he would do more showtunes and le opera
0	so sad , so big boring and overproduced compared to the first two . who said coldplay 2.0 ? no , wait , i sometimes like coldplay .
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album , isaac seems to have lost his touch , or his will to create masterpiece .
1	great remix of one of the key song of the show give a great feeling to a strong show number
1	i love this album ! it is my new favorite .
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song . the rest is , well , all filler . and the record is only half an hour long , so there are only about another five complete song ( track one is a reminder of maiden ` s number of the beast and track three is 50 second long ) . it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well . piece of advice , tape or download the single and spend your money on something else .
0	although a nice album musically , these mp3 track i downloaded were of poor quality , probably recorded from an old vinyl record . all track had click and pop , while some had actual hiss and skip ! i know there are better quality album out there because i have one of them .
1	love this music . voice are amazing . beautiful in every way . loved it from the very first time i heatd it .
1	first of all we have to clear one thing up . 0304 mean 2003-2004 this is her music for those year . although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you . another thing many people have said that jewel ha sold out . i understand their point of view . if you are a die-hard jewel fan and do not like dance , pop , or very upbeat music then this cd is not for you . i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a well .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
0	i did not want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase .
1	great cd and great series . i own all of them . steve boalt
1	great album for the linkin park fan .
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind & fire . this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone - young and old - get up a move .
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the 70 and 80 . while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big band incarnation , woody brought a pretty decent band along a well , even though he wa entering the last decade of his life . amazing guy , amazing version of la fiesta . starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time ( were they all rolands ? ) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody , there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle : shrieking trumpet , a nifty tiberi solo , and awesome dynamic .
0	01-06- making memory of us.mp3 could not be imported . the selected file is not valid or is corrupted this is my error message so the file is no good to me . .
1	not really a fan of the artist but i do like this song . great to listen to when i am at the gym for motivation .
1	this is one of those perfect single it is so simple but , so close to flawless dave gahan vocal even the 1980s synth keyboard sound all work to create a flawless single that still to this day stand the test of time ! a must all around 10/10
1	a wonderful story about a man trying to help a heartbroken girl he meet in a bar and try to start a conversation with
0	i am a vocal man , so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music , why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean , during my era of music it wa pretty simple . journey . lovin , touchin , squeezin , pretty simple huh . def leppard . pour some sugar on me , no college class to figure out what any of those song were about !
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
0	j. walsh said what i thought about this album . huey lewis and the news were a great pop-rock , new wave sounding band , they did more blue in the past , now they are trying their take on soul . this is not the huey lewis and the news we all love . huey please try to do another rock album before retiring , i think you can still do it .
0	a vile song from a vile album that glorifies adultery and a family destroyed . leanns action during and after her affair ha cost her many fans-me being one of them .
1	this song is musically beautiful , and the lyric seem to speak to me far too often . cyndi laupers voice is expressive and this song is so touching .
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now . i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current . i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well . closer without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track . illumination is without question the worst . there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr. groban . his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day .
0	downloaded it but it ha the same defect a the 30 year old cd track .
1	lovely cd , calming and relaxing music .
0	there is a reason this recording is dirt cheap - it is a live recording with somebody coughing all through it . you would think they would have chosen a better performance to try to sell .
0	the song that i wanted is cut off and doe not end correctly . it stop in the middle of a phrase . i could not use it .
1	help is another great album recorded by the beatles . few other artist had their rate of consistency . song like help , the night before , ticket to ride , and tell me what you see are true true rock song . act naturally is almost country . you have got to hide your love away , it is only love and i have just seen a face are very much like folk song . yesterday and i need you are classic ballad . no le essential than any of the other beatles album . buy it .
1	country continues to turn out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach . adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song , which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier who lost their life in various war . this is a poignant and important recording , and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric .
1	i love this album . favorite include anthem , run , outlaw , scared , chasing twister , and my whole life long . after it all make me weep with joy . if you have never seen them live , do not miss the chance . anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand take , few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live .
0	6 star for the song , zero star for amazon help ( or lack of : ) in locating it on my computer . what can i say ? i like this tune a lot . buying it here wasnt that smart because i still have not found it on my computer and amazon help could not help me find it . shrug ? i ended up getting it from another website so it doenst really matter i guess .
1	one of the best sweet romantic song of all-time i think , true love wait and true love never grows old or give up and grows sweeter over time
0	i am not a fan of the vocal being redone . i liked the original much more . listen before you buy !
0	where is the woodwind obbligato ? the break strain ? and what is with the stinger ? ! this is not the real go u !
1	this is awesome ! i pop this cd in around thanksgiving and it basically play until january ! josh did an outstanding job . i love his version of the classic christmas song , especially little drummer boy . every track is great , in my opinion , however i am not to keen on the first noel . mainly because i am not a fan of faith hill voice and i am not convinced that their voice harmonize well together . again , that is just my opinion . i would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone .
0	it skipped many time . i wa given a full refund .
0	this is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performance ever recorded . the cracking noise make it almost unlistenable , completely unworthy of the quality of gmos fine session . you can hear the crackle in the preview - yes , it is that bad and worse all the way through . i am surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy ; sound like it wa made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment . this recording of the same performance is much cleaner : http : / www .
0	what is it with this guy ? will he ever have the gut to release another album without a greatest hit package tagged onto this new material . this guy for 10 year ha re-released the same old music ! the one time he did not with a $ 70 million budget , invincible only sold 2 million copy in the usa . even though his $ 70 million budget wa directed to only marketing in the usa . why doe not everyone go to cnet.com , go to the downloads section & get yourself a free mp3 cd ripper !
1	it more than met my expectation . barbra did it again .
1	i use to play this over & over again when i wa in college . i so loved this song .
0	this wa a single cd and if i would have known that i would have not ever purchased it . thanks
1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured in film . i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my day .
0	i did not appreciate his bit about joining isi .
1	diana krall is a real cool chick on this number .
1	i love this song and on top of it all it wa super easy to download and to listen on any device .
1	i love this song and group ! it brings back memory of my youth . thanks for having this song for me to purchase .
1	i heard this on kjzz , my favorite for jazz music , and liked it well enough to get the mp3 version .
0	well , having listened to this c.d. , i am sorry to say this album is pure crap ! yes , i am a die hard beatles fan , but i can not figure why anybody would like this recording . the instrument sound cheap , the drummer is woeful and the sound in part sound thin . i admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer , but part of this are unlistenable . i heard my mate copy and would not even bother to buy it myself . very poor album .
0	this artist leaf a lot to be desired . i actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind . but i found myself not being able to get past the first thirty second . it is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly pass for music today . save your money or get it on bootleg . personally i would not take this for free . add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thief , cop killer , drug addict and ex con .
1	saw him on agt , and loved his version of this song . had to buy it ! will hopefully get some other song .
0	what can i say ? it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album . apparently , there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here . what complete jibberish . how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release ? while i would love to say i am shocked mr .
1	great song and i am an 80 metalhead . that is saying something .
1	if you are an adopted child who feel that empty space in your heart or someone who want to understand then listen to this song .
1	i recently went on a tour of hearst castle in central california . there is a grand dining room where invited hollywood celebrity and others dined in the 1930s - 1950s . our tour guide told u that he liked tumbling tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song , tumbling tumbleweed , over and over ! -
1	after watching the movie secretariat this had to be a part of my playlist .
1	great song ! i have always liked crow , so that is no surprise . you would think ! but believe me , i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k-pax . it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year . the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely . the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man , a classic . unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack .
0	on 12.29 , i am waiting out in the colorado cold until about 2 am to see if i could get jim heath ( the reverend horton heat ) signature on a poster . first , he said , do you have a pen ? i said i did , and pulled out a blue sharpie . he next said , is it blue ? i said it wa . he proceeded to tell me he doe not do blue pen , and boarded his luxury motorhome . please do not support jim heath . jimbo and scott churilla signed the poster without hesitation , and are good guy .
1	i like this album it is great . i am 10 year old and i love this album . all of the beat are really great and the lyric are really great and 50 cent is a really good rappper and i just love this cd cause it is so good . this is what rap music is all about , really good beat and really good lyric and really good rapping . 50 cent is the best rapper ever , i listen to this cd every day after school while i am eating my snack pack and watching sister sister on the wb .
0	i buy the song but they never let me download it into my computer
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year , where her voice ha lost it luster , and she really ha not stopped for herself . musically , she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song . her latest song , diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course . i really did not find the song to deliver , a some of her earlier song had . i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice .
0	while i love the cd , it would not play on our cd player for some reason . i tried it on my son player and it worked . the reason i wanted it wa so we could go to sleep listening to it . maybe it wa a problem with how it wa pressed ? i do not know . disappointed ! : (
1	another solid release ! this cd fit in well with the rest of the music ty ha put out over the year .
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent , but the cd no longer will play , only played it twice , now no longer work ! i guess you get what you pay for applies here !
1	i purchased this cd for my wife during christmas . she love jackie evancho and since she ha been playing it , i have also become a fan . miss evancho pose an incredible voice .
0	i do not know what she is saying . the only reason i assume is because i do know the song silent night . now how do i delete it ?
1	i love this album . god bless you , derek horton , wherever you are .
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut ! this is a bluesy , brassy ala david rose stripper sounding , slow paced arrangement . some of you will like it . i am biased , however . the original use string for the main line ( this us brass ) and brass for the aside or counterpoint . it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent . this aint that cut ! for those who relish soundtrack music this , to me , is like the hugo montenegro version ( arrangement ) of the man from uncle theme .
1	one of the most overlooked album in it is respective genre in the last 10 year
0	this is a waste of money i got a cd with no book and no talk on cd they sell something new now which is the same old thing with new cover very disappointing sorry ed sueta
0	it is terrible when fm radio play out a song that wa average to begin with . it make it even more lackluster to the discerning listener
1	i love this song . it is exactly the same a what i had heard from the dvd . great quality sound . i stored the sound in my amazon cloud .
1	the first time i heard this song , it wa during a time where i wa sad almost every day . thing were not looking good for me . but the song , the lyric spoke to me and helped me to cheer up . very inspirational for me .
1	a beautiful song , a hymn of earlier day , and who better to do it than fernando ortega ? the one-star review really should not be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose , but rather an accident on someone part . this song deserves 5 star .
1	i have listened to this album probably 5 time since this morning . i have been a long time volbeat fan . these guy bring it all to the table with this album . trust me . get it ! now !
1	honestly , i wa never a huge fan of this song , the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me , but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song , one of his favorite , he think it is really romantic etc . . . . not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day . i have always known the lyric were romantic , but they have more meaning for me now .
1	both song featured on this one were very good . the instrumental version were nice addition a well . the last track is a talk segment , which is why this is 4 star .
1	the song is great . i have been listening to it for year . it is just what i expected . that is the reason i bought it . i have been buying song from amazon since they started selling them . i am going to copy this and paste it to every song that i review . i hope you do the same .
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed . the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl . that might be true , but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with . there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song . not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album . they all are a mediocre at best rating . nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of .
0	i do not see what everyone see in this dude . this album suck his beat are only appealing because of sampling . lyric are straight garbage a usual people wake up look behind poppy beat and mainstream appeal ! u wan na hear some real hiphop look for dude like elzhi and reks .
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
1	saw the video for this song back when mtv wa mtv . loved the funky vibe , make you want to put on a hat and dance on a theater stage ( it doe for me ! ) . : - )
1	ramsey lewis ha been a favorite of mine for a long time . if you like jazz buy this track and sit back and enjoy
0	listening to this cd , all the way through , wa neither easy nor enjoyable . if you like beat-driven pop with repetitious lyrical hook , you might like 0304. if you are expecting to be touched by another excellent jewel collection , prepare to have your heart broken . this cd truly disappointed everyone i know who ha heard it . it is pure pop drivel .
0	lee morgan , quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road , and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year . when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling . the brilliance of his tone is there , but his idea have not yet been fully developed . plus , cliff jordan playing , the senior side man on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to .
0	showed item to artist and wa told it wa fake . checked artist copy and it is completely different
0	great version of this tune . this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason . however , it is fuzzy sounding , and doe not quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 second . i will try to get a refund . it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credit of the movie . the visuals add more than you can know .
1	well , memory , ha a special place in the heart of my sweetheart , and betty buckley simply doe it best !
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen . i wa pleasantly surprised . from the first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming some of the tune . i could not wait to play it again .
0	i am a huge manowar fan since 1982. i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm . i have seen the band live probably 12 time both in the u and in europe , and have met them personally on occasion . it pain me to say it but this album is horrid . yes , the production is poor but that is not the main problem . the song themselves would not have made any of teh previous album . ( i liked god of war ) . this is the first manowar album i have heard ( and i have heard them all - many time ) that lay totally flat , sound bad , and doe not have a single song that i find worthy .
0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album . bluntly speaking , it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time , or waisters and melted on the blunted cd . if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single , then stop searching for this cd right now . this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already . if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul .
0	while the package art is nice , i think that is about the best part of this disc . the best song are at the end of the disc , and the new vocalist is o.k. , but not a jon anderson . most of the song on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous . i have listened to this about a dozen time , thinking it would grow on me , but i just do not enjoy it .
0	music is great-it will not download to my phone ! ?
1	who rock harder than nickelback ? i downloaded this song because i listen to it weekly when wwe come on . so now i use it a a ringtone for my android phone .
1	this concept and music/dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever ! the music is phenominal ( who would have expected le ? ) and the live/acoustic and cd/dvd package is an off the chart idea . in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver , hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way !
0	i have down loaded this two time . the song doe not work on my computer . i have had similar situation with down loading music from amazon . they have refunded my money sometimes . but-why doe ten song down load & this one doe not !
1	i like this song a i know it wa meant for his father tug mcgraw . it is a great song and tim doe a good job singing it but i am not a fan of tims .
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord ! this cd is astoundingly well-crafted , every note seems perfectly placed , the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music . generally , this is soft , warm , lulling music , but it doe not put you to sleep . toxic girl is catchy , jangly , and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced . sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it . there is a real soothing quality here , though , that can not be denied .
1	for most of u who are familiar with bob baldwin body of work , the latest release - all in a day work , is simply brilliant . the opening song - a new york minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic baldwin . if you have bobbaldwin.com , try playing funkin for jamaica and then can you feel it , from the latest release . both are vocalized by tonni smith . for anyone in doubt , please - you are invited to go back and give brazil chill another listen .
1	could not believe there were no 5 star review . this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many . love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder . had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play , it wa so nice to find on cd . also bought a copy for my daughter , who also love it
0	a big disappointment . purchased based on the high praise it received in a recent aarp magazine publication .
1	great song ! i cry every time i hear it .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that .
1	a good song you don t hear everyday . a great song for those who are in love for the first time !
0	i did not order this item and it appeared on my computer one day . some may like it , but i did not . thanks .
1	you are the one is an award winning song and just to get that song is worth the price of the album .
1	almost a good a liza . my 2nd favorite dance version of this song . or at least upbeat tempo . highly recommend ,
0	uggg , another christmas cd from leann rime . you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice . it is sad to watch all her project fail and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album . people put out christmas music when their career are failing . leann used to have a great voice and wa a likable talent . not anymore . i can not understand the word she is singing and the album is not very good .
0	i would rather donate my money to a corrupt charity [ . ] . reason why 50 cent is the best ! 1. i can relate to his lyric in da club and pimp 2. he on the radio and mtv all day ! ( which mean he talented ) 3. he ha talent ! because he doesnt play any instrument .
1	my 6 year old grandaughter had the volume up for hour while she played the cd . she will be listening to it for a long time . grammpa
1	i am sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i bought it for , but alan jackson just doe an exceptional job with it .
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever , however , this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty . the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90 would have have submitted to company a a demo . i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies , but with this album i fail to see that expansion , and if anything , the feel appears to be reflecting the mood , not neccessairly the word , of the so-called economic recovery of the united state .
1	i purchased the presale album . two song are available immediately . i think this may be their best album yet !
1	excellent album by christopher cross . i bought extra copy for friend .
0	thought the song would pick up but it doe not - we were looking for something a little more dramatic but it is kind of bland .
1	i love her music . it contemporary gospel and this song just touched my heart the first time i heard it on the radio . worth the purchase .
1	it is awesome ! so glad a cd came out .
0	i wa very excited to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i , m the biggest fun . once the cd arrived i put it on and i wa extremely disappointed . very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth . i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin .
0	mac milliers getting lazy with his writing . hip hop is more then just refurring to every woman a a b * or a ho and making million and that is all this guy think it is about . it get redundant real fast .
0	i noticed seventy seven people also did not order this and it showed up in their order . not a way to promote a band .
0	i did not realize that zappa had more than one recorded version of peach en regalia . the version on hot rat merit 5 star . this version left me greatly dissapointed .
0	but this album is horrible , only one fairly decent song on the entire cd.do not buy it you are wasting your hard earn money on this .
1	lin-manual miranda is an outstanding composer ! he is a remarkable man making history on the stage with history a his inspiration and a musical form that allows much information in the shortest time !
0	it did not work like i thought it would to guide u a we accended to the top of pike peak . we had trouble downloading this item .
0	sound wa terrible . could not here actor speak because music is too loud
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing . back in 2003 when jewel did , it wa a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u wa also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality .
0	i bought this version before i saw that the u.s. navy band had also recorded the irish national anthem . the navy band version , in my opinion , is much better . more upbeat .
0	i have a vynil copy of that album , and will not buy the cd , cause there are much better option to waste money ! zipper is a strange album of an artist that wa a great star during the early-mid 70 , but during the disco and the new wave , turned to be irrelevant . his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experience to make a come-back , but he had to wait few more year . zipper reminds u sometimes the classic alice of love it to death , school out etc .
0	completely different than any of her older album . if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit , this is not the album for you .
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song , not bing crosby . it is still a good verison , it is just not bing crosby .
1	i have seen it written that great art divide , and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs . for me , this is something decidedly different for the band , yet unmistakably dream theater . the shift in focus from shredding to melody , long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing . while it certainly a 5 star effort from the band , for my taste it a little samey .
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers , back when she first released this album . i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story , evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop . sure , the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented- but , if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book , it is the detail that really count ! when it came to the music , i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book .
1	i love this song because it is really catchy and fun and ha cute lyric . david archuleta win again . : )
0	this product did not download properly . a a result i had to download a second time - incurring a second charge ! i wa robbed !
1	beautiful music . perfect for the holiday season !
0	got for a friend to hear kid sound creepy
0	pre ordered it and when the album wa released i only got 4 song in stead of all of them on the album release date
0	i love dt & i respect them for taking a chance but this album doe not work for me . i suspect that i would enjoy it more if i give it more time but i am just not interested in investing the time right now .
1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
0	her music is horrible and she support , endorses , and sleep with lilo brancato , a cop killer . if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective , daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society .
1	my mom love this cd . i made her day .
1	love this song . it is truly magic ! my fave coldplay song in a while . looking forward to the rest of the album .
0	acck ! michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw . run and hide ! it sound like . sorta like weird whistling . if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o.k album . i rated it 1 star because there wa no -200 star . : ( . all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible . i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad . if you are wondering , this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent .
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon . i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean . can not get in to this pop deluxe stuff . some of the rave review puzzle me . this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it . not trying to say jewel should stay confined but , just because record sale are lagging a bit , doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above ?
0	ordered the wrong one but i listened it it too late to return for an exchange
0	i love terrance and his acting is superb . he just can not sing but he can really play the guitar . i paid 13.00 for the cd and there were only 2 song i played a little . i enjoyed the spanish type song . maybe if he wa able to sing more soulful . anyway do not pay the cd , but i love you terrance you are one of my fav actor .
1	this song is very special to me a i am a proud navy wife . any song that honor the military is great . this song wa played at the funeral of a very special navy seal . it always brings tear to my eye .
1	when two super talent like keith urban and miranda lambert get together , it is bound to be a hit and this one certainly is ! i would rate this among the great duet in country music . highly recommended !
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect . it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good . a 101 string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus . preview it and judge for yourself .
0	the mp # version ha a nasty skip in voldomiro - the first track !
1	i love this song . it fit the movie .
0	the trail hear did not sound like a mix- i do not like downloading any mixes- i like original music- these were all for my prom birthday party in november . still will play the tune but not what i originally wanted .
1	this downloaded to amazon cloud player and i had to install the app . i do not want the app . i wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my ipad . if i am listening to music on my ipad i will not be able to listen to this song without switching to the amazon app . that would b a pain . i thought this wa going to download to my ipad with all my other music . i have not looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over . i honestly do not think u can .
0	this review is about the quality of the vinyl , not the quality of the music . my copy of this album skipped several time , most notably on the song deck dark . always in the exact same spot . a this is unacceptable , i had to send it back .
0	please update it to the new national anthem that libya ha now . a after the liberating libya from qaddafi this anthem ha changed
0	a great slow song . i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school . i think it came out immediately after if i ever . i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine ! not too long after , i became a freshman in college . music ha always been a great companion of mine . their unison are great . harmony a+ . their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song . it is a classic . they remind me of the guy from the platter , i think that is my grandparent generation .
0	sum 41 ha no talent . they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible . if you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre , try new found glory , the ataris , or maybe older blink-182 material . this album is made for stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason . it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there . do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band .
1	i would heard this song for a while on the radio and decided to purchase it . the price wa right so i bought it .
1	nice to be able to download an old single song that trigger old memory instead of buying an entire album .
1	this came out in the 80 and wa a record of rerecordings of their hit . it is for completists like me . i think the new version are great ! but there is no cd for this one . i wish they would put out the rest of their early stuff . but this one will do if you want the band doing great version of their song . with mark l too .
0	started out very slow , just could not feel it !
1	the title explains the song . it inspires a person to keep going and that they have value . keep it on !
1	old school music . the best from puerto rico . isla del encanto . bonita perla bonito san juan buenos recuerdos del pasado
1	good 1st lp . each song is good and it is quite enjoyable .
1	brandi is one of my all time favorite artist and this album doe not disappoint . i definitely recommend it to anyone who love great music .
1	this cd will have you moving to beat . all of the song are great and the production is top quality !
0	while the arrangement of this cover get 5 star , this performance of it get 1 ( it would get 0 if that were an option ) . if you want to hear the original cover , which wa done while giving proper credit where it wa due , check out jonathan coulton ! also , purchase the one that is in the style of glee so that the purchase go to a good cause . < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/baby-got-back-in-the-style-of-glee/dp/b00b6lrx34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music ! except that it is cut at the end . tragic end for such a fine piece of music . this music is on a par with heilig , by schubert , sung by the choir of trinity college , cambridge . these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb . however , this one is ruined by being cut short at the end , before the music is finished .
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song .
0	would not let me play the song exception # 184 .
0	i wanted the song so bad that i also ordered the re-mix but did not know that it wa the album . i don ; t have a turntable to play it on . i have no use for it .
0	i am so disgusted with amazon this season . 1/3 of the christmas are offensive , explicit , and revolting , and it is not even a week into december . i saw that it wa lady gaga , so i wa wary at first , but i decided to give the preview a chance . light me up and put me on top ? really amazon , really ? christmas spirit includes carol , wintery atmosphere , giving , etc . not sexual innuendo . so disappointing , esp . after the first great song by casting crown .
1	dancing music from flo rida . ha song lyric right round taken from an older song . so if you liek the older song , this one ha a modern twist , hip hop .
1	this is one of the better collection out there . some very hard to find song on this wonderful 3 cd set . come in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these day . most multi-cd set case are flimsy and fall apart quickly . not this one . this is a bargain . it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd .
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure [ to the mass ] songwriter . turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one . and come on , taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest ? who advised you ?
0	barefootin wa on there , which is not the song we were after . we wanted let go baby , which wa supposed to the b side , but instead it wa mountain of love by harold something or another . it came from a series of collectible .
1	beautiful , meaningful song ! god speaks through this song and encourages those who listen .
0	sum 41 ha always been a band i looked down upon , their cd chuck really anti-impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would like it , and this album is very similar in that aspect . the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually . at least close to punk . but besides that nothing really appeal to me , rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk .
1	musical perfection from the foo fighter a usual .
1	great cd . this is the only cd i have found with so many great song on one disc . usually there are a couple good hit along with average or below average hit . from start to finish this cd will have you saying i have forgotten how great that song is . definitely recommend to any 70 music fan .
1	this song is amazing . it explains how he refuse to live a life that is not holy and acceptable by god . this song is one of those who minister to both the saved and unsaved .
0	i thought my having just downed a hard cider wa making me hear this song in some distorted way , but after reading everyones review , i now see it is not me on a buzz . this song is just horrible . it is off-key , the vocalist can not carry a tune in a bucket , and is that the sound of cat fighting in the background ? a frank barone from everybody love raymond used to say , hooooly crap . thank god it is free and i could hit cancel on the download .
0	i so much wanted to love this album ; dylan a sinatra . he must really believe that he doe not sound bad , but it wa painful to listen to the off key croaking . i love dylan and i have been a fan of frank for a long time . the longing and emotion were somewhat evident , but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much . i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i can drive along the ocean with my window open .
0	the problem with getting the preview is that they never let you hear the end of song . i do not know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album , but several of the song have the last note or two cut off , either completely or right in the middle of a note . not a lot of joy there . i will say that there are some song on the album that are fine , but getting slammed like that really ruin everything . i will probably go through the album again and remove these song from my device .
1	i absolutely love this song . back in the day when i wa a little girl , i would hear my grandparent playing the song because it would come on the radio which now make me feel old but i am only 38. i love older song and this is one of many that emmylou harris wrote that is still popular to this day .
1	we all listen to different music ( classical , country , heavy metal , blue , rap , pop , folk . ) so it is rare when we like the same band . this is the band . this is album is wonderful . not a stinker in the lot = )
1	one of his best and one of the best holy night version ever done !
0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl album we have . not so . this is a 3 cd set and load of track but many of them are kind of jazz style , strange slow singing and empty feeling . there were a few pleasant traditional piece , but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there . if you want to experiment it might be worth the money , but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this .
0	it is just a preference . it is not my cup of tea that is all . too heavy going for young child i think .
1	it is pretty good . had it playing outside the front door halloween night . good mood maker .
1	my daughter love carrie underwood and ha all of her cd .
0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time , and one of my favorite artist a well . so , i wa so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song . but , i wa horribly disappointed when i heard this song . i really expected better from her than this ! in the past , i would have bought a shania cd without bothering to preview it first because i knew that it would be really good , if not excellent . when shania finally release her next cd , i will definitely preview it first , and if it is a bad a today is your day , i may not even bother buying it .
0	i paid for the song because i wanted the mp3 . after i paid for it , it will only let me listen to it through amazon . that doe me no good . i want the mp3 that i paid for .
1	took his course up at the conference center . amazing ! changed my life . increased my biblical understanding by 1000 % ! you simply can not go wrong with this . and dan ha been teaching this method to student of all type , culture , country , and language for generation . it work , and you will understand it . all material , not a lot of added unnecessary b.s . ( sorry ) . in other word the focus is the lesson , not dan ! if i could buy it for you , i would .
0	hurt my head . i am too old for this at 50 ! for sure .
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep . i have yet to find that version for sale . this is not a good substitute in my opinion .
1	my son came to me one day with tear in his eye playing this song on his phone . he said he only had one request of me , dad , promise me that if i should pas before you that you will play song at my funeral . well what could i say but , only if you will do the same for me son . very touching day for u . thanks guy .
1	i have listened to this over and over and love it every time . it is a wonderful song , especially for easter . thanks
1	anything that patti labelle sings can not be bad ! i loved this song when she and michael mcdonald first recorded it , on separate coast , and i still love it ! wonderful album ! maryg
1	love this album . one of his best . if you like this one you will love & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/self-made/dp/b0014567mk/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > self made < /a > from his homie mike jones
0	ok relaxation music - but it just doe not do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
1	i wa suprised that this song wa good . i wasnt expecting much from an american idol person , but this song proved me wrong . hopefully the rest of his music is a good a this song
0	heard this on a movie and really dug the lyric . have not really listened to it since i downloaded it . the intro wa too long for me , and i do not like the vocal they are shaky like there is hardly any talent . once i heard the whole song the lyric are not a impressive a when i heard it on the movie .
1	guy ! i wa so excited when i heard thalia wa going to have a new cd , and that excitement wa really worth it when i bought and listened to this cd ! all the song are just amazing ! thalia ha grown a an artist from album to album . all i can say is that i recommend this cd to everyone , it fantastic !
1	i would ask people to purchase beyonce if they like this artist . music is an individual choice and should be treated a such .
1	always love josh groban . in perfect condition !
0	do not download just this song , you only get the tail end when they are singing the do do du dupe part .
0	why do you make me so happy and also want to to die on the same album ?
0	nickelback essentially sum up everything that is wrong with the music industry today . what else can i say ? this stuff is so bad it make me go cross-eyed .
1	one of the best compilation ; a great way to meet and learn about yes . when most people think of rock music , the general conception is that of boisterous , noisy , unruly dope . then group like yes , pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication . these tune are not only enjoyable , they also nurture one synphonic appreciation . thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock , which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece .
1	i heard this gentleman sing on huckabee one night and i loved his voice . i immediately went to amazon to find the song and get it .
0	i think this song is worse than perfect stranger . i am pretty disappointed in this band . i think i am gon na stick to listening to music that i already know or band that are more popular .
0	i bought this album and accidentally had it playing in a snapchat i sent to my friend , next day i got sued .
1	cabaret still shine well after decade . in her day , nobody could deliver like liza and cabaret illustrates why . you have to hear it again to understand .
0	horrible . do not buy it . i would rather suck puke through a straw . this is the worst song i have ever heard . yuk .
0	love waylon , but this wa a little bit of a dissappointment .
1	i will start off by saying that i am one of those completist type . i have to own everything by maybe a certain band , or person . i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes ! , a well a at least 8 other band . i own everything he is done , and i have to admit , this particular album get the most play . you will know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame . he did yikes ! right after coachwhip , and it show . it is extremely thick , reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it is much slower .
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different picture of the eight doctor . they should have name it dr. who and daleks calendar . almost all the picture are from the peter crushing movie or comic book-like picture . there is only one of tom baker and one of john petwee . this calendar should be only for major dr. who and dalek fan .
0	the sound quality of this cd is awful . can not imagine what it would be like if it had not been remasterd .
0	. but this is a poorly produced cd . both the computer-enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solo , and the overuse of vibrato in the solo make this a definite disappointment .
0	t.c . elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge ( the album and the movie ) . his delivery wa excellent , so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut . unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark . the first single miss thang wa good . good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle ( anyone else remember cassette single ? ) the rest of the album wa mediocre . t.c . elli had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of true confession .
0	this cd wa bought by mistake by me , doh ! so you know , this is a different guy . i guess if you like cheesy r & b/rap lite , it is ok. could not get through the 2nd song myself- sure he look different , but thought it wa early & a bad pic , haha- oh well . buy both of the real sean rowe cd or lp , they are killer !
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
1	pretty good album . love the option to download and get cd for almost the same price
0	love cyndi lauper but it suck big time that my ipad 1 can not use this prime music which i am paying for
1	i love folk acoustic guitar music and have listend to many artist . came across this song by robin bullock quite by accident on youtube . wa completely blown away . listened to it about 10 time before i could walk away from my computer . wish robin lived in the u so that i could have more chance of seeing him in concert .
0	not what i expected . it is kind of dreary and depressing . i love iris but not this one .
1	once again , micheal castaldo ha brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of prayr . micheals rich , soulful voice always touch the heart and soul of the listener , and prayr is no exception . this song , done in both italian and english , prof once again , that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language . micheals interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and i truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves .
0	clicked on this too quickly before noticing it is not the original .
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule . whatever happened to good old-fashioned church music ? i am serious . this type of music , known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet . i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano . nirvana wa not a good band . the lead yeller committed suicide , which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan .
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship .
1	this song is the reason that we , in the u , know who adele is . great lyric , great music , great adele .
1	this album is definitely worth buying ! wonderful song from start to finish , no skipping necessary . amanda shire fiddling skill , creative lyric , and sweet voice will have you listening to this album on repeat .
0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .
1	i do not care what religion she is ; the music is good , and i hope her publicity stunt really pay off . all those rich celebrity who are in the closet a conservative did not have the gut to do what she did yesterday ! she is a strong , independent , fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrity to just come out already !
1	i have given a few copy of the cd and guide to family and friend because it brings one closer to the blessed mother and in touch with the lord . i listen to it driving , working out or when i feel i need to quiet myself . susan ha really done a great job with this and it is worth the purchase .
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out . i bought it . and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song ( for a total of 18 ) on this version . i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed . i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out . the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy . the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly .
0	zorro is ok - the rest is quirky but poor .
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
1	i really wish they would do more cover . this turned into an amazing project for their fan . thank you shinedown !
0	first of all i admire and respect alvin and am sorrowed at his passing . this album wa not one of his best . the guitar work is weak and the song are very disjointed .
0	disappointing ; very much mor type music . not what i had hoped for , sadly .
0	i never purchased it , it piggy backed on another order and claim i wanted it . besides that it awful . whiny voice , cheesy boring and silly . sound like typical office people trying to get in touch with emotion and make amoving song lol .
1	i have also been waiting for this cd for about 3 year now , and now that it is finally out . the anticipation is deffinatly worth it . i love this cd , it is just a amazing a i had expected . it is awsome . it is good no matter what type of music you usually listen to . it is a combinaiton or hip hop , and metal . it is an awsome combination . it is funny , adn serious . so nomatter wht your mood is you will enjoy it . i think that this cd ha just made my month .
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 a a member of brogian bard and independent solo artist and have never heard something that i did not like and usually loved marc gunn is talented in many different hat such a podcaster for celtic music in many different format listen to him again and again a he always make you feel ultimately good even his death song album . his take and twist on scifi and parody are among the best
1	i decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare . he is an interesting person with a unique , soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint . this ha been one of the best album that i have ever purchased to date . every song is different but exceptional too , especially hand are clever . hummingbird us a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus , whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activity .
0	nothing new here , except the packaging . this collection is the first time inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album that is why god made the radio . the reason i highlight single is because , what the heck is a single these day ? although there wa actually a 45 rpm 7 vinyl single issued of that is why god made the radio , it wa just issued only for , probably , collector like me . the other new single , is not it time , only exists on the album .
1	man i wore this cd out when i wa a kid . and the music is timeless . best compelation i ever had and i got it with a burrito . you do not get any better than that .
0	offensive and should not be a part of the free christmas line up . what were you thinking amazon ?
1	alanis morissette ha a beautiful voice . i had to download it and listen to it often . i really love this song !
0	not a good listening song for the holiday . voice is too rough .
1	david broza is an amazing talent . loved seeing him live and wa thrilled to purchase this cd .
0	i tried to purchase this song on the amazon app for blackberry but instead of getting this one song the app tried to get me to download the whole album . now i am trying to figure out how to get a refund . love the song but the technology could be better .
0	i wa really hoping for that sound they make . loved other album of theirs . but this one is different . it good . but i do not care for it . it wa a great buy .
0	blase and uninspired , sadly , a wa most of his music from this album .
1	the cd arrived on time and in good condition . the music is loud clear and good recording quality ! i will be ordering more dick jonas music !
0	having the lp were did the dvd come from ? being a crazy fan of the fox and it is mighty wurlitzer i bought the ( 3 ) album and have transfered them to cd . went to the last two midnight concert were there wasnt standing room in the building . seating about 4000+ now sf ha a world class organ sitting in a wearhouse covered with dust awaiting to be reinstaled in the civic building and not being done because the city father can not get off their tail and get it done .
0	not a fan . skip this song each time .
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly . vocal are smooth and hypnotic . overall a great album .
0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album . i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work i would been seeing on her video . it just wasnt there for me . i will still play it but it will not be one of my favorite . my advice would be get a new producer .
0	poor quality mixing . poor quality sound . save your $ ! look elsewhere .
1	for me , all but one song made for a very good cd . their voice are growing in depth and enrichment . it is different music from their first cd some , like my father , who loved their first cd ( because it wa all of the italian favorite = and he is italian ) did not like this second album at all . my husband and i liked it very much !
0	while , at 99 cent , the collection is quite cheap and feature some fine performance , buyer should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly : it is drastically ( and clumsily cut ) . we get the soprano recitative there were shepherd abiding in the field , but not the marvelous aria that follows . and his yoke is easy , his burden is light , along with he shall feed his flock is also missing .
1	just another one of those snappy tune that make me want to move . i love this tune and hope you will try it out .
1	no one play this song any better than conductor and violinist . andre rieu . i first saw him on public television and wa so appreciative of his playing and conduting style . he truly ha feeling in each note he play on his violin . i know you will enjoy his music !
0	i am sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great band like killswitch engage , in flame , a i lay dying , lamb of god , ect . now thats real music . not this crap . the only reason this guy even popular is because he got shot nine time . in a few year rap will die just like disco . then metal will rule the world once again .
1	i listen to the mp3s for enjoyment but also for training purpose on the guitar . so it go without saying that quality is paramount .
0	i purchased this by accident . i do not like her music which is too explicit . i can not say i hate it , because that would put me on the fence with love/hate .
1	older style music , which i like better .
0	this probably is not the recording of this much praised song that you want - go to the album i want to see the bright light tonight and try the song there first . i think i mis-bought this version first and could not understand why it wa so often mentioned a among richard and lindas best . just saying .
0	my own throat feel strained listening to mr. dylan struggle through this genre . it is not for him . the sweet backup singer just do not help , and almost seem comical a counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this rebel-icon . if i were a little kid , i would run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen . actually , i may do that myself .
0	i do not know what this album is going to sound like for katy perry ! , but i know for sure i am not going to hear the rest of katy ! quit writing song about split and divorce with russell brand ! get on with life and write some better tune . roar and walking on air is definitely keeper ! if you do not improve i will not buy one more thing from you ! sorry sweetheart ! lady gaga # 1 ! so there ! slut !
0	this is b , the purpous of digital music is to choose what song you want and not forced to buy an entire album .
1	thank you , maurice white , for sharing your great talent with the world . you will live on through this incredible tune .
1	another solid song from the new skillet album that showcase their softer side . while this is not nearly the side if skillet i often listen to , it is good enough in it own right . rating : 4
1	i listen to this cd every day . all day . i absolutely love this group . i get inspired and motivated . feel good music by a family-group that can really sing !
1	good quality sound and it wa the original . enjoyed listening to this - took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio .
0	i have been a fan of buffy and james marsters for year , but wa not thrilled with this at all . the music wa boring and not a exciting a his brief singing spot on buffy . i would pas on this one .
1	1968 wa a year filled with social unrest , and the music in this hour-long cd reflects that . from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection , born to be wild by steppenwolf , to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation , on through the mournful abraham , martin , and john by dion , this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest , and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr. but even in the uneasy social climate of 1968 , respite wa found in music .
1	why do not we see this chick on tv ? i have heard her only occasionally on the radio , and her rendition are so smooth and sentimental . so well-done that she should be way on top !
1	this is a great 1957 session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson . a fine clollection of bebop & ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant + eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum . from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha-cha , this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat . once again , great & rare music like this is only available a an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith : eighteen classic albums-which i purchased for about $ 20 .
1	love slipknot new album , i am a huge fan aka maggot , highly recommend to all the maggot out there
1	this album is dope . wasnt really a fan of j. cole until his last album , this album will have me purchasing all of his album from now on . excellent lyric , production is outstanding . definitely one of the year best hip hop release .
1	i just love it . the music is will done .
0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe . but this just wasnt up to her usual . it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger , le universal audience . it also felt like she had forced the new song - they did not flow . and the male vocal did not mix with her voice . disappointing .
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack . the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time . however , a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound , the music here is strong throughout the cd ( and the movie ) . in addition to the main theme , the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite . it is pretty simple : if you are a big fan of the movie , you will highly enjoy this sound track .
0	this song wa purchased my mistake by my son . i have never really been into it . i have to learn to lock my phone . lol
1	jonathan sprout performed at my school when i wa six , and my mother bought me a cassette tape of on the radio . i listened to that tape until it finally broke after year and year of rewinding and replaying , so i wa delighted to come across the digital version of this album on amazon .
0	condition wa stated acceptable . hardly listenable .
1	i have worn it out , also gave a gift to family .
0	i received the album and it looked great except for the dint in the sleeve and when i opened it it had a dint in the record !
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band ( the only original holdover at this point ) , i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos . that said , like the predecessor set ( 1969s never going back to georgia ) , anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970s gulf coast bound on their turntable . working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld , these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album .
0	advertised a the explicit , non edited version and it is not , it is the radio version . waste of $ 0.99 . i need more word .
1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time . this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz , post-bop and avant-garde . by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60 and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world . barry altschul is superb a well and yes , anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway .
1	the used cd came from library-by the-lake , and wa exactly a discribed . it wa in perfect condition and arrived quickly , without damage . the life action singer produce great music and this cd is one of their best .
1	i first heard this on pandora so i quickly looked it up on amazon and purchased it . this is a great acoustic version of iron bar by stephen marley !
1	this is actually a great song . i am truly a died hard fan for k. michelle so i do not mind keeping it real . it is about time she is singing something that is a make up record . she ha always recorded break-up record and album , and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new . she is crazy , sometimes rude and take thing to the extreme , but one thing that is true is that she can sing ! support real music and trust she will deliver .
1	i have to say is that rick ross ha been thru the ups and down of ppl coming at him and dissing him well this album back every thing up rick ross is coming off real nice on this album . teflon don the album is more of an chilling laid back more kind of an album . song like free mason is really nice track over all the whole album is a worth of a pick pick up it better the drake album drake ha a good album to a well . maybach music 3 is i real nice track to check out to guy go get this album .
1	i love this song , waiting for more from oaktowns 3-5-7. this song pump me up everttime . let do it my friend
0	this is blasphemy , pure and simple . to degrade the precious holy scripture in this manner is to degrade our savior .
1	i had most of these number on two cassette tape , which eventually wore out , so i wa delighted to find they would been combined into one cd . the quality wa excellent and it wa like having an old friend who would moved away come back to the neighborhood !
1	best song of that year . waiting for the next one
1	this worship ( my season personally ) wa awesome .
1	it would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of jennis father geoff and an admired of her mother , maria . so . those question are answered . a for the cd and jenni on her own , this is a well thought out , highly listenable and original album . it ha been playing on my equipment for several year now , and wear well . enjoy .
0	never received it ! had previous review for other song but only noticed 17 at that time . now i see all these . just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comment apply : - ( - had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded !
1	even though the track promise that this is disco , it is really not . it is bright and shiny tech-house . if it is disco you want , ian pooleys hyperdisco remix brings in the appropriate bass riff . dave angel take his own remix funkier but no le shiny . wax doctor , not surprisingly , let the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze . still no disco , but that is fine .
1	got this song in my head after watching true detective on tv , so i had to buy it !
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this . this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her . this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a a toilet . molly jean wa 19 when this wa recorded . it wa produced by a member of the volebeats , which enticed me to buy it . it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch , occasionally flat , frequently sharp but only about 5 % of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note , even when she writes the song .
1	my dad really love these guy and he wa going crazy over this song so i decided to get it for him .
1	her voice is awesome . she could sing the worst song ever , and make it sound like silk !
0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now-wife laurie anderson . both are outstanding artist and musician . i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album . it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone . lou reed play electric guitar , laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone . the producer obviously told everybody to improvise . if you have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect .
1	yes , music is soothing and pleadsnt
1	perfect for reminiscing . affordable price esay download and i can carry this part of my past with me for whenever i need a blast from the past .
1	this is one of the best new band out there at the moment and this album and song are a must have !
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artist and album . i do not know how to account for that . it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like , unlike in time past . i received this album a a gift . this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music- soul , r & b , rock .
1	very happy with our purchase and delivery .
1	this is ep loosely based on love in different form . my favorite track on it is and then therell be a light . also feature crash , body , self-knowledge , dependence and corp d amour .
1	i love don meons music , but there are a few song that will not play . my favorite are i will say yes and the greatness of you
1	like most people , i only buy song i have already heard and liked , so . yeah , i think it is good .
0	i would not buy this album . there is a track missing and the new dubbs in the speaking part are terrible !
0	i received a discount on this product for my honest feedback . good item
1	this music reminds me of the early album of gary numan , mostly because of the instrumentation used . i like the science fiction theme and robby garner vocal . prodigy 7 ha become one of my favorite , and i really like control .
1	great worship this song is everything
1	a very soulful john anderson song . fantastic download . cloud is so nice for all my music . thanks amazon for providing such a great service and great selection of music .
0	bob dylan should know better - he no longer ha a voice . moral of the story - do not get old and think you can still sing . this also applies to harry nilson , paul mccartney , etc .
1	this music and the lyric really are enough to encourage you along the way . but the vocal are simply amazing and make it seem so easy . not everyone can do this .
1	lorraine feather is the complete package . here are incredible intelligence and uniqueness , beautiful voice , wide-ranging mood and arrangement . always surprising and satisfying . you must hear lorraine feather to believe it can be this good .
0	i never received my download it would never go to the music on my phone i want my money back bc i bought two copy of the song
1	ballet teacher and their student will love this song . basic dance vocabulary and movement are suggested along with tutu and tiara . a remarkable resource for ballet teacher .
1	we just got this for christmas and it is a wonderful cd ! my four year old is asking great question about the song .
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project , i have to admit , i wa excited to get my hand on this box set , from one of my fav . band . i could not even get through 12 song before i realized , what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is . david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd , to sell this garbage , and will probably do well with their past image . i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc .
0	only liked one song . let your hair down david make something fun and not boring . we hear the same old traditionals every year .
1	the whole album ( cd , mp3 , etc . ) is awesome . spend some jack , get a real bargain , enjoy the sound . ken ooltewah , tennessee
1	a beautiful song . i created a cd to use in my work a a massage therapist , and included this song . lovely !
1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past 30 year than dokken . even without george , without jeff , and a weakened ( and at time embarrassing ) don , this band is still one-of-a-kind . no matter the lineup , dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release . jon levin is incredible . never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george . the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay . levin is that good . the first and last 3 song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the 5 tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable .
0	mary poppins soundtrack wa the best purchase i have made so far . i bought it for my granddaughter birthday because she love mary poppins . she can sing all the song in the soundtrack and i love hearing her
0	i am not a big a fan of king los a i am of los . when he wa doing mixtapes before becoming king , he wa the truth . this album is a let down .
1	it is a fantastic mp3 that i can blast into my ear via my mp3 player=what is not to love ? i love how easy it is to purchase great sounding mp3s through amazon .
1	you will not be sorry , the song is enchanting- carefully moving from beginning to end , and taking u on a smooth ride through a sweet melody .
1	this is a great song to start off your friday . i listen to it on the way to the office every friday morning . set the day to be a positive experience no matter how your day end . great song .
0	not the best song she ha done ! you got ta love the ministry to really enjoy this song . maybe there is more to come !
1	group 1 crew is an amazing band , and this album doe not disappoint ! i bought it for my sister and she love it . came in excellent packaging and we are enjoying it very much .
1	his father is known a high caliber musician , and his son is confirming the line of great and amazing artistic work . great cd for music collection . r .
0	the first two were great and they will have shelf life . this wa rushed out for christmas & anyone that gave it more tan 2stars must be related . bad review like this cost u money & make the artist believe they did something right < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/iron-man-ultimate-two-disc-edition-bd-live-blu-ray/dp/b001gapc1k/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > iron man ( ultimate two-disc edition + bd live ) [ blu-ray < /a > ]
1	this is my pick if you need a song to get you started on a long road trip to fight vampire , demon and werewolf .
1	the history of this song is very intense if you listen to the lyric . also the singing voice are very well in tune .
1	i really love this song and enjoy having it on my computer and kindle . i like the idea of choosing the song i want and not having to purchase the entire album .
1	here is a frank sinatra single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago . ol blue eye recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his heyday at capitol record . released in january of 1957 the tune spent 19 week on the chart and peaked at # 15. the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo . this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it before .
1	found this mp3 download while browsing and remembered just how fabulous the door were . love this song and am really happy with the download !
1	i am not a parent ( but i play one on tv ? ; ) , but i used to be a nanny . my 2-3yr old twin obsessed over hi-5 , and i have to say , some of their tune were pretty darn catchy . i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more ( you know , the one that got stuck in * my * head all day long , that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself ? hah ) to make a collection cd out of them , this being one of those song ; i admit , i really did not mind ( too much ) having to listen to them every .
1	awesome brings back many memory of good time , i am a sucker for the oldie
0	on this cd you will only find side a of the original album skin diver suite , side b is not included . too bad . plus : it is taken from vinyl , not from the mastertape . i guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip .
0	it is totaly amazing that this wa created . what make sindel think that horrid classical march will sound better when played ( very badly , i might add ) on electric guitar . the tone he us are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window . this is totaly unlistenable garbage that ha no merrit whatsoever . this might well be the worst cd i have ever bought . i hope this will be the total extent of sindels musical offering . putrid !
0	there are many release of the world of nat king cole ( others with 27 to 52 song ) which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version . this is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar , you are better off skipping this one for one of the others .
1	love this song , so fun . my 9 and 10 year old love it too . we jam out to it in the van .
0	seth ! man , who broke your heart. ? your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety , and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time . but still , neither is enough to let me sit through 17 song of depression , loneliness , pining , cry . in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note . but your failed . unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river , i can not recommend this , not even a background dinner music .
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once . ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate , and his voice is nothing special . his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous . i would have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune . a waste of money .
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music - and i have not yet heard all of her 1990s-era release ( because they are a little difficult to find . ) but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s fall into the pop and light jazz genre , i get the impression that for hetero her manager ( or producer , whatever , ) wa trying to nudge her into alt-rock , that tane herself wa more interested in .
1	it is classic michael jackson ! how can you be anything le than thrilled at thriller ! it is just a great album at a great price ! it is time le and you can not go wrong with adding this little gem to your collection !
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd , then do not even bother with this album . not too long before this cd came out , trivium covered metallicas master of puppet . in all honesty , the song rock ! but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica . this new album is a complete letdown . trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy , and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is , frankly , depressing .
1	have always loved this song- more the music than the word . it seems to be the only one by gotye that i like though .
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic , garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice . the title track , some are lake , is the strongest with it narrative of lost young love . the band next album , cloak and cipher is even better .
0	this soundtrack left off the only song i enjoyed from the movie . i guess i should have read the song list
1	if you are reading this review , then you mustve been born recently , or stuck in some other time space continuum . i purchased this tape year ago when pete rock & c.l . smooth were new artist , and this song/album still bang now like it did then . i am just updating to digital .
1	my little boy will listen to this song over and over . great way for memorizing scripture .
1	beautifull rendition of this song . soul and feeling from this talented young lady . a bit slower than the original which showcase jena beautiful voice .
1	really love this song . it wa used in the movie trailer for the secret life of walter mitty and the song is pretty addictive to listen to .
0	i wa unable to download this mp3 without downloading software i do not want ( amazon music player ) . i already have a music player , and it work fine . i just wanted a favorite tie song .
0	not a expected . thought the music would be calming , but it ha so many short piece it wa not enjoyable for me .
0	not the best stuff from either artist
1	beautiful song ! worship worship worship ! amen .
0	i loved the song , but it did not download all the way . i can only listen to part of the song .
0	not even going to bother with this unless they are 320kb quality . why even bother with something low quality ? seriously .
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled banner
1	i love this song ! i can not get it out of my head ! guaranteed you will hear this all summer long !
1	well packaged and good response . great quality , thanks !
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me . west is another great group of song !
0	i never seen so many of her video ( like die young ) that ha nothing but anti-christ and illuminati symbolism in them . i thought lady ga ga and mondana wa bad . if you do not catch it then your being programmed .
1	love every aspect of this ! great film ! great soundtrack ! top notch stuff . if you have not seen or heard this , your missing out !
0	this album make me sick . it is generic and boring . same stupid drum beat in 90 % of the song . what happened ? way to go guy , you sound like s * . i am clearly upset . i could cry . mumford and son are dead . they should have changed their band name with this album . disgusted . this is sissy music horse s * .
0	it is a pretty song , with great vocal , but i am not sure about the lyrics/message . once i downloaded and listened to it in it is entirety i wa displeased- sound rather morbid to me . not a great choice for a christmas song . sure it ha a christmas-y sound , but if you really listen , it is not about anything to do with christmas . is it just me , or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far ? i really enjoyed this 25 day of free downloads advent-type calendar last year .
1	bought this for secret but am getting hooked on the rest . still a timely cd . came on time and in a bubble envelope . worth a purchase for sure .
0	this cd contains the censored version . when cash say the son of bitch you will hear beeeeep instead . what are we , 10 year old ? the at san quentin original version is uncensored . i am not sure what other version are uncensored , but definitely this one is . when this song is not censored , it is a 5-star song that put a smile on your face .
1	another one my mom got to enjoy for awhile before it wa passed back to me because mom and she ha now gone home herself yo heaven
0	i do not hate the music , i bought this piece because i loved it for year , and wanted to hear it reformatted . but the recording i purchased is somehow scrambled , like different track are playing out of order in some place . not what i remembered at all ! i hope amazon can fix it .
0	3 of the song on the cd are scratched : - (
0	the cd stalled halfway through the first song . not satisfied !
1	one of the top 10 christmas single ever .
1	might be my favorite radiohead album ever . the instrumentation is gorgeous . thom yorkes voice is at it best .
0	it did nothing for me , i lost not one pound .
0	million of american listen to music on their ipod . try telling that to this record label , which willfully made this cd incompatible with itunes . i do not mind buying music digitally , but i also like to keep a physical copy of the cd for my collection . copy protection doe not give you this option . i am absolutely enraged and i feel like screaming . avoid !
1	this is the best song the widespread panic ha ever released . i love it . no matter my mood this song always pick me right up .
1	just amazing after all these year . i have petitioned james taylor to put out a dvd of the current tour since they are not coming anywhere near southern california . but , these track are all wonderful and the accompanying dvd is a wonder and joy to behold . do not doubt it , if you like james taylor , get this one . hurry !
0	i could not get more than half way through really boring book . not only wa it boring but it jumped around in time between chapter . drove me crazy . begin 30 year ago then jump to present then back to 1822 to present back to 1822 back to present . the only thing keeping me going to the half way point wa waiting for something to happen . it never did so i gave up .
0	the cd wa just okay . i am from chicago and i love house music but this wa kinda lame . a lot of the song sound alike but the bass is booming ! i am a dancer and i can only use about 3 of the 12 track . i am glad it did not cost a lot .
1	tennessee-born chester burton atkins ( 6/20/24 - 6/30/01 ) wa co-creator with owen bradley of the nashville sound . he produced record for elvis , the everly brother and so many others , but chets true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing . this pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen grammys and wa instrumentalist of the year nine time . he is a member of the rock and roll , country music and musician hall of fame . rca victor 1964 lp entitled the best of chet atkins wa issued in both mono ( lpm 2887 ) and simulated stereo ( lsp-2887e ) .
1	sent to a friend and now they love to hear him sing also . hope he recovers from his operation . thanks
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline , like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice . i wa curious so i checked her out , i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift . i think that a 12 song compilation would be enough , and trust me . it wa enough . the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated , patsy is also quite ugly and can not carry a tune . after you are done burning this album , also burn anything by alison krauss , emmylou harris , loretta lynn and old dolly parton .
1	how can your toe not tap to this one . mar knock it out of the stratosphere again .
0	he tried something new , but it did not work .
1	the unique voice of bonnie tyler combined with the emotional presentation of the song lyric combine to make this a timeless and classic favorite .
0	the song is great , but the quality of the download from amazon is absolutely horrendous . i will never purchase music from amazon again . very disappointed .
1	. then you will love this . if you enjoy autotunes and song about being an independant woman who married for status , then what are you doing here ?
0	bwb is a great collaboration , but this album dropped the ball . every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any genre . the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work . i am not sure what intent for that wa , but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through , not this .
0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time .
1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market . blur , frank black , cranberry , the posy , jellyfish and others-what is not to like ? the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance ( guitar mostly ) of a quality so good you will be amazed . too bad that , in the end , suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist .
0	i actually like instrumentals , but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration . also , all of the song did not download with the album . that wa the most disappointing . maybe next time .
0	this is a bootleg release from dubious source . i have no idea why amazon even allows this to be listed , but do yourself a favor and save your money . there is no legitimate issue of this 2-fer . if you see this release , it is a bootleg .
0	embedded drm prevents burning amazon.com downloaded mp3 to a cd . digital player only . i do not recommend these downloads for this reason .
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
1	this is my favorite version of nessun dorma bar none and i include in this , pavrotti , domingo , etc . although they are supposedly more tecnically correct , i am so taken by the emotion in boccellis voice that there is no comparison for me .
0	it doe not work , i bought it 2 or 3 time this wa a digital purchase
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july 31 , 1964 at age 39 , his legion of fan simply refused to let go . from that point to 1984 no le than 34 of his rca single release would make the country chart , seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot 100. not even the late , great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour . i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef .
0	dear fireflight , please release electro-pop under another name or a side project . this will , i believe , alienate your current fan , i know it ha me . if i wanted christian katy perry , then i would listen to , uh , old katy perry .
1	screechy , and eerie , this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar .
0	not listenable . you are better off just donating to get nothing in return .
1	i saw paul simon live 2 day before this album came out . usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff , you generally do not want to hear it , you wan na hear the hit . this wa a special case . he played about 5 or 6 song from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more . i wa blown away . he talk about how he spent some time in the amazon , going on a spiritual journey , drinking this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca , and seeing spirit .
1	if nothing else , i highly recommend light by battleme . great haunting song that replay in my head over and over . i can even see the image of jax following juice in his truck a this song is being played .
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist , but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad . i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
1	i had extremely high expectation for mumford & son new album babel after listening to their first release over and over . so not too surprisingly i wa a little disappointed at first . but after a few play through , it grew on me and , while i still believe sigh no more is better album , babel is still a great cd of it own right . i am not a professional reviewer , so i will keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite track ( in no particular order ) .
0	this is not the song i wanted , and i do not know how to download it . i miss the old day , when you bought a song and then you actually owned it . how can i embed this in a powerpoint ? how could i use it in a photo slideshow ? grrr . im hopelessly left behind by technology and im only 33
0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment , and i despaired of having a flawless product . the cd came through in perfect condition however . i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk . when i played the cd , i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection , so i will not be able to use it any longer for my walk . unfortunately , i had to open the package in order to determine this , so i am out of luck a far a returning it is concerned !
0	i managed to listen to this entire album without buying it . that wa one of the best thing i have done . let me say up front that i do not care a whit about ms. winehouses personal life . and i have no problem with odd voice ( or even weak voice when the music is right , ala eric clapton ) . here , i just do not see what all the fuss is about . the voice is pedestrian , the style is borrowed , the arrangement are second rate , the song are , in my view , incredibly boring , and the overall product quality is nil .
1	this song is a true testimony for me , with god i do have the victory
1	i fell in love with this song on ghost ship . i had to do some research to find the actual song , a it is not on the album , but i am glad i found it . it is so pretty , and the singer ha a beautiful voice .
0	i wish i could give this album le than a star . the charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good review on this garbage . snake oil salesman josh feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple . josh will soon have his child do kid bop christian album for sure . if i were amazon or any other business i would block josh from all other future endeavor .
1	i have this on an lp record and finally found it here . the entire collection is great fun with the monster singing their own song .
1	xawesomehave heard this song done a number of way this by far is one of the best
0	sorry . but , that is ridiculous ( my opinion ) .
0	this guy is not funny . he is mean spirited and intolerant . i hated it . i am sorry i spent my money on it .
0	it would not download properly . cant hear it !
1	a few of the song are out of show order , but glad to see they put all the big song on it this season . wish a cd version wa offered , though .
1	this music relaxes and soothes . i am anxiously awaiting the next damien escobar cd .
1	my first exposure to this song wa in a disney cartoon . back when mtv played music , my parent purchased dtv video on laser disc that had pop music set to disney animation . this wa my favorite one of them all . i still love this song . for me it is both nostalgic and upbeat .
0	seriously ? no wonder black people laugh at u . i think it is time white people ( and all musician for that matter ) start bringing actual musician ( for the generation who may not know what that is , it is people with rhythm and who pick up these funny thing called instrument ) back into the recording studio . this synthesized stuff is too tacky for word . it give me elevator and walmart sense-memory . i do not even think this is good enough for a musak award .
0	i am trying to award this zero star but am forced to give it one . careful - most of the review here are for the 1994 broadway revival - which give high mark . this mp3 recording is for the 2008/9 london revival . the london recording is dreadful - truly awful . carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung . give this one a miss . try any of the others you find here instead . in fact this is so badly misrepresented by amazon by using the wrong review i am going to ask for my money back .
1	a a wildland firefighter travailing the country , this song hit home for me and my boy . what a great sad story .
1	this is a wonderful soundtrack for a beautiful and thoughtful show . highly recommended that you see the show . currently playing in lahaina , maui , hawaii .
0	it is either badly done or just a really bad idea . elvis voice sound rough . i do not recall thinking that when i heard his original recording . it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match . it take away from his greatness rather than enhancing it . i will not be buying any more of the song from this album . i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard do not be cruel and hound dog played on my radio over 50 year ago . re-release more mix of his original if you must , priscilla , but please do not do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duet either .
0	if you like the movie you love the soundtrack , i know i did
0	it kept me in shape reaching for the next tune button . the dodo have 2 song that i listened to all the way to the end , all the rest were just too pathetic .
0	wow , what a load of garbage . if you watch the movie , the music might make sense . a a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it , the album is an epic fail . the cellist , dave eggar , might be accomplished and all , but that doe not really come across on this album . and if you are a fan of amy lee or evanescence , there is nothing to see here . amys vocal appear on maybe 5 % of the whopping 30 minute the album play for . the one song amy wrote for the album , push the button , is easily the effort worst track .
1	just what i needed to get into the spirit of the holiday . absolutely love it . so nice and mellow . highly recommended .
0	this album just did not do it for me . i got it when it came out , because i have all their cd and love them to death . it is too girly and poppy for me , high-pitched . the lyric are not all that clear , and do not mesh well together to mean one thing . most of all , the melody of the song are hard to listen to . you know how some song are just . difficult for the ear to enjoy ? these song are fine most of the time . but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody ( or the singing ) is difficult to listen to .
0	first of all , you can barely make out most of what they are saying . the production value are terrible . i could have done a better job with a 1980s 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining . in fact , i am pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version . secondly , the message is stupid . they do not really have anything worthwhile to say , and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind .
1	great time to have this a an anthem , i change the lyric to dancing through the wire b/c i am champion sorry katie , but that is what it felt like to me . i had to dance through wire to be with her , dangerous and not a good thing to do .
1	it is a good song with nice lyric . the beat is slow jam style . may help ppl understand to listen to their mate before the relationship come to an end .
0	what a horrible song to write about the awful deed you did . innocent child were involved ! the lyric are atrocious . i know that because i read them online . you can never understand a word this woman say .
1	fascinatingly unique . lin manuel ha created something that changed music . i can not stop listening to this album because every time i listen to it , i learn more about not only the music but about race issue and history . can not recommend it highly enough
0	not exactly what i wanted but it ok. wow they require twelve mote word before i can leave this review .
1	the greatest band no one ha ever heard of ha done it again . how doe a band get better and better after every album is beyond me . happy to call them my favorite band with one of the greatest song writer ever .
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike ( and try to avoid ) about hollywood production . terrible .
0	not really the song . generic . so disappointing in this purchase
1	great song to work out to ! love it . inspiring !
0	horrible . i only bought it because the ex-girlfriend wanted it . i wish there wa a no star rating .
0	love this song , but wa very disappointed in how soft the background vocal are . hard to achieve a good blend .
0	it is advertised a the explicit version , it is not
0	major disappointment . always been a huge bh fan from way back . the songwriting is trite and uninspired . take no chance musically . dont get me started on the ridiculous political statement he is trying to make with the title track . utterly forgettable album .
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong . even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song , with each album outshining the last one . swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best-to-date album speak now , which , like fearless , is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to .
0	considering the review and the pedigree and the musicianship . just no soul , the singing . voice , doe not work ( for me ) i get - that they are good - just reminded me of the good stuff from the 70
1	this song is beautiful beyond word .
1	it is a great cd ! i enjoy every song . you need to be aware , though , that there are 3 song that would not be considered christmas song . they are amazing musician . good quality sound .
1	what a voice , do not really have to say any more .
0	it would be nice if i could put this song on my player , but it is locked in the stupid cloud and i can not get to it . i am buying future song from itunes .
1	amazing album been with j. cole since the warm-up , good to see he still keep it real .
0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music . i also find toilet humor funny like most men . however , i find this cd completely pointless and tedious . it is not at all funny , and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found . every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same - a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a 14-year-old over unclassifiable , unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally .
1	the band perry is amazing and i think this is their best song yet . followed closely by hip to my heart ! listen to this song once and you are hooked !
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons line in the 1997 film a good a it get , you make me wan na be a better man , this song embodies what a woman want in a relationship . from the opening note , you will be sucked into the melody and simple lyric that comprise wan na make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day . although this song is not written by gibson himself , it doe expose music lover to his rich vocal that tickle your ear drum .
1	good music throughout . always favor original song . mix up tempos/styles- appeal to all age . she is a really good singer . glad to see her doing so well and overcoming a rough time with positive forward sailing .
0	please stop playing this song a hold music ! is your goal to get me to hang up ?
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
1	possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie . this soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie . nothing fancy . just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fit perfectly with the time period . a perfect example of how le can be far more effective .
0	purchased but did not download to my playlist
0	this is not the theme from enterprise . this is the same song , where my heart will take me , that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series .
1	this is a very good album . saw him perform some of these song at sacramento , ca in 1971 .
0	this song becomes more and more depressing a time go along so i deleted it .
0	love the goat , but this song . well , seems they used so much creative energy in coming up with the title they had little left for the actual song .
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube . when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system . after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production . hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice , but that wasnt allowed to come through . the second song , edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background . the piano virtually drowned out her voice .
1	listen to it so much , had to order another one ! want to make sure it doe not wear out !
1	this is perfect rendition . i found this song because it wa written about in a book i wa reading and i wanted it . i had also heard it on the radio and wa looking for the perfect rendition and this is it .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away . kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill , from marrying kim kardashian , to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy-winning album of the year . now , for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney , the question is have they have better in their art , well the answer is absolutely no .
1	you either get it or you do not . but if you do get it then you will love it . unique , spacey , cosmic , trippy , technical and melodic . overall it is a great solid album . recommended to fan of voivod , toxik , watchtower , rush , vector , atheist , cynic or any other technical/prog band
0	i am very disappointed i thought this wa posted be a regular size cd i had no idea this wa a mini cd and i do not have a mini cd player at all so i could not even use this i am very disappointed on my purchase them to keep u posted on line i had the right to if i give it a one star rating i thought this wa post be a regular size cd i waste my money nobody should not buy this because you are gon na be disappointed when you receive it
0	made in aut in 1996 , serial # 33215-2 , playing time 51:45 this is album # 9 from canada self-proclaimed metal queen , and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album . emotional rain , her previous album , displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor , but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre . i like la singing , and la & 2p demonstrates her talent .
1	sound clear and no disappointment in quality . i am very happy with it and love the song . go for it !
1	one of the realest rapper in the game right now . j.cole ha never disappointed and this album is no exception . 2014 forest hill dive is his best album to date and best album of 2014 for sure !
0	i swear this is a very good parody of bob dylan singing of christmas song . it is , is not it ? please tell me it is . please .
1	i love it . thanks . the cd arrived on time and wa a described
1	first cd i have bought in a long time . sturgill simpson should have won a grammy for this album in my opinion , and i am not even that much into country music . this guy is in a genre of his own , and it kick a $ . can not wait to see what he come up with on his next album .
0	a nice album comprised of 12 track which have already been published under the how-the-west-was-swung series by wr record ( vol . 1 through 10 ) . very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release , may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best-of compilation . if you have bought the wr record series , you do not necessarily need this album .
1	i still do not know what this song is about , but there is certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the song . the tune is catchy and the lyric are powerful . if you do not believe me , watch the video .
1	album of the year ! i love every song ! my only complaint is that the album is too short , so quality over quantity is definitely the case here !
0	this composition , while ambitious and promising at certain point , never really take off . the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument , but doe not go anywhere with it . the theme never develop , and the variation are not all that different from each other . i had high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion , but it wa just more of the same . i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction , however .
1	who would not like jb ? he is excellent- what is priceless ? amazon prime- gave a whole of his music free .
1	i have an original promo copy of this unknown gem - from when it wa released . after year of play , i needed a replacement and i found this pristine copy for a very fair price . it arrived sooner than expected and packaged properly for shipment . thanks to amazon and their affiliate .
1	okay , after using that annoying pun , allow me to elaborate a little bit : lee greenwood is one hell of a performer ! i have to admit , this is the first album of his i have bought ; and no , in case you are wondering , the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd ( it did not hurt thing , though ) . i will get right to the album , save yall any more small talk . i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting ; after all , usa is a superbly written song .
0	let me break this down , in a rather incomplex fashion , for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan . nirvana , while rebellious , offered nothing new , or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era . i understand , and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there , but cobain did not speak to you . in fact , he loathed you , a he did all of his loyal fan . that is the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such a nirvana .
0	i know lot of folk love this album . i have been a huge boc fan since they started in 72. i can not listen to this album . except for the remake of astronomy , the song are awful . boc always have great song , very melodic , a pleasure to listen to . this is not true on this album . one bad album out of all their album is not a tragedy . they continue to put out good album to this day . i will be seeing them yet again in san francisco on july 20. i guarantee they will not be playing any song from this dog .
1	while clearly a tremendous technical achievement , this 2cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression - both explosive and contemplative . i love it !
1	oh yes ! this is one of tjose song where if you need a little bit encouragement just pop it on and a the title say just let it go .
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music . it just suck really bad and ha no love in it .
0	lucinda williams , the finest songwriter of the century , need to return to the great song she wrote in the beginning of her career . the only song on west that i really liked wa west . i will continue to buy all her album anyway , i think she is great !
1	who can explain god love ? well , hallorin doe a great job . this song touch my soul and brings tear to my eye every time i listen to it . although we mess up , god clean u up and restores u . his love is not of this world . hallelujah !
1	nice sound but you need a very quiet environment to listening yo yo ma
1	what can i say , great song from my teenage year . now i have my teenager liking it . lol
0	i have ordered 2 time the same product from amazon and the 5th track had a problem on both .
1	beautiful , haunting and take me back in time . ani williams is the best when it come to doing her version of egyptian music . her music just feel right
1	it is not the original version , but he get close to it . i had heard this song back in 1993 and wa very moved by the lyric . i inquired at several record store and could never find out who song it . i finally wa able to google it ( 2010 ) and found the exact song by eddy grant . the song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color . great song and powerful message , a must listen for the cultural sensitive person .
0	what ha happened to country music ? i call this crock ! let u get back to the steel guitar and the fiddle and the cheatin and drinkin song that have a story .
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performance of this song . this guy ha a real magic to him . his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison . he will make eye contact with just one person and for just a moment . but you can tell that that person is not likely to forget that moment .
1	his voice is tempered with gravel , but the word are still magic . the album only get better with a few listening . he ha been missed , and this may be one of his last work , but it wa worth the wait .
1	manakin moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band waxing poetics , who were a regional favorite in the norfolk , virginia , area . it is a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind . highly recommended . wannabe singer , just try to learn the lyric on this one !
0	it pain me to see so many 1 star review coming from dylan own fan base . i have been a fan for over 40 year , and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered . bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now , but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time . this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated , but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place , and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate .
1	great song i have always love that song
1	the long awaited debut album from stalley doe not disappoint . trunk rattling bass , ode to old school and midwest pimping at it best !
1	i love this tune , it my fav dance tune off all time , this tune should always be remebered and should be loved forever
0	a lot of people have praised this disc - but i am not one of them . this recording is many thing , but the soundtrack it is not ! despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also written by him . this disc ha the song that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score ! despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film background music .
1	i like music and i find certain song that are inspiring and energizing . i have picked certain song from different album that i use to worship the lord and uplift me through the day
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent , in which sound engineer over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder , but damaging the dynamic range . this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war . it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail 2010 remaster of pretty hate machine , and subsequent release of classic beatles record . the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency .
0	i heard a lot of good thing about this album so i bought it only to become disappointed . many of the song seem forced and repetitive if other hit they have had . i have it an honest listen several time before actually returning it-for me , it wa that bad . about the only good thing i can say is that blink 182 ha an awesome drummer .
1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest . this is a great song for lover .
1	it is prince ! plain and simply a legend ! # rip
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) .
0	i just came here to read the description , trying to figure out why this showed up on a prime search for christian music . three is nothing christian about it . if anything it is new age .
1	excellent single to celebrate the 51th anniversary of the artist that ha been in the top of the chart for the last 25 year . this single keep you moving unless you are dead and did not know it . lol excellent !
0	this sounded like something that someone just threw together . i could not use any of it and none of the song were complete .
0	not at all what i expected . kind of insipid .
1	i like this version of the song . it is very smooth and sweet . the harmony is gentle and it lyric are thoughtful .
0	i always liked this song . i like the werewolf of london too . he is a great classic rock artist to listen to .
0	the album is great so do not think the star are for that . it get lower star rating because it is censored . the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this . when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [ explicit ] but one that is clean ha nothing like [ censored ] or [ clean ] next to it . jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it .
0	the worst album i ever purchased wa nevermind . i had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fan recommended it so highly . but i am sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down . it is hard to listen to more than 3 song at one go ! i found the album to be monotonous & boring . the song are very bad and the vocal are awful .
1	praise god , another sweet jam from lecrae !
0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim , after i came across it while looking for another music title . i remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtrack , and thought that this would be similar ; but wa disappointed . i thought that this recording seemed fake , a if made by a synthesizer ( or in a bathroom ) . the track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop . like you , i base my purchase decision on the experience of others .
1	this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric , interesting production and musicianship . it blur the genre of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence . for fan of progressive , emotional and electronic music , this is album is for you . check adam . 01 at [ . ]
0	this title is mangled - disco beat , sputtering word that are incomprehesible , then dead silence .
0	this cd set is okay but get a little monotonous after a while . i wa hoping it would be better but it is okay .
1	i can relate to this song all the way around because my father passed away in 2011 and he including my mother and i knew it wa his time to let go . i listen to this song in memory of him .
0	i understand this song is supposed to be all political and deep and whatnot , but her voice and the sound of this song altogether make me want to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that i never have to listen to one second of this song ever again for a long a i live . i am very diverse in my music taste but i hate this song , i really think this is the worst song ever to be released in the history of time .
0	great music obviously , but awful remastering - even worse than the 3cd chrome box . sound thin and tinny , like it is coming out of a transistor radio . the mighty chrome deserve better , but they will never get it a long a they are on cleopatra .
0	bought this from amazon .the song are not in original order that wa on album , buy the original .if you can much better
1	great song . no one but him could sing it with such feeling . love that song and singer . thank you george .
1	i thought it wa fabulous ! i am the same age a barbra and knew she wa going to be something special the first time i heard back when . this is her best yet .
0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep . you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace . when her voice leaf you assumably asleep for 20 minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire . the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect a the fire in the fireplace .
1	i have listened to this album since i wa a kid and each time it take me back . forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music . i love that it take ancient song we all know and love and put pure soul into them . my favorite track are the overture , every valley , lift up your head , and he shall purify and of course halleujah . all i can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why i love christmas and the holiday season .
1	i think this is a great album . there is not one song i dislike on this cd . i defiantly recommend buying this album .
0	this is a rather strange compilation . the individual track have little in common , other than that they were made for movie . this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal . it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music . the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track . this mixed bag ha very little going for it . it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner .
1	very smooth ! keep the music going brother , do not sellout to the usher , rkelleys r & b of mainstream etc . stay pure .
0	though , i will take some responsibility . i downloaded from itunes & should/could have listened to the sample . my bad . how can they use the same name a an already existing band ? and produce music like this while using that name ? really , it should be an outrage . i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for . oh well . i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness . hopefully it will not come up in random very often .
0	not a great a his previous cd , some great tune but mostly a disappointment . i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an mp3 would best suit you .
0	wanted the song with the word . this is just instrumental .
0	this wa purchased for someone else . i do not like it because i think it is an annoying song . not my type of music .
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one . very short a little over a minute . buyer should be notified . have never seen such a short rendition and be charged more like a sample .
1	love dangelo and this song . this one of those song you can enjoy anywhere , sitting with your special someone thinking this is about u or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying it melody , doe not matter it just a great song . d angelos style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy make me happy .
0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out 30 year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mar hotel and have to say that while i am a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp . it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp . my old mobile fidelity japan pressed 30 year old copy sound much more natural and is superior in almost every way .
1	this is a great album no doubt . the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard . fade to black is an absolute classic . maybe missing a little ball though in this one .
1	r kelly by far ha left the r & b wanta be in the dark . r kelly ha produced hit for some of the biggest name in the musinc industry . to come out with a album that totally switch up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing . this album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really want to hear ( music ) . again , go get it !
0	i thought this wa sung my dottie rambo , did not like it since it wasnt . i wa after hers not someone el .
0	yee haw , wen de music biziniss iz filled with kommy fashist amerikah hater like de dixy chiks and sistum uf a down . dese fokes dun come out and dun speke to u tru amerikans , the 20 % uf u dat are left . we do not nede yur bush-bashin you 70 % + uf amerkah , you dun just git out of amerkah and dun moov to kuba ! yee haw ! i dun tell yu wut , this musik iz a breth uf fresh air to all de bush bashers ! just dun git , ither you dun support a prezident ( only if he repubilikan of course ) or you dun leave !
1	this come from one of the more obscure gerge harrison album but will always be one of my favorite song !
0	not a favorite . i prefer a more celtic sounding version of this song . i wa disappointed in this version . sorry .
0	dissapointed with this one . love johnny cash but the sound on this one is not good . sorry that i downloaded it to my kindle .
0	this review is only for this version of the album ( the remastered expanded edition ) . the mastering sound overly compressed , and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough . the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track . it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album . people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album .
1	this song still hold up nearly 30 year late . dramatic , big hook , great sounding production .
0	wow , another album from brmc where they can not decide what kind of music they want to make : rocker or slow , drawn out ( and imo dull ) folk song . i really liked war machine & aya . those i bought and enjoyed . i will be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again : )
1	el-p continues to impress . each of his album is very good , but they all build on the brilliance of the previous release . a true artist in every sense . really good album ! get it if you are remotely into rap/hip hop music in any way .
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tune over and over again everywhere you go . this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling and an upbeat tune . i enjoy listening to this over and over again . i would love to find more of these kind of new tune . new to me anyway .
1	he is sings about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved his m music . i love this cd !
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	in general i dislike live recording , for two reason . in an actual concert , audience are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day . no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control - a if that wa the artist last word on the music . this is grossly unfair , and review rarely acknowledge the difference , but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work .
0	i like bar and band version of song , but this ha too much not funny in it for me . it is one thing to be drunk and hear story and laugh about shooting your neighbor cat , sleeping with your cousin , sister , brother , dad , or whatever else is in this music . line about the anus detract from the music for me . clean it up , be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music .
1	this is by far the best collection of rare earth there wa . i say wa co it look like at the writing of this that it is now out of print. ( sad ) . luckily i do own it . what make this the best one of all is the inclusion of every now and then we get to go on down to miami . this song wa never released a a single but should have been . every song on here is a winner , you have got the hit and the best of ( almost ) album track . but if mowtown happens to read this please .
0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here . i remember seeing an interview of the newest ( at the time ) leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos . sure we are entitled to forgiveness , but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory . after rjd ha passed no le . onto the music . the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire .
0	this is one of my favs from a boy named goo , the cd best known for the goo goo doll breakthrough hit name . this mp3 version of flat top sound horrible - it sound like some of the downloads my sister friend used to get from limewire , where there wa this hissing that sounded like someone wa running a drum stick along the cymbal . i have owned this on cd several time b/c i have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad song on abng , and i am not always in the mood for the downbeat long way down ( trk1 ) .
0	i wanted to buy this song but when i tried to preview it , the song is just not the one . please check it .
0	sounded like a mexican band ; not country ; not my style . every song sounded the same ; no variety . if you are looking for country , this is not for you .
1	they keep getting better and better , every song is talking directly to me ! your side of the bed , listen to the word - amazing !
0	i had no idea what they sounded like , but once i downloaded this song , i thought , what a waste of time ! do not bother unless you are a fan . i am certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon !
1	i absolutely love this song . they sound awesome together . being a woman with a busy job and a husband with the same this song make complete sense to me .
1	they just do not make song like this anymore . very good song . recived in great condition .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	if you want a variety of beethoven music , this is an excellent selection . beautiful , beautiful music . relaxing , uplifting , moving . it just doe not get any better !
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash ha everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand ?
1	she is amazing singer and she is even better live . i wish i could find all of her song live !
0	absolutely horrible pressing . save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster . i got this on a daily deal , but even at that price , it wasnt worth it . sound distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range . the bass is nonexistent , and wa quieter than most of my other record . i have listened to it about 3 time now , just to see if it needed to break in a bit . nope ! just horrible .
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy . i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago . kind of like the 72/73 miami dolphin . i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl . same here with chicago . 60 and 70 with their intense musical and political statement . and then 80 and 90 mega wimpy commercial hit . chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60 and 70 .
1	this is my favorite mark knopfler song . i can not say it is typical , but it is soooo beautiful ! randy travis also recorded it , but i prefer mks version .
0	so why are you asking me to review it ? this is a stupid automated review process controlled by software clearly written by some idiot programmer . stop pestering your customer to work for you without compensation by writing review !
0	i expected to get the song i heard on youtube , not this one with half of the lyric deleted . not what i wanted at all .
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock , rod should not attempt to do old standard . strictly commercial , no heart .
1	what a great song . the fact that my daughter love it a much a i do is a bonus . the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done and modern curious george is pure greatness !
1	this group , especially this album , ha ruined me . i literally can not listen to any other music for more than a couple song before playing babel from start to finish . these guy are in a league of their own . i am fairly certain i will never enjoy a group music more than i enjoy mumford & son .
0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had heard . it turn out that is the only good song on it . the rest of the cd is not anything i want to listen to . what else can i say ? steer clear .
1	good quality but you have to download amazing music to have to song in you phone
0	it is unfortunate that there is not a negative rating scale . the disc took five week to arrive . both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal , even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging . recycled the day it arrived .
1	this is a very good cd for the price . i bought this cd just for that one song that i did not have but wanted .
0	i did not like any of this music . terrible selection . i am going to try and get a refund for this purchase .
0	i downloaded this song twice and both time the lead singer channel had much le volume than the version i reviewed . almost like the right-left channel were not set the same . somebody need to have a look at the setting on this download .
0	i hate the song sweet home alabama . kid rock combined this song with that now i can not get it out of my head . not that sweet home alabama is a bad song but i have heard way too many time . i grew up in mississippi and i wa worn out on the song by time i wa five .
0	this is another case where le is more . i found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting . instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i wa caught in a deluge .
1	not a good a the first one , but sequel rarely are . it is good none the le .
1	i love anything royalty free . this album ha everything in 30 sec , 60 sec , and full track . these track range from movie track to high energy rock . with this album you get over 50 track . i will use this high quality music and in my independent film project .
1	love it , best vocal on history , oh my gosh , unbelievable .
1	love this song so much . reminds u to pray , give it to god , move on and trust ! great song of encouragement !
0	with no doubt in my mind this is the worst unplugged album i have seen . katty perry simply is a studio artist . doe not worth to see her live singing . bad bad bad
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their mind .
1	it doe not disappoint . at all . not even a little bit . i am beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong . brilliant !
1	al stewart did some good work , only a few song had airplay . peter white wa the guitarist . a must for any 70s-80s playlist .
1	great album ! they have such wonderful voice . i wish i could sing like that .
0	the live version is not the version i wanted . do not care for all that talking during the song . i deleted it .
0	i am a huge fan going way back , so i will not say directly that it suck ( but it definitely lack gravitational pull ) . bob tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these christmas standard ! the zydeco arrangement on must be santa is kinda fun , but his shredded voice just make me imagine that i am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube . i feel this cd could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health class .
1	the presentation of this well-know musical piece is superbly performed by the london philharmonic orchestra . if you have not listened to it in a while , i strongly suggest that you revisit it . you will not be disappointed .
1	love this corney song i play for anyones birthday
0	i wa a huge fan of dm album like music for the mass , black celebration , and violator . i also enjoyed people are people , some song on broken frame and much of speak and spell . but , most of this record never did anything for me . it is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80 that i did not really try to like from band i liked . but , a few song like lie to me are good a i recall , but people are people is a stronger early mode post speak and spell choice .
0	i like the beat & the tune , but could do without the lyric . where al word crime ha similar beat & tune but happier , fun lyric .
1	i wa too guilty to like this song . i mean , the beibs ? but once i learned that ed sheeran co-wrote it , i could live with myself . all is again right with the world .
1	i enjoyed the music ; however , would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download . would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd .
0	she can not even do a soft song without it being at the schubert or oneil theater . i would suggest you get the ala carte from her massive library here at itunes . there are some great thing .
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes . i realized that it wasnt him a all ( from the very beginning of it ) . i did not like the song just from the clip i heard . if you ask me , this group or singer sin synthetic , are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame . i almost bought the cd here from amazon . i am so glad that i did not .
1	i heard this song on the radio and loved it . it really make you think if jesus wa never born we would not have christmas . jesus is the reason for the season and this song reminds u all of that .
1	strangely oriental but totally captivating with those five note in the opening . absolutely love this one . keep it up tom rhett !
0	i am truly a j-hud fan and have waited for this cd forever . it wa a truly let down for me with a few exception if it is not love , my heart , i am his only woman , invisible and naturally spotlight best song on the cd ! i am shocked that this is what clive davis had in mind for her . even though kelly clarksons my december had one hit on it and davis told her to start over and she said no . i would rather jennifer to of done it her way then his . but i still love ya jenn hopefully better next time !
0	oddly amusing song . wa curious after hearing the song with her and new hubby chad kroeger . lyric for the younger audience , good beat !
1	i am jockin on these hater , man . this song is a euphoric mix of culture + party . five star .
0	the mix on this song is awful , the background noise take over which tell me they are trying to hide a lot of flaw in nias voice . she is from the t.v . show dance mom and should have let abby lee miller produce her song . abby a she doe in everything that she work on put out excellence song for the girl she produce . nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby : a this song is awful , even the title is bad what doe a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life ?
0	it is an okay song , but the whole reason i downloaded it , wa i wa looking for a kelli glover song . maybe she is in the background , but not worth the $ .99 . sorry folk . i wish kelli would put up a website and let u download some song of hers . she can sing .
0	< a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/harvey-the-moonglows-2000/dp/b0019gn3zs/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > harvey & the moonglows 2000 < /a > if you prefer original version search under the moonglows and you will find 20th century collection among others with original cut , and harvey fuqua singing lead .
1	i am just starting to get interested in classical music . this a great bargain . i do not like all of the song but there is a wide variety ; some very familiar . if you want a great overall selection at a great price , this is a must have .
0	i am very disappointed ! the wording on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original 80 artist . it is not ! it is a mix sung by a wedding singer/cruise line type of band . is it even legal for a cd to be published with remake of original artist song without the permission of the original artist ? hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song . very misleading and disappointing !
1	the piano is very subtle and haunting almost i love the pause in between and the beat . it all gel together . i love the song , buy in !
0	not what i expected and some song so sad i cried .
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary : buy of simply find it on you tube
0	csn , deja vu , after the gold rush . these were the album that helped to define an era for some of u . csn never supassed that first album , either collectively or individually though they did have some good song on some album . neil young wa able to transcend the era , that is why he still is a vital recording artist . nostalgia make me sad . i do not need it .
0	not sure the guy is signing , but it is not brett young , that is for damn sure ! ekkk
0	this one is not good at all . used to be a fan of his but he is fallen . he is fallen far . it is a sad effort to be honest .
0	i bought this song on itunes trying to respecect the copyright law however the import processing is confusing and i still have no idea how to put this on my computer . i thiink the system should be more user friendly because if i can not figure it out normal folk that use this service everyday ( like my parent ) who are le computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer .
0	wow , talk about zero originality ! what do you do when you can not come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental~ what else !
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp , it is the live version from the chuck berry film , hail ! hail ! rock n roll . it is misleading to label it re-mastered when it is a different version from the original .
1	mix in well with other song in cardio workout . when you get a little winded this will help keep you up .
0	god imagine dragon are a one hit wonder that have not gone away .
0	the song is not being sung . it is an orchestra playing the instrumental . given it is not what i expected i rated it 2 star . but if you are into orchestra and instrumentals you may love it . could play it at bed time .
1	i love this cd . every single song . it is one of my all time favorite . i feel like a couple of the song are straight out of my life . highly recommend !
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash . it is a shame what pass for hip-hop these day . people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric , which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all , because lil wayne is whack . i am not a hater , i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all . he is just another average , untalented , main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pas off a hip-hop .
1	great song , heard it in life is strange
0	ala this wa not the original recording . nostalgia aint what it used to be .
1	i hated their voice at first , and i hated the lyric . but i listened to the whole thing twice , and it actually is kinda catchy . but everyone is different . for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it really just depends on how the music ring inside your ear .
1	some good music from the past that get only light current radio play ( i have not heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly ) . and most of these will not get much play 30 year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality song not heard much today .
1	a good mix of common song from merry england ! - i particularly enjoyed the sound of a man from the 16th century bemoaning all of the progress and newfangled fashion that were destroying the heart of the england he knew .
1	this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best song on this soundtrack are all of them . if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
1	little and ashley harmonize very well in this recording . the lyric bring vision of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bell . who doe not like sleigh bell ? i like it !
1	it is light hearted and happy . it fit in nicely a background for a slideshow i did .
0	mediocre compared to other tribute . just did not enjoy these rendition the same way i have other vsq performance
1	one of mary well best . no problem with download .
0	i got it for free . at 1st i did not really like it . i like black veil bride and the fray . it is just not my kind of music . now i like this song though . i had to hear it a couple of time before it hit home .
0	this is terribly , embarrassingly boring . i know that phil spector is not dead yet , but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he is been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis . if you thought garbage wa garage , you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for an entire landfill . in either case , take my advice and head in the opposite direction . in & out of control is nothing more than disney music for the cutting set .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	this is an absolutely wonderful cd for all ages- listening to it gave me a sense of being lighter a those stress , that you might not realize your carrying throughout the day , just fall away leaving you with a sense of peace and serenity .
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr , and i loved it . it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility , with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal . best track is dig , but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended ; it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape .
0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan . but this cd just suck . the music is great a usual , . but the lyric will lose you . there are two song on this cd that are ok , . but just ok. they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again . the rest of the lyric are just hogwash . they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all . erg : ay caramba , one note samba , la la la la bamba .
1	what a great song ! gwen stefani is an awesome lead singer . i have always been a fan ! this song never get old .
1	air return with love 2 - their best work , in my opinion , since 1998s moon safari . the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound ( do the joy ) and synth-driven scope ( be a bee ) . alternatively , the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop-tune to date with sing sang sung . with this type of contrast ( notable from quite an early stage on the album ) one ha to expect some surprise along the way .
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence . an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need it , for exampl , e because of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder . a complete and utter waste of money and time . this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence , but will certainly line the pocket of daniel goleman .
1	wonderful contemporary arrangement by gary bonner of these wonderful old standby hymn !
1	this song is truly inspiring . i first heard it during a worship session at a church i wa visiting . i quickly found it on amazon .
0	once i would downloaded this song , i felt deceived by the sample clip available here . cincotti definitely ha potential , but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range . he sounded rather screechy . the title track wa also somewhat misleading , because it led me to expect a slow , tender seduction song , not a sad one . i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing .
1	if this wa all you got for prime it would be worth it . amazon , i love you !
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others , but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare .
0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer . not much ! he gave it his all when singing with her , but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album . did not sound a though he wa giving it his all ! sorry !
0	bought for airline flight for off line it is in the cloud and can not lisen off line
0	i think that i must have got a bad copy because this sacd sound awful ! it sound like a cd from 1985
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation , this album is just a good or better . what ? ! if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica . if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it would not be bluegrass . when u2 decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked . that is what this is .
0	the first and only album i have not liked from floyd since final cut
1	i have been a fan for many year . this is a great collection . there is only one track i do not care for and i will skip over .
0	you could not tell this wa a live recording and i wanted a studio version .
0	i love these song but the quality of the album wa awful . every song clip horribly , especially demon . please release a better version .
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw . only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal . ( i love to hear her sing . ) if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice , you will be left wanting more . while i applaud the idea of trying something new , it did not work here . the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal . it is just that simple .
0	this is not the version that you are looking for . have not found the version sung on ondine yet . dang it !
0	i do not know what version this is but it suck . i like another version of this song i had before but ii am not gon na keep buying them to find it .
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening - and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book , little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience . not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale . but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection , i get a bit of the heebie-jeebies .
1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on . one is that we will die . another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding , heavy , jam filled album and once again , they do not disappoint at all . mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo . despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year , he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry , heavy snarling vocal performance .
0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented in many different aspect . he wa creative and every time i listened to his other show , i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked . his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field . this album is not creative nor funny . it is just hateful . mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop , fireman and snitch are , a well a fart and enema joke .
0	i bought ti for my son who is a music major . he loved it
1	i am glad i purchased this selection due the fact that i have been searching for this song and the artist . amazon try to provide this and doe such a great job . thanks
0	i love this album , but this get 2 star . it would be great if one time i would get a record from amazon that did not skip at all . last two i have purchased have had bad skipping spot .
1	top of my list . do you like to dance , to get your groove moving . elle king , where is she on the chart ? she should be ranking up there .
0	one song that is listenable but they changed from it is original composition . shame .
1	this song wa written by todd rundgren . hall and oat are good but todd the best , i think he produced them along with patti smith ( here come the night ) and lot of other artist . most of their big hit were written by todd .
1	awesome reminder of the love of god !
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success . with that gone , my guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag in 2 year while staying with andy kindler in his studio
1	heard it in a movie , and wanted it . it wa hard to find online , but amazon had it for a cheap price , very happy with this track .
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low . it not even 128bit . sound like it wa recorded on audio tape
1	this song ha just enough of a mix of pop and funk to sound very enjoyable for everyone who hears it . it is just simple and fun to listen to !
0	a much a i can scream out expletive about the grrrrrreatness of qaf the show , the soundtrack fall sadly mediocre . it tout itself a almost like being in babylon ( a dancejoint that doe not exist in real life ) , well i guess it doe in a way , but it doe not capture the whole feel of babylon . i wa expecting remixes and stuff ! where is it ? on the whole i guess it an o.k . compilation . a lot of you will not really get what i am saying but , that is okay too .
0	i thought karaoke lyric came with the music . i would buy more if i knew the lyric came with it a in other karoake music
0	poor sound track . these is a very loud drum in the background that distracts from the very good violin music . if the mixing wa better this would have been a fantastic track . unfortunately i did not hear the drum in the very short sample you hear when buying on amazon .
1	it is a very fun song that encourages you to keep your head up and enjoy life . you will turn out fine . : )
1	i have not heard anything of his since the crossover that i did not like . i can listen to him all day .
1	this band ha a great sound & this is a very unique , fun christmas song . love the stringed instrument & old big band feel .
0	i found it poorly performed and since the nutcracker is one of my favorite , i wa disappointed . do not download .
1	i have got to admit , i have had this cd since it first came out . i am just writing a review now , better late than never . i give the cd is 5 star . yes it is a mellow cd , but it is awesome . just like paul stanley 1978 kiss solo cd , ( my personal favorite ) wa the most mellow of the four , his song i feel were the stongest . just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song , the vocal and the playing is top notch . paul is a master craftsman of song .
1	always love to listen to waylon and jessi .
1	for someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music , it melody and lyric a well a it arrangement and performance , i find this cd one of the most beautiful recording of all-time . once again and a always , the great nelson riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standard from the great american songbook . this cd will take u to a musical journey a we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music .
1	i absolutely love this singer artist . she ha quite a voice and she delivers in every song she sings . enjoy !
0	by far the worst s * i have heard in a long time . poser wan na be should just give it up . fail .
0	i liked this song until i watched the video . come on . then robin thicke got twerked on by miley . ugh . while his wife played it cool for a while , eventually she left him . and finally he say he ha addiction issue . am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where the singer/actors personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song/movie ? ( see : anything by amy winehouse ; all thing brad pitt , gwyneth paltrow or rihanna )
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music , so i ordered the album . the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment . the mastering of this album is terrible . a number of the song on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect . when you hear the song live , the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance . but on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music .
1	a great classic from curtis mayfield . grew up listening to his musical creation and have always been in awe . fantastic
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on , i cringe and die a little inside . it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time . aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 line of lyric with no substance , they borrow the can-can song and make it even more irritating .
0	not clean ! still ha the word damn .
0	this is a big disappointment . this is just a awful a bionic . her voice is just nasty . i should have bought a holiday album instead of this .
1	the first cut is the deepest is a 1967 song written by cat stevens , originally released by p. p. arnold in may 1967. stevens own version originally appeared on his album new master in december 1967. this one is ok , but cat version is the best .
0	bought this a a gift for a family member who love musical . the song title do not appear on screen when they are playing . very frustrating !
1	have one thing to say , i love this song and listen to it every day . this song is a must have . very relaxing .
0	i bought this album with an open mind . i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack , mendocino county line . that wa the only good track . i thought that with the like of sheryl crow , bonnie raitt and rob thomas , this would be a comperable a the santana compilation . i wa sorely disappointed . the other celebrity artist sang back-up . you could barely even hear them . this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun , but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror .
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song . dated late eighty early ninety production ha not dated too well . this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and cole were at da top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio .
1	love this song ! it is very catchy and very cute . this whole album is such a wonderful find . my infant son and i really have enjoyed every song , but this is one of our top 3 !
1	great cd by one of the top band around today .
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day , wa nice just to purchase the song i wanted .
1	love it . and just got exactly what i wanted and no more . save bzillians this way ! greatest invention ever in the music industy . thanks !
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think . if you are stuck in the early 70s-or bust mentality of cooper-fandom , then this album is not for you . but zcs is strong from beggining to end , with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious . adaptable , i like girl , remarkably insincere , all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them , mainly because of the lyric .
1	midwest rock band pay homage to long tradition of not-quite-live live album . high energy song punctuated by strong harmony . fun record if you like old school rock and are looking for something new .
0	horrible . sings through his nose and steal all of his guitar lick from others . do not bother with this one .
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r & b , you are in for some rare treasure . this is not one of those kind of cd . the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded , poorly performed , and lacking in appealing hook . this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost .
0	100 % trash with disgusting text and poor music .
0	it is a typical contemporary song . it make a great high school reunion song . for me it is john mayer debut song . you will know what all this time wa for , indicates his confidence in his song .
0	not the same singer that did the original hit like secret lover and always .
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
0	sound like he just woke up 2 second earlier . the voice is no american idol or american trash . it is worse . and a squeaky guitar string top the annoyance .
1	from one of my favorite movie , this song can bring out so much emotion and feeling . love love love it .
1	i will make this brief a usual . tha animatrix dvd is what turned me onto anime , it is also a slight bit disturbing , but you know a well a i do that u 21st century human need to be disturbed once in a while . i always loved the music from the dvd , so decided , why not get the soundtrack ? and i did . what i did not expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie ( in musical term ) . there is only one track on this cd that i do not like , and that is saying a lot .
1	if you have watched the tv show , then you already know how catchy the song are . the only difference between tv and the cd , is probably length . i have not actually verified this , but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer , and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show ? either way , a good time with good music .
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection . even if you like sinatra you will be disappointed in dylan interpretation . if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity . if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it . very dismal , not even good for elevator music .
0	a heaping pile of dung . i believe in his quest to become more like his alternative comedy , he ha evolved into the alternative to comedy . tradgedy .
0	i just finished downloading ( from the cloud ) and there is a problem . four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp ( on a window xp system ) . the bad track are : ( disc 1 ) track 04 ( disc 1 ) track 08 ( disc 2 ) track 10 ( disc 2 ) track 13 if i try to open them in window medium player , nothing happens ; the name doe not even appear in the playlist . if i try to open them in winamp , then ( disc 1 ) track 01 ( canon ) play instead ! i believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long .
0	huge wz and rz here . this album is a bit disappointing . some have equated it to an ep and i agree . i believe rob is believing any crap he put out there is cool , well . it aint . love john 5 playing and hope rob put out more serious lyric and music next time .
1	i love this song . i sing it all day every dayyy !
0	i am confused a to how to listen to this track . where do i go ? my review ha nothing to do about rihanna , she is great and i love this song . that is why i bought it ! i wa just disappointed when i went to listen to the song and i had no idea where to go . why can not it just download straight to itunes ? it would have been so much easier !
1	mr. sandman is one of the few song i can sing with gusto . of course i cange the word him to her but it work .
1	okay , i bought this for one one song . jesus savior , it s a great song and i love the message behind it . my family just sigh when i pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it . they know no matter the season that song will be played . haha
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
1	jeff williams second outing a composer for rwby is a home run . he creates wonderful music that get your blood pumping and your head bobbing . personal favorite track are shine and caffeine , but they are all great track that is just a awesome a rwby itself .
0	bernie the buffoon is an even bigger joke than i thought . bahaaaaa !
1	i had a favorite album back in high school entitled the rock album . can not seem to locate it anywhere . but here , on amazon , i can piece the album together using itunes ! voila !
1	this is a great collection of new wave jazz from him . one of the greatest . it is a classic . it is raw and contemporary . his piano skill are amazing get this one you will not be disappointed
0	i did not realize that i had this song available to me until i saw it in the list of item that i supposedly bought and then when i read the other review and found out it is a free download i decided to listen to it . i listened for about 20 second , clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is . yes , that is why it is free !
0	did not order , do not know why it is showing up on my account .
0	do not appreciate any nudity openly on amazon
1	this is ideal music for easy listening . it play well a background , or for intent listening . eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well . her song are well-chosen & have depth & meaning . fortunately , she doe not try to showcase her entire range in each song , like some other talented singer such a celine dion , whitney houston & mariah carey . this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening . she outshines almost all other female vocalist .
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
1	10 year is one of my favorite band . you can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work . while i still prefer autumn effect , this album is solid , but that is not surprising at all . i really do not think 10 year is capable of producing crap . their music and the vocal are just too good . : )
1	great song from a great band that will no doubt turn out many more terrific song in the future . so far demon is my favorite song from this group .
0	terrible sound quality ! i bought the vinyl and i barely even recognized the song because it wa so warped . dont buy the vinyl version . even worse , i missed the return date . i am stuck with it .
0	misleading name- the name of this song should be changed . putting ( basement tape ) on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version . a real disappointment when looking for the popular version .
0	not happy with this one , do not know if it wa my fault or not but after the download the song disappeared into the bowel of my computer and i still can not find it .
1	how could you go wrong with live zepp at any price !
1	best alternative/pop-rock album of the last time . best parallel project by matt berninger of the national , and brent knopf of menomena .
0	everything about this album is just bad . from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting . it is terrible . ok , let u start it with the obvious . how do they forget the ya-yas version of midnight rambler again ! ? hell , even the album version would be acceptable . that song is undeniably a stone classic , in every single sense of the word . it wa bad enough to miss it on 40 lick , but it omission here is indefensible . that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it .
0	this wa a free download for amazon cloud . the voice were not very good . i could see the supposedly funny side but wa not impressed ! i got le than what free should be !
1	k. 482 is the most visionary , musically-expressively complex , and difficult-to-bring-off of mozart piano concerto , a true concerto for wind instrument , piano and orchestra . fischer , a conductor , extract unusually well-balanced , articulate , expressive performance from this minor orchestra ( in itself a remarkable feat ) , while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work . some might question whether this is mozart-styled performance ; no , but it should be .
0	it s scratched and my fault that i am too late to return it , the cut off date wa oct. 18. we were gone for 3 week and 2 that were in a row . if i can still return it , please let me know , a i would certainly change my review . josh groban is wonderful .
1	can not go wrong with lauren daigle , she ha s an anointing on her
1	man i wish i wa on the us missouri when cher wa there getting her sing on
1	sarah mclachlan ha such a beautiful voice . make it sound a if an angel is singing the song . one of many tremendous song released by sarah mclachlan .
0	i bought this thinking since it her first christmas cd . i wa very disappointed . her range of voice ha changed a lot . she sound nasally and scream a lot in some of the selection . terrible !
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . the amazon downloader would not allow a second try . i asked for and received a refund .
1	another one of that amazon had a a sampler when i got it . i have enjoyed listening to this countless time . i also recommend the 2013 version .
1	best version of one of my favorite song that i have ever heard . watch it with video on youtube to take in the whole scenario , visually stunning a well a a joy to listen to .
0	i have always thought that the best of bon jovi wa richie sambora a he show u in his two previous job . but on this album i see the worst of the song of bon jovis last album . on the other hand , the sound of this cd is very noisy , like the style of some album of the 70 . in short , and for not doing more blood , this cd can be summarized a a couple of good song from a handful of bad and noisy song .
1	thanks for getting it to me on time and a described . got ta love doing this dance !
1	absolutely love it . one of my favorite song at the moment .
0	i do not have this song on my music and i did not order this song must take charge off. ? and hate to write such lengthy review
1	it sound great and the price wa right
0	well if this is the best massive attack album , then i will not be buying any more . nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop imo . this is way overrated ! i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day , yet i listened to and loved portishead , hooverphonic , morcheeba , sneaker pimp becoming x , etc . there are a few good track , but for the most part , it is a mish-mash . maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length .
0	ok , skeptical a i wa , i gave it a try for a long a i can stand it , and after two semester of daily listening while doing homework and studying , this music ha done nothing for me .
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer . i have no idea what happened but this a well a many others wa never downloaded and i didnt want to do it again and pay more money for somehing i already paid for .
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son-in-law a a joke . because it is . all the 4 & 5 star review crack me up ! especially the one from the holier-than-thou hard core dylan fan . particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it . lolololol ! the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself . the 5 star review are so serious ! unbelievable . ( same thing on itunes- if you want some great entertainment , read the review there for both camp .
1	i wa so happy to find this song for kindle fire . it downloaded easily into my itunes . absolutely love it .
1	this cd is so relaxing when i am drifting off to sleep . rain is my favorite nature sound , so you can imagine how often i use this cd . the sound quality is exceptional . i could not be happier !
1	can you wait , love this song . have been waiting on this cd to come out for a long time . worth the wait .
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r & b music . scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam . tank music in the past ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd . the great thing is he did not try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound , he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate . for the lady . tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u !
1	personally , i liked the original version of the song from the movie , but i love this version best !
0	i cd di questi gruppi r & b sono tutti uguali - the same old story
0	volume is low when put in a mall radio .
0	the beat is choppy over typical 80 rythym . you get the feeling of a james bond film . i think i did hear it @ the beginning of a james bond film . i always thought duran duran wa from england .
1	typical hank williams , jr. modern country with a serious message . make me proud to be an american .
0	ok , so it ultra new age and designed for meditation , etc . it still doe not work for me but that may be just personal .
1	this is the music from the opening scene of the movie , layer cake , wherein daniel craig play a fascinating , vulnerable role a a middle man for a recreational medication group in the uk . interesting concept for a movie , and the music grab your attention , also .
1	this should be an international anthem for the million who resist the 9 to 5. or the answer to the life long question . where do i fit in ? leave it to los lobos to put this worrisome question to a foot tapping celebration ala zydeco blue . all i can say is bon temp roule !
1	love the music ! great interesting , sound well
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version . definitely not disappointed with this pressing , first off it is heavy , it feel even heavier than 180 gram . the mastering also seems pretty good , drum are tight and high are bright , the saxophone especially shine . the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone . my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp , they were not .
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine . purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his 1967 basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t-bone burnett , an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of 1975-6. nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the 1970s . rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept .
0	i ordered this twice and both time the record would skip , like it wa warped . it did not look like there were any scratch .
0	beautiful , timeless love song ! delight in the magic of enduring love and devotion with these 74 romantic ballad performed by the legendary star that made them famous . dim the light , then fall in love all over again with . rose are red ( my love ) , bobby vinton * i will always love you , dolly parton * endless love , lionel ritchie with diana ross * when a man love a woman , michael bolton * always on my mind , willie nelson * you are so beautiful , joe cocker * crazy , patsy cline * candle in the wind , elton john * song by original artist : disc .
1	this is a very nice rendition of this song . many different version of this song but so far this is probably my favorite version .
0	i wa looking for strictly disney song to be played by string , no singing . the music sample clip are mis-leading because the song color of the wind , a whole new world and beauty and the beast all had terrible singer singing along . i do not understand why it is 101 string ochestra and then singing for a few of the song . it feel like there were some singer that loved these song and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental .
1	this cd ha made it possible for me to breathe easily for the first time it year . kudos to mr fredricksen for bringing buteykos method to light !
0	i wa hoping for something better than this . i have been reading all the rave review and wondering if amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest . my first impression wa , sale of the 7 string must be down . time to over use it again . i love , love , love vai . i do not love story of light . i can not even give a coherent explanation why at this point . i made it through the first listen and wa thankful that i only spent the money on the download .
1	good oldie classic rock song from the 80
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr .
1	this is one of my favorite old school christmas song . this is a classic .
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect , it is better than that . it is world guitar music . it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when you are awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep .
0	well , keysha cole is a well loved and respected artist , however , if you like her cd then you will love the real woman to woman which is a book dedicated to woman from all walk of life . this is not a book to shove religion down anyones throat , it is a book of encouragement and strategy for the everyday woman to conquer everyday problems/issues woman face . here is the link & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/woman-to-woman-spiritual-strategies-for-the-everyday-woman/dp/1484096304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song . this one is a great example
1	i love hawaiian music . i used to own two hawaiian cd but never really liked them . this cd is incredible and i will always listen to the song when i am on the beach .
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill , over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part , not a high point in an illustrious career .
0	this particular sky record digital album is being sold without jarboes approval . do not support this particular download .
0	should have been edited version it seemed what i wa purchasing great artist loved blurred line without the ugliness , make sure purchaser know what there buying , i gave it away
1	this wa one of my favorite song from the 60 . i have been putting together a playlist of all my favorite 60 song and this one had to be included .
0	i really thought this album wa going to be a game changer . boy wa i wrong . i feel like this is a boring album . i only enjoyed a few song such a medicated and the plan . rolling paper had a couple song i love and still listen to on a regular basis ( when i am gone & camera ) . this album could have been so much more . all the hype and the push back for such an average album
1	i have enjoyed buying music for my kindle because i have found all my oldie but goody . sound quality is excellent .
0	this guy is terrific . however , this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content . every song on one is on the other in the exact order . and i bought both thinking they would be different . really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title . great performer . probably a decent guy . but let u take one of those off the market ! it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky .
0	not impressed the tune the beat and the voice not good for me do not know what could of been better
0	great cd , but the person i sent it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it . very disappointing .
1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl . have not tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly .
1	it is weird and kinda creepy , but i love it .
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released [ 1972 ] . do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo [ which i also highly recommend ] , but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and , a always with malo , there is an ensemble of latin percussion . each of the six long track provides intense listening , if you can manage to sit still that is , many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement .
1	mc flepp ( roman flepp ) from liricas analas rap in romansh ( sursilvan ? ) and graubnden swiss-german . i am not a romansh speaker . i will say i am a student of german so i find it really cool whenever i can make out small bit of the swiss-german : ) . i think romansh is a very lovely , musical language , very pleasing to the ear , and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue . the beat are planned really well , flepp ha a voice that ( imho ) is perfect for his music , and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility .
1	good sound quality and memory ! love journey song .
0	do not expect too much . however , she wa somewhat better than others i have heard . wa okay , but disappointing . so-so client
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp3 or cd . i like the mp3 option since many cd ( album ) only contain a couple keepworthy song .
1	what else can i say ? another great album by a great artist . like another review it different than his last album but just a good all the same . i highly recommend this album .
1	great song i am not that much into country but might be changing , ( not all the way , but will checking out ) love the song
1	at first i thought this wa a keith urban but i wa surprised that it wa jason mraz , but i still love it .
1	michael john poirier ha a soothing voice that match his sublime lyric . i love two song on this album especially : forgiven and the maiden and the messenger . forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who ha an angelic voice . i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger . michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it , asking what i thought of the song . i loved it the first time i heard it and have loved it ever since .
0	only one song on a cd music wonderful i wa looking for more music . at that price offering cd should be full very disappointing
1	i have followed lea since she first appeared on glee . she ha a voice that so powerful . and i am happy to see her career continues to climb .
1	phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio , jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum , along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga , and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans . all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well . jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd .
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever heard . a must for those who collect this type music .
0	i know i should have read the information closer so my fault but - there is only one song on this cd - one song . i wa hoping to hear more from this talented artist . i wa so disappointed .
0	you can buy a cd same price with 73 track on it .so if you have not got that .then do not buy this nokia site a the album on download
1	i think it a different side of beyonce , i feel she is confessing her love for jay z and how they compliment each other by saying that she isdrunk in love , great record and very sexy video
0	a of this writing , many of the track on this album are misnumbered/mislabled .
1	we lost this wonderful country singer way too young . his song calm the soul and lift your spirit . he will be missed .
0	those that have followed grace and the noc , this is a disappointment . grace is much to talented a songwriter for this . this is an artist like picaso doing a paint by number . if you liked never going back v song with meaning like apology or big white gate , this is for you . gone are song with meaning , soul , truth , blue , replaced by techno . i ms the guitar riff between scott and benny . i miss a piano solo like star . i miss a rocker like ah mary or stop the bus .
1	love it . hate it . it is going to live on a one of the greatest album of all time . forever remembered a the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music wa , ( some of u knew . it wa called the underground scene ) i mean let face it , if anyone remembers 1991 ( and i do not mean being 8 ) you know that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away . mainstream rock wasnt supposed to be that good . not at that time anyways . it changed the mainstream .
1	fun music . make you feel lighthearted and free . and it wa free . music ha a mix of jazzy , to indie to rap .
1	i remembered this song one day . and began researching it online . my flate ather once owned the vinyl record . he frequently played different genre of music music around the house . i grew up loving all kind of music . i have not heard this song since childhood . the vinyl record of course is lost now . this digital song wa sung by much the same/similar original artist i would listened to growing up . it brought back wonderful memory of happy childhood day .
1	great price ! product a stated ! no problem !
0	i only heard 1 song off the album but sometimes i wait i do not want something i cant give back , i like to give but i do not want to give back better save your money , i heard a song i did not like , i only heard 1 song off the album , better save your money
0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never came out you think a track featuring garry shider , skeet curtis , and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier .
0	the instrumentation is amazing , the vocal are very good but when i first heard the lyric i just thought wtf . this ha got to be a joke . why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song . i wa extremely let down . it still give me hope for the sound of this upcoming album . if the lyric were any better this would be one the most badass song ever .
0	i love dyan . this cd came a a shock . slow , boring , uninspired , dreadful . update , i listened to it again . it is even worse than i thought . his singing is like a parody ; it is amateurish ; he would be laughed off the stage at american idol . horrible ! i can not believe he released this .
0	not traditional music , very synthesized new native music - not what i wa expecting .
0	alright , this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review . it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a 5 year old most likely did . the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not know ! that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first 3 time . the final you do not know ! end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer . do not throw away your money , and if it is on the radio change the station !
0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol . i had heard this song on the radio ( probably too much ? ) and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today . i have to say i like the song , but the ending is really [ . ] . of course now given the whole chris brown thing it make me feel disgusted about him in general , but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability .
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	i can not figure out why this song wa so popular in the first place ? only thing i can tell you is stay away from this one . worst song in the 90 period .
0	the album is great . the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa made for crosley , and sound like isht . oh well , at least it look cool in white
0	i pre ordered this record , so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived . i wa all but kissed the delivery man when it came ! i ran straight up to my record machine and played it , probably around 3 time before giving poor dierks a break . i listened to the record about 5 time after that before the unthinkable happened . it is different for girl began to skip ! i wa in shamble ! on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite record it wa skipping !
1	my second favorite r & b album of the year , right behind anti from riri . this wa a grower at first but it is bumpin loud around the house now . it wa hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all i kept playing wa welcome to my world ! { we in this bitch } hold on ! { another great hip hop an r & b tracc for u best of me fan } an elevator . the rest of the album is great like team you ! coolin ! & smoove jones afta glow show ! { outro } but one man woman is weak .
1	wow ! these guy just get better and better and they work together so very well beautiful irish sound sing on
1	this is a awesome cd . full of cruchy guitar , dual solo , thumping bass and pounding drum . everything tou would expect from stryper and more !
0	ooh , an electronica pop christmas song ! no , wait . it is another lady gaga song about sex where she turn everything into innuendo . guess what the christmas tree is . yep . at least it wa free and i did not waste any money on it .
1	i really like the song , but it wa the toyota commercial she wa in , with the song , that had me . this is the first kelly clarkson song i have bought . look forward to trying more of her style of music . she doe sing the national anthem very well too . thanks !
1	fun , upbeat song to put you in a good mood and make you want to dance .
0	i downloaded this and it start over in the middle of the download a bad one this one and it still cost me so watch when getting this song !
0	home for christmas . sound innocent enough . but you would be well advised to stay away from this home . it is a horrible place . you will be asking santa for some ear plug if you purchase this cd . alternately , you can buy it for people on your christmas list that you do not like or just plain hate . how bad is it ? some say that the cia used it to torture hardened terrorist suspect in guantanamo . it had them babbling like baby in minute . but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland , go ahead and buy it if you must .
0	used a directed and noticed no change in behavor , my food shopping did not change , eating did not change . but will keep using to see if there will be any change .
1	while the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few track took me back to dylan juda moment , i still recommend this wonderful series . my baby fell asleep within 20 minute of first firing it up , and hopefully ha planted some subliminal love for the pixy to share with me in the future . the stone one is good too . but mike , please remove the electric from monkey go to heaven , for u purist .
0	most song on this album are too similar . i only enjoyed 2 song . not the best album i have bought in a while . i do like sinach , and wa quite disappointed with this one .
0	dear sir or madam , i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd . however , it must be good to use the right half of our brain , which is usually not used .
0	what is wrong with record company these day ? everytime you turn around there is yet another greatest hit , ultimate , essential , box set or whatever hit package that basically consist of all the same song , give or take one or two exception . this hit package is no different . amy fan , you already have all this - there is no need to buy it . what is up with amy anyway ? what audience is she trying to speak to ? her old christian audience , pop audience , adult comtemporaray audience , all of them ?
1	wa a gift for a friend a and he love it
1	great song . the live version i think is better an the album version . i do not think this song got played alot .
1	it is a song , you either like it or you do not . i like it and therefore am recommending it to you . : )
0	while i am a berlin fan , i wanted to go back while listening to these song in the car . i should have read closely - these are not the original . while the are good , they are not the same . time to replace/repurchase with the original .
1	i found this binaural suggestion online and have been able to get to sleep much more easilywith this in the background .
0	. some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because , foolishly like me , you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago , but you get to listen to the composition of : 1- dannay orton , 2- blair daly , 3- greg barnbill , 4- dennis matkosky , 5- chas sandford , 6- jay demarcus , 7- brett james , 8- george hawkins jr. , 9- marcus hummon , who are not in the band . with only 1 song ( out of 12 ) written entirely by a band member , apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so .
1	i have been looking for some inspiration today , and i found it online at amazon .
1	jerry playing wring so much feeling out of every note , and everything he play is so tasteful and rich . yum .
0	sad sad album ! a an old fan of marilyn mccoo i jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release . to my deception ! the album is a collection of old hit produced like it wa recorded in a lobby of a 2 star hotel ! they both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though marilyn mccoo still keep her perfect and crystal clear english . the highlight of this album is her reedition of bacharahs this girl in love with you . there are two extra dowloadable song that only god know how it work to get it !
1	you know , i am just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the difference from original to remastered . but i will say , paying $ 60 ( or $ 70 or $ 80 ) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous . i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fan ; i became aware during the born in the usa tour , then purchased all the previous cassette . so , in the last 28 year , cassette were lost and/or became obsolete . now i am able to purchase all seven for what amount to $ 8 .
0	love greg , hate this song . own 40 to 50 this one should never been recorded . should return it , but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button . lousum
0	this album suck . like the other 1 star reviewer wrote , it is all commercial radio garbage . it is so overproduced , it is hard to listen to . i have been listening to the band since the late 90 and if you want to hear good o.a.r . you have to see them live or buy their first live cd . if you like this album , you are probably a new o.a.r . fan , or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 album back . which is not a criticism , but for people who remember them when they first started , their change to this is definitely a shock .
0	this is him singing a a younger artist . still have not been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song . still an awesome and tear jerking song though .
0	again amazon.com did not download my purchase . this is not the first time but it is the reason i do not keep or alow amazon.com software or cooky on my computer . amazon.com ha used them to erase kindle book . that wa the greatest act of malicious malware i have ever come across . so now i eliminate all software , ie , the amazon.com music player , and the amazon.com cooky both of which were use in the malware attack on my kindle library . when amazon .
0	i really do not appreciate amazon not allowing u to use our reward dollar available on our credit card when we buy mp3s . i do not accrue that many reward credit on my credit card , it would be much more fair if we could use those towards mp3 purchase .
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
0	i did not enjoy this album a much a the previous album .
0	i expected more musical growth from the band .
0	sound like it wa recorded during tuesday night music club ( i know it wasnt ) and that is not my favorite era of hers . sound sorta been-there-done-that . hope the rest of the detour cd is better .
1	i just finished watching philadelphia . the movie-one of the most moving ( and sad ) movie i have ever seen . not a dry eye in the house with this one ! the song ( neil young ) - perhaps one of the most beautiful and pensive love song i have ever heard . i want to own that song ( not necessarily the entire soundtrack ) .
1	one of my son really wanted this song and think it is 5 star for sure !
1	good song , love her voice , love the beat put me in a good mood , i downloaded immediately after i heard the song on the radio .
0	where is the banjo ? where is the awesome make me live music ? there is not one song on this album that compare to anything or any one song you have done in the past . whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong . do what you love , not what other people want . this is definitely not what i expected . i just got this today , on your release day and could not skip through it fast enough . very disappointed .
0	this is not the rengades . i am very disappointed . it seems that all the renegade mp3 downloads have the original title but are not the song belonging to that title .
0	no plot synopsis or any information about the production included .
1	terry kath in his heyday jamming over a funky vamp before transitioning into bobby lamms bluesy ballad . loud , raw , and improvisational gibson s-g handiwork make this tune my favorite early chicago piece of work , circa , 1969 .
0	selfies are annoying enough , i do not see why an annoying song wa necessary . the white girl voice in this song is so unbelievably annoying . i want to just smash my headphone . i mean yes , it ha a catchy tune , but it is not the type of song that you spend money on . look up on youtube , watch it once , and then never discus it again .
1	fantastic i love it love it love it , della lift the heart & stir the soul . i start my day with this if at all possible , praise god ! it is best to give your day to the lord , this is the way to do it . i reccommended it highly . jojo
1	now memory run with this a night at a local hotel packed with people and trying to get a drink of course i wa wearing the black dress .
1	critic have called this the best soul album ever . they are right . this is the best non-greatest hit soul album one can buy . outstanding singing , precision producing make this a can not miss album . the album look like a greatest hit package with ghetto child , one of a kind love affair , how could i let you get away , i will be around and others . the first track , just can not get you out of my mind get you going and you will not be able to turn it off .
1	the title say it all , really . i absolutely adore this song . listen to it on you tube and then you will want to buy it too !
0	horrible annoying sound . i disliked this tremendously . i kept hoping the sound would change but wa just the same 10 second sound over and over .
1	my boy favorite song . they sing this to the top of their lung . the youngest say we are fighting the devil when we sing this song nan ! anointed !
1	catchy tune written by an old pro with many good song under his belt . i think it reflects on a career in a very messed up industry .
0	i am not sure what those who gave this 4 or 5 star are thinking . this is awful ! i realize there will always be sycophant of certain band who are so enamored with them they will always rate 5 star when it is painfully obvious 5 star are not in order . this is certainly one of those time . this cd is horrific , and that is being charitable . i love old van halen - they are among my all-time faves . but this ? who , in their right mind , can give this crap 3 star , much le 4 or 5 ?
1	remembered this song from year ago and am very glad to have found it again .
0	not so much . only one or two song i enjoy . too all over the place a far a music go .
0	this is the lowest form of music . it is following a predictable and waning formula . i have listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me . i have listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpet to entertain me .
0	paul taylor music is not the same a when i bought his earlier cd . the music is not a great a it wa before .
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity , which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register , and is a very successful song , most of the track on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song , with vitas singing usually in a middle register . track 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 were co-written by vitas , track 8 , 10 and 11 written by him alone . total playing time is 36:15. i simply adore this cd . it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy , enthusiasm and love .
0	this is not music , it a cry for help . oh my gosh this is awful . not worth 1 star .
0	thie album is pretty good , redneck crazy is by far the best song . i would not buy music from amazon again . have to use their player to down load and it is crap . have to pa 25 a year to add your track to it if you have over 250
1	beautiful love song . beautiful voice . i became a johnny hartman fan a a result of hearing this song .
1	i am a little late to join the party when it come to this artist , but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for thinking out loud on youtube ( i did not realize it had been played to death on the radio according to friend ) i love the cd . it is awesome to find an artist that actually play real instrument , writes their own music , with lyric that actually convey human emotion . wonder never cease .
1	our first dance a husband and wife wa to this song . i hope we are dancing to it for year to come .
0	the novelty wear off very quickly . a couple of listens and i wa done with it .
1	it is been a while since i have really listened to tegan and sara , but when in heard i could not be your friend i immediately had to buy the album . i am so glad i did because i had forgotten how much i loved them ! i love this album - it is a bit different than what their old stuff wa like , but it is still awesome !
0	i really expected to be blown away by this album . it wa one of the best selling record the year it came out , and this record cemented lil wayne a one of the biggest rapper on the planet . you could not turn the tv on without seeing him or this record . however , there were only 3 or so song that i liked . the other song just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me . this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyric , but maybe the producing .
0	not the same sound a the original version . sound like a different singer ! yuck .
0	the tune wa a repeat of past have fun teaching song and too advance for my 4/5 year old . i am able to a adjust most of three other song i have purchased . the other song like water cycle were great
0	very disappointed in this version and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song
0	this recent purchase wa resold for a couple dollar ! it is virtually all noise . the vocal by mick jagger are ragged and imo there is not a single good song among . the lot .
0	i do not normally give a poor review . i am more likely to lean toward average or better . the product is fine . play well , no issue at all . the problem i have is that i did not get it for over 24 hour . i think today you should be able to purchase a song on-line and be able to play it then and there . i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting . i will not buy music from amazon anymore . but i will still buy everything else !
0	this review is directed at the vendor a opposed to the actual album . do not buy from new chapter recycling , this record shipped in a plain white cover ( and damaged at that ! ) instead of the original cover a seen in the pic . ridiculous , sending back and ordering from another vendor .
0	i bought this for my brother , and wa dumb enough to listen to it before i gave it too him . i have heard a thousand country song that say the same thing , just with different word . somebody stole my truck , some guy ran off with my girlfriend , somebody shot my dog , and i am too drunk to do anything about any of it . do not waste your time and money . just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little . you will get the same result .
0	would it kill amazon to get the original version of this song ? this remix is pure dreck , avoid like the plague .
0	i hate you i hate you i hate you . i had a credit and i tried to use it for two song . they got sent to 2 different folder . now it say the download took too long . and i lost my $ and the song . you stink , amazon . make it easier to spend my own damn money . thanks .
0	i bought album for some old favorite i remember . the playlist list the correct song title but the song that play is different . most song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite ( when irish eye are smiling , who put the overalls. , macnamaras band , etc ) were not really what played . very strange but a waste of money .
0	this cd ha a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining ! very depressing ! her voice crack , scrape and she can not quite hit the note . buy bonnie raitt instead .
1	my 3.5 year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable-channel music station . it is now a frequent player . he here is dozen of song a day , but this one wa a sticky one .
0	my mother and i absolutely love josh groban and this song . but we were very disappointed when it only played the first verse and the chorus like five more time . very disappointing rendition
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off . i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude . but come on people . by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space . to leave track such a take it away/ballroom dancing/tug of war/c moon/vanilla sky/helen wheels/bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable .
0	not what i expected . not my type of music but it wa free .
1	this brings me back to my younger year - my college day when ll wa still my boo : - ) i have grown up since then but i still love this song .
1	a fun and lovely song to sing along to . i bought this version to play in the car for the little one . this is a classic must for child !
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song . first , there is the music : the song is fairly simply , yet build in a mid-80s era bob dylan style . nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song . the production is clean , with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal , exactly where is should be . the primary focus of the song is in the lyric . wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road , and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it .
1	my favorite version of the ave maria ! i particularly like that there is not a lot of vibrato . so happy amazon ha this !
0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival , and loved every single song . based on that , i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it . after hearing these song , i definitely will not be purchasing this album . the girl are definitely beautiful , all right . it is easy to see why they are so well-loved because of it . but on this album , their voice have not matured enough to enjoy listening to , no matter how pretty they are .
1	gorgeous music that go through your soul !
0	another overrated band to grace the late night tv airwave . they do not have much to back up their late night acclaim though . notable song are lacking , this album sound like a kid garage arrangement on some home computer .
1	love this cd ! the message is great and the music make you want to dance ! this particular song ( beautiful ) is a song every person , especially young woman , should hear and heed .
0	awful . doe not sound right at all . i would love my.money back if i could figure out how
0	this track doe not work ! played once and that wa it ! gave one star because i received a prompt refund . hope this help .
0	there wa not enough info to convert file for play on win medium player . could not find file on my computer
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood . the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song . it got so low at time i could not really make out the note . but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song . all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little , the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell .
0	i have been a fan of heart since 1976 but i must say this album is a stinker . i thought the sister wilson wanted to rock on this record . sorry . but i aint hearing it here .
0	oops , bought by mistake . do not waste your money
1	i wa at these show . to have a physical piece of history that i wa apart of is priceless . y & t never fails to put on a phenomenal show . they sound a good today a when i saw them in 85 .
0	this is a very average song and cook scream in some place instead of singing . hard to believe that chris cornell wrote it .
1	i love this song . the melody and musicianship are great . i listen to this song when i lift weight and in the morning a i am getting ready for work .
1	i have hundred of xmas , am a dylan fan & read all the review here & wanted to add i love this cd . i agree with all the detail in the 5 star review & will not repeat them , but what stand out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangement here . it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & dylan raspy voice add the spice & crackling of the log . for me , this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra , manilow or bing . unlike other big name star who make the obvious xmas collection , dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over & over .
0	this is cute but very small . do not think it is worth the price . it is very soft . doe not seem to keep kid intrigued
1	even if you do not dance , you can not help but move to this music .
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five star im not sure if they are real people or work for three door down
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
0	i think it is a shame that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echo of eternity . this is by far the worst cd i have gotten in a long time , and the first that made me write a review . the singer may be the worst i have ever heard . even my cat cd sound better . i am very bitter about the $ 15 i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music .
1	excelent damn donna u did it again u came through with a very empowering and inspirational song without being cheesy or to religious something i needed at this point in my life thank you i love you a life long fan
1	ahhh ! that sweet voice of anne murray , this lady pours her heart in to all of her song , an extremely pleasing voice for your listening pleasure , buy it youll be glad you did .
1	this might be the best product big bad voodoo daddy ha ever released . every song is fantastic . in this cd they mixed new orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that , though it is clearly big bad voodoo daddy , give it a fresh sound . the lyric are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful . in addition , the duet it only took a kiss is gorgeous . i had vision of fred astaire and ginger rogers dancing during it .
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample . very good , i enjoyed most every song , except carried by the wind . when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier , a if i would heard it before . i listened a few more time , and yes , i had heard it before . it is a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album ! i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song !
0	prime music is worthless . i am not renewing next year since i can not download prime song for free to my computer . i paid for this , tutorial say you can download song to your pc , but your s * app will not let me . and on top of this , i hate this song .
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to . this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel . this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix . some of the song are downright painful to listen to , but they are still fascinating to listen to . most of the music in this album come from their first few collection , such a shadow and nightmare , ash , and dynasty . there is a much , much darker , evil , grating sound .
1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented . a breath of fresh air !
0	another balcony sacrifice . they should be ashamed of themselves
0	they play this song so many time when this came out and gosh will he ever go away ? he is overrated and need to work at mcdonalds cause no one lovin it .
1	iv been collecting mucic for over 53 year and let me tell you that this 2 cd super rock . this is one cd i am proud to have in my collection !
1	great music ! loved it ! thanks a lot !
1	california love the greatest song of all time why everybody go to cali it is mostly the west coast , a for me florida is almost like california , i live in orlando which is mostly part of central florida . especially all part around the sunshine state .
1	a far a i am concerned there is no other choir that can stand up to this one . i you have ever never heard the star spanged banner sung by them it would be well worth your time to find it . p.s . i am not a mormon .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyrically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am biased that way .
1	this is some good music , right here ! larue is a vocal beast . i had the pleasure of being at the live recording and i wa blown away with her vocal , the background vocal and the band . everything wa on point . the music a easy to follow and i did not feel cheated when it came to ministry . although it wa the recording for her cd , she still stayed with the ministry element and tear were flowing , hand were praised , and praise were being given to the father .
1	great shipping time ! product a described .
1	exceptional drop of passion resonate with clarity , depth , and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song aint no mountain high enough ; sung with assured perfection by diana ross ; brilliantly written by nickolas ashford & valerie simpson . we soar through the cloud with this flawless rendition . we are lost in it lyrical poetry . we are captured by ross genteel and unique voicing , inflection , and intonation ; she set the stage for listener - in her directness & sincerity .
1	carol of the bell is my favorite christmas song but with so many artist doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood . i think this version doe a very good job in that .
1	being a band nerd , i like listening to band music . this compilation is first rate , and i hope that student will ask their director to program on or more of these selection for an upcoming concert or festival . i hope director will take the time to listen and say to themselves yeah , my band can play this ! i first heard of stephen melillos music a a college student . i wa selected to play in the kkpsi/tbs national intercollegiate band in 1993 , and we performed his a walk in jurassic park .
0	im not sure if i like it or not - i finally listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following 5 song : trust in you , enough , empty me , i wait for the lord and revive me . not even the chainsmokers . weird . the cd case and the artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers : bouquet . none of the music is chainsmokers . again weird !
0	thought the artist were the original singer . they were community theatre caliber . ok , but off broadway . best song from the best musical , but not the best singer . come on man !
1	this song brings back memory of my teenage year . i love most of their music anyway . they sure can sing !
1	this product is simply a recorded countdown for each 20 second interval of exercise and 10 second of rest for a total of 8 cycle .
0	i am a huge stevie fan , and this one wa rather disappointing . i actually bought 2 of these , one for me , and one for a friend of mine . the friend listened to it first and said not the best work i have heard from her , but thanks for the cd ! so on a long road trip , i played mine . boo ! so disappointed . possible 2 song at best were steve quality , the rest were rather well , boring . sorry stevie . : (
1	love this and keep it on my kindle and play over and over again . have this on a cd also in my car . quite beautiful !
1	liz ha had a rough couple of year . with that being said , she ha come out the other side stronger than ever . with more of a blues/rock sound and hard living lyric exodus of venus is her best work to date .
1	posiblemente la cancin m famosa de don omar , el cantante bein conocido . hay que comprarlo ; esta versin e impresionante . el mejor de la versiones hoy .
0	pretentious , bombastic and utterly devoid of charm , this is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge . this is truly one of the worst album i have ever heard .
0	not a energetic a other version . i wa expecting a little bit more . might be fine for background music etc , but not the song i wa looking for
0	i do not understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today . he is a cut above in the vocal department - he doe not need to do this . i am not a fan of his song selection and the direction he is gone in his career , with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock , where he shine , in my opinion . but , i adore him and his fearlessness . he is obviously doing what he love and just because it doe not resonate with me doe not mean it is not worthwhile .
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i did not do my research . i give this album a 2 because it ha a couple new track , but there are only 7 and most are from his free mixtape . you can get his mixtape so far gone for free , online which ha 17 track and is a lot better . it ha good track flow , great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape . i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity .
0	it hurt to listen to the lp version . this should be erased from existence . the real song is not available in the itunes store usa only the uk itunes store .
1	the majestic song dead or alive open this 1981 album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides , jim goodwin , peter muny & robert medici . alone worth the price of the album , this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet line of john gatchell . a live version with a significantly different feel appears on & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/comes-alive/dp/b001ijz188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?
1	i use to hear that song without knowing the title . i finally found it and i am enjoying it . thanks to amazon for making purchase so easy and good quality music .
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick !
1	this a great cd by two great artist . it is pure country , both vocal and the music are outstanding .
1	nice ! i play it when cleaning up the house ! nice blend of music ! some folk can relate to what i am talking about . : )
0	never heard this version before ! would have been nice to have been nice if l had been made aware that there wa various artist . this is not even the guy who wrote the song ( cohn ? or cohen ? ) even though llove the song l had to delete this version immediately ! waste of money
1	great to listen to . for my daughter and the lesson through life . also smash mouth get knocked down but i get back up again !
1	this is a song that will probably be one that is an all time hit . i love everything about it .
0	garbage . joe derosa is not a funny man .
0	i wa counting down the day to this album being released . i listen to sturgills first two album often and could not wait for new stuff . so i buy the album on release day and start listening . what the heck is this ? ! ? ! the 1st track is ok , the nirvana cover is absolutely putrid , the rest of the album is just boring and generic . huge disappointment !
1	this song give me so much inspiration whenever i need it . yolanda adam is one of the most talented and blessed gospel artist today .
0	when i purchased this product it would not download . i could get no help from amazon . it wasnt worth pursuing it for 99 cent .
1	promise made on signal mountain ha to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . this entire cd is so calming ; i can not explain the sense of peace that come over me when i listen to it . if you are looking for something relaxing and uplifting , i would highly recommend it !
1	a great follow-up to her award winning duet with jason aldean and her tv show duet , kelly sings with famed country artist vince gill to create a truly lovely song . it is well sung and it keep running through my head . it is one of those hear it one time and know you will buy it song imho . enjoy !
0	strong political view that are ranted about through the medium . refuse to listen to it a second time .
0	this wa a gift for a friend , i never listened to it , but she loved the music .
0	aint nothing like 2 crackheads in love brings back memory doe not it remember when they both hooked up cocaine wa indeed a hell of a drug .
0	a many people may know by now , sony wa recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased cd ( van zant : get right with the man ) from sony music not only installed drm software ( digital right management , to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain device ) , but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from window , and opened the system up to security issue such a virus .
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately , and not for her music . it ha been for her work with american idol , and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split . but for her latest single , she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before , and fails to do it on papi , the third single from her album love ? the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career .
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable . his second album wa the best - he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song . the material is weak and the lyric are laughable . this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star . he wa never that - his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word . his interpretation of classic on american idol ( mad world , track of my tear ) , made the song his own .
0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review . east . 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac wack . that is blasphemy right there . he wa a real a it get , he had quite a few positive song , and he wa one of the greatest ! anyone would agree with me there . on to my review of this cd . i weep at the current state of hip hop . how did we go from notorious big to lil flip ? hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it is pathetic .
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want .
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i am all for freedom of speech , but this song is just shock value . not impressed .
0	very poor album . there is a lacking of instrument , basic drum . very unsophisticated .
1	this album ha me rocking out to favorite track like carry me back and levi while also cooling down with bob dylan-esque track including aint it enough and the way of man . overall all the banjo and fiddle romp leave me yearning for a blue grass festival .
0	the cd did not play . i purchased volume 1 and volume 2 but volume 2 doe not play and the paper and receipt were not saved . highly disappointed .
1	meek mill traumatized hit too close to home a i have recently lost my mother and took over her position . polo and shell top also meant a lot to me .
1	if you like blue and you like rock , this is your ticket . not only can joe play some awesome guitar , he is also got a great voice to go along with it . i just now discovered joe and am in love with his music ( my wife is too ) . great guitar , great singing , great beat , great band . what more can you ask for ? if his other work is a good a this , then i will end up owning every cd he ha . seriously , if you do not like this cd and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor .
0	this album is horrible . the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job , but david lee roth should be put out to pasture . i can not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance . problem : 1. david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa 1978. a such , he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly . 2. he only sings half of the lyric , the rest are spoken . 3. he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric .
0	worse song ever , with all of her success and talent and this is what she creates ? get a life .
1	bought this one when it wa new . a great double album of a neglected band . just listen to budd johnson for a start . the great drummer alvin burroughs , shorty baker and the young mr. b , are also on hand . grab it quickly .
0	came in distorted could not even hear it
1	i did not grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly african american church that i grew up in but listening to it now make me wish i heard stuff like this earlier . beautiful lyric and it is all lifting up the name of jesus christ .
1	i first heard this song while watching the movie , tha naked gun starring leslie nielson . i like it !
1	i have chosen this song to be played at my funeral upon my passing . i love the old fashioned hymn and patriotic music .
0	i heard this song in my church and the band wa great . it wa soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version .
0	i wa told this wa happy music . i find it boring & depressing . i am tossing it .
1	a very strong set of song , both lyrically and melodically . and robin is in good voice throughout .
1	only ha a 7 song but i love them all he sound just like he did when i fell in love with him on sunday best . it is nice to hear a nice young fresh and new voice singing the word of god they could not have picked a better title for the album it wa well done and i have been waiting for it most of the song he performed on sunday best are on here tracklist 1.god in me- joshua put his youth flava and some gospel hiphop singing the mary mary hit 2 .
0	i wa watching a bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought i wa watching snl . i had to listen to it later because it seemed so bad . it is horrible . next song will be blue solo cup . then motor oil . then oral-b toothbrush . this is the promotional song for the album . how bad are the other song ?
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
1	it wa just what i wonted to the t. the sound wa great and the price wa ok . wish it wa buy one get one .
0	ok , jason moran is a piano virtuoso . if you still did not know , this is a reason to listen to this work . the problem come when you are looking for something else . this album is a jazz trio , but what about the other two ? well , overshadowed by the soloist . although better that way , and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise : the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed . to top it off , the theme included in this album are dull and flat .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient .
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the 3rd felt release ! i have only listened to it about 3 time , but my first impression were of disappointment . one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end ; this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed . i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me , but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining .
0	wow . i wa hoping for more like his first 2 album and wa severely disappointed . nirvana . really ? not great listening .
0	not one memorable song.disappointing
1	i just watched the blu-ray of the movie woodstock - it ha the csn & y version at the end of the movie , but jm get a separate credit for writing the song .
1	i can listen to this one over and over again .
0	wile i am sure it is just right for some folk , and i like a lot of cajun & zydeco music , this one just did not do it for me . i actually did not keep it . deleted .
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album . it made a very poor impression then , but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later . this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired : ray manzareks unique , soulful , creative keyboard rendition , robby kriegers classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability , and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band .
1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying , i wanted pretty hate machine - part ii , and the such . anybody who ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he release . you will never get a part ii to any nin album , because , from the beginning , trent reznor set out to do one thing : innovate . rehashing old album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature . ghost , however , pushing trent reznor to his creative edge .
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song . one of mjs best song he did : (
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment !
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him . their review seem a little biased at best . the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music , it doe so in the most generic way possible . nothing here is really worth listening to more than once , and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it .
1	my favorite recording of my favorite classical piece . played by the master himself . it long but worth it . everyone should hear it at least once .
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria , periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world . the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year . the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it is own , albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos . periphery brings enough fresh idea , along with a solid understanding of their root , to craft an album well worth owning .
1	this is a great song . worth having in your collection . fast and easy download . able to sample before you buy . i love this about amazon
1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest , most beautiful cd i have in my collection . buy it without hesitation . indescribably beautiful , intelligent , warm and well produced .
1	amazing work from alt j a always , my favorite song on the album are nara and every other freckle .
0	i purchased this song along with 4 other song and all but this one completed the download . i tried to cancel this song order , but could not . therefore i paid for this song that did not download . no way to try a second time without paying for the song again and taking the chance it will not download again . oh well .
1	maybe this album is not a good a rejoyce , but it is still great , i just love her !
1	amazon make purchasing song really easy and is unmatched in quality when it come to the ease of purchase and the quality of it all .
1	mint condition is an excellent group . they sing song that touch your heart and that you can let your parent or others listen to . the music is wholesome and meaningful .
0	some of these song are so bad they are funny . i kept bandy bandy , by zap mama featuring erykah badu , which is nice . also kept two other track , which i shall not name , but only for my really bad song playlist .
0	could not stomach much of this . slow , lifeless , abomination of the real symphony . depressing .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all .
1	great song is time of need when you need to lifted up . my soul do say yes to the creator of this universe . lord , i thank you and continue to bless brian wilson . this man can sing anything that is family oriented and church .
1	an excellent song ( and prayer ) for every believer ! help me to keep my focus on my heavenly hope . i think most of u long for our heavenly home and to be with our loved one that have gone before u .
1	i like messianic music , so this wa a treat for me . many paul wilbur work , but others a well .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	an awesome pure worship experience that you will want to experience over and over again and never get tired of listening to !
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
0	i enjoy music that clearly tell a story ; the tone is moving and very enjoyable . what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the word that are sung . hopefully artist in the future could follow example ; where music could be music again .
1	this is a very pleasant disc to listen to . excellent arrangement of many standard , each with an excellent combination of voice . well worhgt adding to your collection .
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band . unlike most third wave ska band , they have a clear clean sound . they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal . this is not similar to early ska or the two-tone era ska . it is too peppy and energetic . this album is good clean fun . i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese . there is only one song completely in english . most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english .
0	i am a huge floyd fan . i love everything since dark side , and much from before dark side . i love post-waters floyd , floyd with roger water , and i love a lot of the solo song from water , from gilmour , and from wright . i did not enjoy this album . i heard it once through and that wa enough . i do not think it is a money grab , it just suck . edit : perhaps floyd , or at least those that remain , deserve an album retrospect , in whatever way they desire .
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music . what happened to free ?
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
0	this is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp . it is complete with tic and pop . the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo part of the recording . i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape and wa very disgusted with the sound . my worn cassette copy wa much better . i would give it a zero for the rating if i could . the performance is wonderful and exciting , but badly mangled by the transfer . do not buy this under any circumstance .
1	i am so in love with this song . clay vocal surpass in this beautifully written song . if you have not bought it yet , go buy it . you will love it also !
1	a great album . i am now a great new fan .
0	a rehash of very old willie . 50 poorly recorded cut of the early year . total disappointment . look for better collection .
0	i had no idea that 9 out of 10 song were not original recording and 5 out of those 9 were flat out horrible . do not waste your money if you want original . i had forgotten how bad k-tell recording were
1	the disc came shortly after i ordered it , and ha been very impressive ever since . this young british maestro definitely ha this score well under his skin . the vienna philharmonic play splendedly , especially the lovely ending in the final movement .
1	i do not know why this song wasnt a bigger hit . it ha always been one of my favorite . it is very evocative .
1	liked it when i wa a kid . cool .her version of michael jackson . almost exact . now i am blown by it . she ha such a way about her . no wonder prince and quincy jones and whitney houston and all the rest admire her talent .
1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska , i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy . i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were . in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention . in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a & e special concert promoting the bee gee album , this is where i came in .
1	i love how her music let you create your own imaginative scenario or remember special thing . sometimes no word are necessary and her music allows you to go to a quiet place and not be distracted by lyric and allows you to be with your own thought .
1	fresh worshipper leader that will help you enter into the presence of the lord .
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want . but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade . at least elvis wa able to produce some brilliance in this area , like blue christmas . this is tweedily dumb .
1	i love this song , and amazon make it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dy or something in the middle of the download , all for free . see itunes , if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load , or your power go out , or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again , trust me , i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once .
1	the song is one of roberta flack most memorable song dating back to the seventy when she sang at mr. henry in dc .
0	this song wa absolutely horrible ! it wa very distasteful and lacked structure . i do not recommend this song for anyone . in fact , if every cd nick lowe made exploded , i would not have a problem ! it is terrible . do not buy or get this song ! warning warning do not buy !
0	the song are great , but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back . it it a static-filled , compressed mess and it is pretty hard to listen to . whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album . waiting for the remaster .
0	company wa great . thought it would be more contemporary music . the cd wa to much blue . depressing at best . others may like it .
0	i feel like a traitor saying this , but i will not be buying this set any time soon . i stand second-to-none in my affection for the band , but unfortunately , this career-spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 year of that recording career . by my count , there are only about five song on this set that were released after 1980. not good enough . capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered song , and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads .
0	i wish i could give this 5 star because i really do love the performance on this album . however , the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album . it is a if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone . it sound really thin . that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp3 format , i really can not give it more than 2 star . this performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release .
0	the bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986 , the music wa just a awful a i remembered it . serious hair metal , here . i listened to the whole album through prime music ( thanks , amazon ) and decided that even though this is getting glowing review , stryper just is not for everyone .
0	honestly . i hate this song . i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it . it is another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem . i respect them and really like some of their stuff . ace wa a bos ! . but this is just campy .
1	song wa super . the amazon player is a total pain in the neck . i had problem playing the song with my usual mp3 and wmp program and i just do not want to get any more song from amazon until that problem is non-existent .
0	nothing wrong with ac/dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like 30 year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac/dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind . for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need . well maybe two , if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc . they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet , hit package or live album get boring .
0	she did a song in english so you guy can also understand the meaningless thing she ha to say . and this song is the most meaningless she ever did . but her voice sound much stronger . this is not a typical blmchen-song . there are many backgroungsingers and more lyric . there are three song on this single . the radio version , the extended version and the song where heart have wings.it is the english version of her song herzen haben flgel . i think it is on the blossom-album heartbeat
1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out . it wa really good , but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then . i got this , because i had a $ 1 amazon mp3 credit awarded for a purchased cd . after skimming through a few other artist , i remembered this song and picked it up . the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than the original , which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track .
1	this album is amazing . i have been a tough sell lately on new music - especially on first listen throughs . but i wa instantly hooked . if you like zaba , you will like this . it is different , but in a good way .
1	here come the mummy are wonderful ! their music is exceptional , make you want to get up and move . i have missed this kind of music , it is hard to find now day and it is original . the lyric are also very original . they are funny and full of innuendo . if you ever have a chance to see them in person do not pas it up !
1	great album ! no track on it that i dislike ; every one is worth listening to . the lyric are interesting , the musical style is varied and frankly just sound cool , and it is a nicely long album which i always appreciate . worth every penny .
1	if you like chicago & like christmas music , this is the cd for you .
1	beautifully sung by howard shore ! a great buy .
0	it downloaded twice . i called for credit . they told me they had issued the credit but when i went to use my account again i notice i had not been issued the credit for this item .
1	so very good . he is my favorite singer . wish i did not have to wait for the entire album to come out in april
1	excellent recording . i can not stop listening to this . once i bought this , i got all the other master in this series a well .
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan ? fan do . this collection of song span his early career with all the best music . gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter . never one for ballad , his music is quite original and thought provoking . this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad . i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit . since 1999 gowan is still performing . now with the band styx . never-the-less it is his early year i remember with fondness .
1	this is a classic . anyone into hard punk should give this album a try . especially , good riddance is an amazing song . great precision and no mercy .
0	i bought this song , hoping that this version also included the verse a well a the refrain . sadly , it is only the refrain . my mom used to sing this song around the house , and i had searched for a long time for a recording ( with word ) . the listen ability on amazon only give a bit of the refrain , but i purchased it anyway with great hope . ok , it wa only 99 cent , so no harm done . but , it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse .
0	there were only a few song i liked . not what i expected .
0	buyer beware , this is only a sample of the track . it is only a 20 second clip . not worth $ 1 !
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album , i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse . although second album are known to be difficult , i beleived the band to have promise . how wrong wa i. there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face . it all highly irritating , mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless . i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way , but there is no melody on this album worth writing about .
1	i liked this song when i first heard it on the loud speaker at the gym , while i wa working out with weight .
1	jessye norman ha a voice that is rich a the most elegant satin . i have purchased quite a few of her piece , why ? because thanks to amazon music , i can pick and choose and download the one i want . i have now loaded many of her spiritual , both solo and with kathleen battle , onto both the computer and my mp3 player , to enjoy whenever i choose . her singing is grand , the selecton is wonderful , and the price is right .
0	i bought this for my aunt because she remembered it from she wa a kid and she claim she is happy with it . i do not care for this type of grade school music
0	this remake of dylan music is almost unrecognizable and disturbing to the ear . it wa sad . a i like ben sidrans style but this is a joke and i wa super sad i ordered it . mr sidran is from my home town and i wanted to support him , the local review were favorable . but it is awlful and i will put it in to my resale or charity box for the next drop off trip. < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/dylan-different/dp/b002upq1q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?
0	take some no-doze before you listen to this one .
1	so , band of horse is a new band to me . suffice to say , it is now a if i have been a fan for year . their song are infectious , a they are deep and meaningful . the instrumentation , vocal , and composition are fantastic . what a song .
1	i discovered amazon cloud and the first piece i downloaded wa der teufel and the sound fill the room . i recommend the cloud and the schubert for .89 , how can you go wrong .
0	very slick only giving the weeknd a single hook verse otherwise he would have killed this song . very dissapointed do not buy if you are looking for the weeknd
