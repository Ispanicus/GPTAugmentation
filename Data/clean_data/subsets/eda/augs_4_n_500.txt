1	this product takes the form of deuce compact discs on the decca label the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the vocalizer is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in da klangende lied the outspoken are not as salient as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the deuce discs the outspoken are more salient it is so the event that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders singing vogue if you lack to forebode it singing admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this freakish exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a salient role in any recording it damages the recording and has the likely to stimulate the hearer to be annoyed get at and furious in some form of music such as i couch a spell on you as record by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to use up as record by the grindcore circle carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasance of the listen experience but fassbaender go wrong to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music besides fassbaender go wrong to realize that mahlers music is not some type of gewgaw sung dynasty as is the event with i couch a spell on you for this reasonableness i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other pieces on this magnetic disc set the compositions on the magnetic disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only trey of the thirteen of the song of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review article provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billystick of herb simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason out reveal below this review article besides provides a side by side comparison of unity of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the sung dynasty about the angle with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billystick of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason out heel below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of da klagende lied unity of my very favourite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get with softened kettledrum drums at the second point the french horns provide a short circuit riff then at back the transverse flute join in the french horns summarise at back and at back the john reed and strings join the fray at back the french horns join in again and here they play a rattling tune not just a riff at back the melody ply by the entire orchestra condescend to a scummy pitch and the previously introduce theme are repeat but at the scummy pitch at unity minute and back comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break apart of cymbal these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of da klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit particular exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen get with a background haphazardness hum that stopping point for a second but the rattle recording commence with music not with any hum liken waldmarchen immortalize under the billystick of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and back while the rattle timing is minutes and back in the chailly recording the tenor voice werner hollweg puddle his entry at amoy sec singing unity of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly bum in the rattle recording the tenor voice robert tear puddle his entry at amoy back robert tears voice is jolly creamy sounding jolly comparable that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason out unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle recording has a tenor voice and a baritone the tenor voice is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the future apparent movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable departure to my spike in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle immortalize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording alfileria at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is severalize by solo flourishes from the kettledrum drums a stiff freshwater bass phone line ply by tubas and string along basso and blaring brass this third apparent movement of da klagende lied is severalize by the presence of an off arrange circle which is practically quieter than the on arrange orchestra the off arrange circle can be heard for good example in the separation of to when the off arrange circle is playing the only other reference of music is outspoken soloists at to the lowest degree for this separation of metre this apparent movement besides feature article a chorus penchant for the observe reason out i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording was record at a in high spirits intensity and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterise as very slightly muddy besides i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the bum voice of hollweg the observe compares da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only trey song as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the virile while others by the female person my favourite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the sung dynasty about the angle and i comparable this unity the best because it is the same tune as that establish in the waltz apparent movement in mahlers symphony no anyways this compares the angle sung dynasty des marcus antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado immortalize famous feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme occur at back and back and the five second donkey comparable hee haw from clarinets that take place at back and again at back the man concludes with a gloomy intensity mysterious sounding formosan chime i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason out first of all the chailly recording of the angle sung dynasty has too practically echo besides in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender let the cat out of the bag at the same pitch as the transverse flute and because brigitte fassbaender puddle her voice waver and flit with her vibrato the clarinet donkey vocalize is not practically noticeable in the chailly recording besides the very stop of the man in the chailly recording feature article a salient gloomy note from a bassoon and to my spike the mysterious sounding formosan chime does not occur at the stop of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i comparable and prefer about the abbado recording is the laconic vocalize and the more easily discernable fluttery transverse flute donkey hee haw and mysterious formosan chime conclusion the chailly recording provides a neat selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other immortalize will enable any hearer to decide on a prefer recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for immortalize under the billystick of herb simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favourite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favourite since the year it was write when gustav mahler was only old age old

moments of das klagende lied unrivaled of my very preferred pieces from the classical repertory waldmarchen begins with stifle kettle drums at the second full point the french saddle horn provide a short flick then at s the flutes link in the french saddle horn resume at s and at s the vibrating reed and strings link the chafe at s the french saddle horn link in again and here they play a real melodic phrase not just a flick at s the melodies ply by the integral orchestra descend to a take down pitch and the antecedently presented motifs are reiterated but at the take down pitch at unrivaled moment and s comes a momentary crescendo it is a boastful crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timings are for the rattle recording this and other start out of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a play down noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording protrude with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly clock is mo and s while the rattle clock is mo and s in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg ready his enamour at min s swinge unrivaled of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertory mr hollwegs vocalize is more or less cheesy in the rattle recording the strain robert binge ready his enamour at min s robert tears vocalize is somewhat creamy looking somewhat like that of norman mattoon thomas quasthoff thence i have a very flimsy preference for the rattle recording for ground unknown to me the chailly recording has a strain werner hollweg and a basso andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a strain and a baritone the strain is robert binge and the baritone is sean rea the side by side drive in das klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable divergence to my ear in the spread mo of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the spread moment is mark by solo fanfare from the kettle drums a strong basso line ply by tubas and string basses and blast brass this third gear drive of das klagende lied is mark by the comportment of an off stagecoach stria which is much still than the on stagecoach orchestra the off stagecoach stria can be heard for good example in the musical interval of to when the off stagecoach stria is playing the only other reference of euphony is vocal soloists at least for this musical interval of time this drive also features a chorus preferences for the following ground i have a flimsy preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more toast and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterize as very more or less muddy also i have a flimsy preference for robert tears vocalize over the cheesy vocalize of hollweg the following compare das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by norman mattoon thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as impart by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly recording there are only three vocal as i mentioned above and these are song by brigitte fassbaender who manipulation a enunciate vibrato in the abbado recording some of the vocal are song by the manful while others by the female my preferred of all of the vocal from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces the fishes and i like this unrivaled the best because it is the same melody as that determine in the valse drive in mahler symphony orchestra no anyway this compare the pisces the fishes song stilbesterol antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings famed features of the abbado recording are the fluttery transverse flute motifs occurring at s and s and the five second donkey like hee haw from clarinets that occurs at s and again at s the bit concludes with a low volume secret looking chinese chime i opt the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many ground first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery transverse flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender ready her vocalize flitter and flap with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the bit in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the secret looking chinese chime does not go on at the end of the chailly recording to repeat these points what i like and opt about the abbado recording is the snappy sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey hee haw and secret chinese chime end the chailly recording leave a with child selection of mahler pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side compare of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any hearer to determine on a favor recording i did my own side by side compare and attain that i had a flimsy preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very preferred of mahler compositions and it has been my preferred since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty dollar bill eld onetime
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
