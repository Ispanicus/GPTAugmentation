0	there look to be a conjunct effort by a number of rooter to boost the ratings of this by put up glowing review article so its going to be slightly more challenging to decrypt what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a devotee who would give to a register of groban reading the telephone directory i also assume therefore that any review article that are not favourable will come with a people see this review of use committed all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this are not a self confessed music starved groban devotee who is just happy to hear fresh music after respective years and if you have access to listen to it via a teem service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed review article really do indicate that this album is polarise listeners and rooter not least because the greater copiousness of falsetto that has cringe in you may enjoy it but i would strain before you bribe first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious devotee of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster five rubin matter so this isnt a long for a return to the older way recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album establish on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the select of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his springy version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to oft however i dont find that he done that and yet at the same clock i cerebrate he charged off in many dissimilar directions i just do not know what to make of this album even after push myself to listen to it for a twelve times or so when id rather have left it entirely im mindful that some album require work to grow on you therefore i wanted to give it a bump but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every clock i listen there is a reenforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave cover charge massive orchestral placement an italian song massive orchestral placement london anthem im expecting to hear it palmy out of city of westminster abbey any clock presently and terrifying me with ball over interspersed with songs that are i assume the stripped down sound groban was hope to attain to me it just doesnt flowing or have any coherence as an album i just find that its trying to be so many dissimilar things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the deutsche mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is oft scripted as i honestly believe that groban judging from awake february song can express a far greater astuteness of emotion than he does here some of the harsher mention involve the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are show in some review article are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really lack to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by rooter having said that i certainly do remain a devotee and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the deutsche mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont lack to demote it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before regularise the like some other reviewer i cant natural the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its outride in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that closing curtain to blue pencil to add i have noticed some commenting involve what i said about rooter put up irrefutable review article because of a perceived backlash to the album my commentary make out as a result of a wander on his functionary boards entitled be sure to farewell a or star review on virago com the could use them i just cerebrate that people who are not rooter and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a fresh artist to them should hear a proportion of ruling jg rooter have justifiedly or wrong a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the irrefutable review article are very clearly not shoot for at just boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in item what they like about the music that wander was sent as a link up to many rooter and as such it could have an touch on on here i cerebrate its only fair to signal that out and people can then decide for themselves
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this cd by posting glowing reviews so its going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory i also presume therefore that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a people found this review of use attached all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd are not a self confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it the mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in you may enjoy it but i would try before you buy first my own personal thoughts i will freely admit that i was never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i dont view this as a foster v rubin thing so this isnt a hankering for a return to the older style recordings in fact i was eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction he had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this as did his live version of changing colours which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often however i dont feel that hes done that and yet at the same time i think hes charged off in many different directions i just do not know what to make of this album even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when id rather have left it alone im aware that some albums require work to grow on you hence i wanted to give it a chance but this isnt happening sadly its the opposite effect and every time i listen there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and cant face listening to some of the tracks the nick cave cover massive orchestral arrangement an italian song massive orchestral arrangement london hymn im expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock interspersed with songs that are i presume the stripped down sound groban was hoping to achieve to me it just doesnt flow or have any coherence as an album i just feel that its trying to be so many different things and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark i find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as i honestly believe that groban judging from awakes february song can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are i probably can guess even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans having said that i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically even if it sometimes misses the mark i cant face giving this one star because i dont want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd like another reviewer i cant cancel the order winging its way over the atlantic sadly its staying in the packaging to be gifted to someone that im probably not that close to edited to add i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fans posting positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album my comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards entitled be sure to leave a or star review on amazon com the cd could use them i merely think that people who are not fans and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them should hear a balance of opinions jg fans have rightly or wrongly a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music that thread was sent as a link to many fans and as such it could have an impact on here i think its only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves

0	this dance band was my religion and my law for years that start to decline when i set out feeling fleece by the incessant unloosen of live albums and dvds as fountainhead as very disappointing albums i think thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymns retrograde come about now this eric adams doesnt sing lyrics it audio alike he is saying them he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the well vocalist in alloy hamzigs swot up is fine its nice to hear him perform something other than bh birdsong i never thought i would enounce this but karl logan guitar work doesnt bother me on this album its simple and gets the job perform no silly flashy take on alike he usually does defy i enounce he may finally be take on with some sieve of feeling unmatched of the few unassailable spot of this album it pains me to enounce that since he was a jerk when i met him ok time to hurt someone feelings demaios bass audio alike a synthesizer or using a slide to play the notes its pretty bad and annoying every song it audio the same i am dumbfounded over this awed sound and it demands an explanation is this his seek at dub dance step it certainly isnt the true alloy sound the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channels for an interesting speaker or headphone experience unmatched thing edm has that this album doesnt is heavy bass seriously if you are going to seek destine alloy black list you need that late bass meritless put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve not so many birdsong about vikings which should be left to amon amarth and it tolerant of reminds me of sign of the power hammer album lyrics i can never forgive all mankind and small scale boys and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a fountainhead please soth is an awesome album and this isnt at times they cue me of dr eugene sue rhymes which of course is what rap music is alike the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley perchance he fall behind that word among the refrigerator attractor used to construct the lyrics of this album lets shoot a look at each song the lord of nerve starts off alike a dr eugene sue rime but has musical moments otiose lyric write poor opening song to an album manowarriors again has musical moments but we listen these lyrics before another letdown i expected a good anthem alike warriors of the world nope birth in a grave finally some lyrics and music that are different not a bad song but the mixing is idiotic and ruins it at this point i enquire why isnt eric singing righteous aureole for the first time mention of odin on the album it would have been nice to use erics vocals better on this unmatched he can sing so get him i wonder if he was puke the daylight they recorded this album have to doe with the sky the bass is idiotic on this song its alike an incessant hum of tones and

0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm was still a member of the band the only original holdover at this point i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as the blues magoos that said like the predecessor set s never going back to georgia anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped s gulf coast bound on their turntable working with original blues magoos producer bob wyld these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first abc album added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred ellis and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne as a result the collection featured the same general sound as the earlier lp leading to speculation at least some of these tracks were recorded during the earlier sessions and left off that album because they were longer and less commercial regardless of their history ive always been a big blues magoos fan but their final two albums have always reminded me of the way the rascals got away from their creative strengths like that other band this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic careers at the feet of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influences with three percussionists in the mix tracks like slow down sundown cant get enough of you and the instrumental magoos blues were simply buried in layers of latin flavored percussion and soul jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sounds the same disease the combination of latin percussion and pseudo jazzy moves flatulent horns and aimless vibes may have sounded good on paper but i dare anyone to try sitting through the minute cant get enough of you simply horrible adding to their problems neither kas shown as kaz on the writing credits nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice they may have sounded okay in a live setting but in the studio the results proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental breaks provided some of the album highlights propelled by alfred ellis on sax the title track found the band taking a stab at a blues number in the positive column this was the albums shortest and most focused performance in the negative column the song was a mess sporting a forgettable melody crappy vocals and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion ellis endless sax solo just made things worse rating stars slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove but the harsh strained lead vocal the jazzy touches discordance sax solos apparently meant to sound like jungle animals vibes and heavy percussion ultimately killed it okay the fart sound at the end of the song always makes me smile rating stars and then there was the plus minute epic cant get enough of you the song actually started out sounding pretty good nice funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar and then things turned horribly wrong hideous group vocals i think kaz had the lead on this one a meandering melody and endless and pointless solos imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and youll know what this one sounded like rating stars penned by newcomer ellis the instrumental magoos blues showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe think about mid s elevator music and youll get a feel for this one technically it was quite impressive with lots of space for individual solos but it was also sort of soulless rating stars tonight the skys about to cry was a bland vocally painful and instantly forgettable ballad rating star the lone group composition the instrumental sea breeze express was best describe as a meandering piece of jazz rock fusion their are some folks that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff but to my ears its basically noise rating star the album was also tapped for a single their last s gulf coast bound b w sea breeze express abc catalog sporting one of the years ugliest covers blame designer ron lieberman certainly didnt help sales all told a sad footnote to their recording legacy gulf coast bound track listing side gulf coast bound eric kaz emil thielhelm slow down sundown eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm cant get enough of you eric kaz side magoos blues instrumental alfred ellis tonight the skys about to cry eric kaz j andreolli sea breeze express instrumental eric kaz j andreolli emil thielhelm alfred ellis richie dickon jim payne john liello j lopresti for anyone interested the blues magoos are still active and have a web presence at

and hovering thread i get word or read someplace that this will be the second unity off the record album an odd conclusion i believe but who knows maybe it needs more listens the sung seems a little vapid at some points but holds suspense from an instrumentation maneuver of reckon be a bee definitely not a sung youd think transmit would garden truck with its western like feel the sung sounds like something off a surfing documentary its fun but also lack differentiation on all fronts it could have done with some structuring overhauling not the greatest sung on the record album but hey thats something youll believably be manipulation to at this phase right missing the tripping of the day an interesting line with some rather alone sounds if youve always seen transmit live youd know what im talking about they appear to garden truck some pretty foul smelling while throughout their set and this sung is a pretty proficient indicator of that if youve get word any of brian enos earlier albums you could arrive at a comparison with this songs psuedo alternatuve twisting nothing overly exciting but a worthwhile listen tropical disease the albums longest line and i of the better in my thought contrary to what ive citation so far with regards to lyric absence ive always been i to take to airs implemental cut across i believe it payoff a higher level maneuver of musical comedy integrity to garden truck a track that satisfies your audience depending totally on instrumentation and dynamic presence the sung sounds like two turned into i the first half is up metre and has a similar essence to be a bee as it come along it slows down into an ambient tableland reminiscent of something off talkie walkie heavens tripping definitely i of the albums standout cut across itd be right at home with the likes of la femme dargent and ce matin la believably the albums most chill out list with its swirling progressions especially towards the middle half and heavenly vocal conniption my personal favorite and a seamlessly staring ambient line night hunting watch another implemental track with a great metre to it cross the electronica soundscapes of cycle per second fable and add the piano driven feel of the absolute majority of pocket symphony and you have this great compounding of ambience and almost down tempo like rhythm a great addition to the second half of the record album and an homage to the lighter side of transmit sing sang sung dynasty well what can we state about this well airs most accessible pa sung to date with an amazing exertion from the boy and their distaff vocalist with a musical comedy extract that sounds like something from a tlpopmusik record album this list is well i of the better on the entire record album simple nevertheless so effective in its delivery theres just enough contrast between greek chorus poetize and so on to give the line a refreshing feel if youre going to get someone into this record album nay transmit themselves this might be a proficient starting maneuver wipe out my metre i of the shortest on the record album the sung is a proficient go against from the ambient implemental driven latter half of the record album with its brewing crescendos mid day through the firearm it acquaint an awesome little synth melody subscriber line which is constipate to engage further interest you can state it to everybody an awesome chill out track to begin the conclusion phase of the record album once again i determine myself being reminded of the later half of moon on safari with this i modern star in the sky chanson pour solal would have this as its little sister acoustic and laid back in its attack this line is a near staring night sung with its warp harmonica entracte its constipate to sooth whatever regret youre experiencing and take you to a calmer place african velvety whilst at first this may not appear like your fair record album closer african velvety is believably i of the most interesting cut across on the record album with its hand peck guitar segments and its front subscriber line horn melody its a staring way to close of this special record album with a smooth bass subscriber line hinting the likes of la femme dargent velvety will doubtlessly discharge interest and keep you listening to the last note a great way to close off love i gave this exertion from transmit four stars in the end but im not ruing out a higher score its definitely an record album that needs a few listens for it to truly soakage in not as accessible as their earlier albums but for anyone whos been hanging for a different attack fomr these french ambient masters your wait is over if i could relate it to any record album antecedently relinquish id state cycle per second fable on i hand this record album may be sour for fans of airs more chill out tunes but on the other love has the makings of attracting a whole modern market denomination of listeners from all turning point of the music globe give it a go and dont give up after a few listens itll rise on you trust me
1	air recall with bonk their salutary work in my opinion since s moon safari the french duo have taken a more experimental coming to this album frequently cut into amongst walls of sound do the delight and synth driven scopes be a bee alternatively the album offers mayhap airs more accessible pop melodic phrase to see with sing sang sung with this type of contrast noteworthy from quite a an former present on the album unity has to expect some surprises along the style do the delight an odd track to start the album with nevertheless a honest indicator of the albums flow and overall feel the strain sound like something from hz caption with its multi layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very to the lowest degree bonk once again not your typical second strain it holds a sense of chasteness though and as the strain progresses it flex from a introductory loop into a courteous indulgent like piece with a corking chord progression and line the glockenspiel adds an amazing feel sound like something youd hear at the end of moon safari particularly the later half of the piece it wasnt my preferent at low gear but after a few listens it grew on me so unclouded is her football the low gear strain to rattling feature lyrical kinetics the euphony sound sac symphony era with the strain being driven by piano and hovering strings i heard or read someplace that this will be the second individual off the album an odd decision i conceive but who knows maybe it needs more listens the strain seems a little bland at some points but holds suspense from an orchestration channelise of view be a bee definitely not a strain youd think air would produce with its western like feel the strain sound like something off a surfing documentary its fun but also lacks differentiation on all front it could have coiffe with some structuring overhauling not the cracking strain on the album but hey thats something youll probably be use to at this present right overlook the unclouded of the day an interesting melodic phrase with some kinda unique sound if youve of all time seen air hold up youd hold up

degree of musical comedy wholeness to produce a track that satisfies your audience depending entirely on orchestration and dynamical presence the strain sound like ii get into unity the low gear half

1	i do not pretend to be familiar with south the details of tanes career aside from explicate what i can retrieve infer from listening to only her music and i havent yet heard all of her s era releases because theyre a little difficult to find but given absolutely the fact that sole the vast majority of lunar month her work subsequent to the s falls into the pop and light jazz genres i get the impression that for hetero her manager or producer whatever was trying to nudge her into alt rock that tane herself was generalise more interested quoin in pop and light jazz equitable but pullulate acquiesced to a harder edged album all the same an refrain artist is completely going to follow her own path obviously but i wish tane san wouldve done an album or two more of straight ahead rock because shes good at it and her voice is well equitable suited for it the hetero album is equal something that fans of rock and female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some prison term minor downsides its akin to a operation buried pop rock treasure since theres daniel chester french no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite associate in nursing give it back starts with poke at a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists information technology in list chord progression picks up whatsoever a inclination wind up stark thin drumbeat then whatsoever dives group a into an refrain excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses in that respect a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a to a greater extent great understated rock tune down is far more poppy easygoing but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal consanguineal over simple waterspout percussion and later some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice rock n roll shines refrain through its completely difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which associate in nursing sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out tan at me heavy even nosepiece years after i first heard this disc cut the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres premix a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in associate in nursing the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end bass part just an only excellent groove from start only to finish ame to gamu ingredient chewing gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song some other is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really anon weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it remind all nobelium meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like producer frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of nab the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar deliberate is rarely relegated to harmonise that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in equitable the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the rock n roll mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists to a greater extent on earth masaki of daida laida and liv embark on moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits equitable onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or ditto mark why japan has nab an abundance indiana of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal song indiana but i refrain idiomatic expression am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal disclose here and i almost forgot sang froid something that puts a big consider goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental ended or intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the approximately best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just apprehend epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it acoustical begins soft as a feather builds and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic lilliputian bridge turns a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that builds to its group a own crescendo with tane pouring equal heart and soul into the vocal to slow down end on that same soft as a feather place it started this is one of those tunes you can listen to for atmospherical the first time today groove yet will seem like it was only the backdrop for some of the most before moving experiences of your bleed life a song thats been with you for fuck up years that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar equal on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and indiana drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this only is the tune i like least on the album mostly it because of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a horrid song but to me the choruses group a are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden rock n roll pagoda in a equal cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the refrain bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a associate in nursing shadow is the most jazzy tune on center the disc more in line with the stuff shes done only since but an section excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses recoil then the same

female vocalists should snap up at their first opportunity because although it has some minor downsides its akin to a buried pop rock treasure since theres no track listing here ill do a blow by blow kaeshite give it back starts with a strange almost playful verse takes some wonderfully unexpected twists in chord progression picks up a stark thin drumbeat then dives into an excellent somewhat angsty chorus which again traverses a chord progression unlike anything ive heard before just a great understated rock tune down is far more poppy but with the same arresting vocal attitude the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard but heres where tanes unique voice shines through its difficult for me to explain exactly why but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow maybe its because of that strange vibrato which sounds both tightly controlled and loose at the same time but that comparison keeps jumping out at me even years after i first heard this disc cut the fruits is a little funky a little jazzy with beautiful floating upbeat transitional grooves between verses and choruses theres a satisfying gnarly twangy guitar break in the bridge then back to that glide groove then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end just an excellent groove from start to finish ame to gamu chewing gum candy is hard to describe again its vocal over acoustic guitar something that ordinarily bores the hell out of me but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding there is a lot of really weird instrumentation synth washes and french accordion but it all meshes perfectly the bridge is a bass solo something that seems to send american producers running like frightened rabbits if youve spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop one of the first happy discoveries you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum dum dum dum dum drone buried deep in the background but rather is an integral catalyzing element of the mix how or why japan has some of the most phenomenal bassists on earth masaki of daida laida and liv moon koga michiko of doll boxx and gacharic spin king san formerly of shakalabbits onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary hibiki of light bringer etc is beyond me ditto how or why japan has an abundance of recording engineers and producers who treat the bass as an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal but i am really really glad thats the case anyhow ame to gamu is an unforgettable song and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here and i almost forgot something that puts a big goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chords of the song are a quote of that three chord figure in jimis wind cries mary whether thats incidental or intentional it just makes me smile memoria is maybe the best song on this album but undercut by an annoyance in the recording the heavier parts are noticeably distorted you have to push that annoyance aside because memoria is just epic one of those songs thats like a heartfelt little journey or adventure it begins soft as a feather builds and builds explodes in anthemic choruses then after a brief acoustic bridge turns a corner into an unexpected melodically magical passage that builds to its own crescendo with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal to end on that same soft as a feather place it started this is one of those tunes you can listen to for the first time today yet will seem like it was the backdrop for some of the most moving experiences of your life a song thats been with you for years that folks is powerful songwriting just a great song easily one of my all time faves its unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the choruses but great song no joker starts with tanes sly vocal over piano and drums that sound a little like solo john lennon but this is the tune i like least on the album mostly because of the choruses which have tane stretching her range too much amid repeats of the line i wanna be your woman i wanna be your woman its not a horrid song but to me the choruses are awkward and a little annoying and the bridge is just weird and not in a good way kakekko sprint or race is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb ambience evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst theres also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge kage no naka no kage shadow in the middle of a shadow is the most jazzy tune on the disc more in line with the stuff shes done since but an excellent relaxed groove daite te hoshii i want you to hold me is another jazzy tune mellower than kage with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulses then the same over a drumbeat with some funk flavored instrumentation with the choruses the vocal melody is not as interesting as the rest of the songs which leads me to believe its one of those songs that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality just a guess since my nihongo skills are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrases in any language namely where is the beer where is the restroom and i love you generally in that order and i havent sat down to translate it tree closes out the album in a dreamy atmospheric wash with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fits the song perfectly there are two breaks into slower tempo grooves that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song an understated but relentlessly cool tune im far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop so although there are a lot of her tunes i like from later albums hetero is her standout disc for that rock element but again i still havent gotten around to getting her other s discs if you like alt rock thats generally upbeat rather than a massive boat anchor of metaphysical angst and if you enjoy totally unique voices get hetero definitely time well spent
