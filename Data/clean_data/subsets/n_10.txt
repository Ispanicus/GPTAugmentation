0	sigh . conor , what happened ? for the past decade you have given u the most amazing lyric , the most stripped down ( or fancifully gussied up ) tune and then you go and drop this mess on u ? your album prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but the people key doe nothing to advance the dialogue . stilted lyric , out of place electro effect and a rambling , incoherent vein throughout make this one to pas on and pretend it never happened . a little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around , gentleman . signed , someone who gave all your other album 5 star and would have given lifted 6 star if that were possible . your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music a well a the overwhelming let-down factor .
