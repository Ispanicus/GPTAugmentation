Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe I just listened to this album for the first time. I like the r. Kelly and Madrox albums but man do they suck!  There's a lot of good songs but they're all covered by Madrox.  He's the worst rapper I have ever heard.  The albums would have been better if they stuck with the singles.  No lyrics, no hooks, nothing.  I'm glad I got the other two albums.

Amazon review: Just a quick note... you are right. The CD is a little scratched (a few scratches), but the tracks are good.  The cover of Twiztid is a little off, I mean... it is not very Twiztid, I mean... that man is not going to put his face on it.  This is a good album though.  I think you did a good job on this review.  Keep up the good work.

Amazon review: Twiztid is very disappointed in the quality of the CD.  It was not intended to be a collector's piece.  It is a product of a failed company.  The CD is a complete disappointment.

Amazon review: The Twiztid album is a pretty good album. I think the songs are ok, but not to be compared with the songs in the Madrox albums.  The songs are better than those from the Madrox albums.  I am not a fan of Madrox.  He is a stupid ass.  But you gotta respect the man for putting out good albums.

Amazon review: Really good album, but a little disappointing.  Like many other albums from Twiztid he tries to fit a bunch of random shit into the same song.  You can tell it was written by him.  The songs are very good.  The only problem I have with this album is the last track.  Really good song, but with that last track, I couldn't help but think that Twiztid was trying to make a song out of something that he's not even good at.  He's just a rapper, but if you listen to the last song, it seems that Twiztid was trying to make a record out of a song that he can't even rap to.  That is the only thing that bothered me about this album and it's almost insulting.  But on the other hand, I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought that.  I don't know how the songs are supposed to be so good.  They are written by Twiztid.  He doesn't do anything with them.  I don't know why people say that Madrox is better.  He's a rapper.  I'm not.  He's better at singing than rapping.  I don't know why you would expect me to buy this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a fan of Twiztid, but I have to say that he has put out a few good discs over the years.  The reason I am giving this one a positive review is because Madrox is probably the most disappointing artist that Twiztid has put out in the past.  His rapping is pretty funny.  The one song I really like is the one in the middle of the CD.  The song is called "Twiztid" by Twiztid & Madrox.  I like the song very much.  The second song I like is the one that I think Twiztid could really sing.  That song is called "It's Better to be Rich Than Be a Millionaire" by Twiztid & Madrox.  I like the music on this CD very much.  It is like a rap/rock/rap double album.  I like the songs on this CD.  I would recommend this CD to people who like hip-hop.  You can tell that Twiztid has put a good effort into this CD.  I don't think I will buy this CD again.  The lyrics are a little bit confusing.  I don't know if it was a conscious effort to do so, but they could have done a better job.

A little bit about the band: This band is a very talented group. The songs sound like they were written by people who are very creative, but not just for that reason. Some of the songs are really fast and others are slow, just as they were written. They all have their own style, but if you listen to them all you know that they are very talented and have lots of interesting style.

I have owned the first album and have listened to the cd twice. It is very good for the price, and i plan on buying the second cd when it is released.

I have tried to give you a full review on this album, but I do not know how. I listened to the cd in my car and it was very good and I do get tired of hearing the same songs over and over and over again. I do not like that they are so repetitive.

I have listened to the cd on my work computer and it was very good and I do get tired of hearing the same old songs. I do not like that they are so repetitive.

Amazon review: Don't think I've ever written an Amazon review before, but I have enjoyed listening to this song, and I have bought it for my wife.  I'm not sure what I could have done to turn this into a negative review.  After all, it's a one-time purchase.  I don't think I have a problem with a song, but in this case, the song is about a man and a woman falling in love and having sex.  The man is a jazz musician who comes to the woman's place, but she doesn't know him, and they end up having sex.  The song is about the woman's fear of being with the man, and the man's fear of having sex with her.  I don't feel that it's a negative review.  I was glad to find that the song was free, and I don't think I would have bothered to write a review if I did not think this was worth a download.

I only have one complaint about the song, I think the last line should be "And I am" instead of "And I am a" or "And I am an."  I really like the song, it is a nice soft background song.

Amazon review: My first experience with Schubert's lieder.  I was taken with the first few pieces, but I was also taken by the repetitiveness and the harmonic sound.  After the third time, I was not impressed.  This is a very repetitive collection of songs.  It's all about the same chord progressions and the same melodies.  It was a disappointing experience.  I was really looking forward to listening to this CD since he is a composer I know nothing about.  I believe this CD is one that will be enjoyed by those who are passionate about music and who are willing to take a chance on a new composer.

Amazon review: I am a recent convert to Schubert's music.  I was introduced to him by my cousin.  He was kind enough to send me this CD.  I bought the entire collection of his lieder and have listened to several times.  I have to say, after listening three times I am a bit disappointed.  I do like the sound of the lieder and enjoy the arrangements.  The problem is, it's just not the Schubert I know and love.  I do like the melodies, but not in the way I think they should be.  The choral arrangements are not the best, but they are not bad.  I have listened to a number of Schubert's lieder and believe I am beginning to enjoy the music.  I will continue to listen and hopefully make an improvement.

Amazon review: This is the best collection of Schubert's lieder that I have ever heard.  Even the arrangements were well done, and the singers did their job.  It's a shame the arrangements are so repetitive.

I had to turn the CD off after listening to it.  But, the song is still a nice way to end the CD.

If I were to purchase this CD, I would listen to it more than once.  I like the melodies, but I don't think that they will be as appealing to me as they are to the reviewer.  The voices were very soft and pleasant to listen to, and for the most part, the songs were pleasant.  I will continue to listen to the CD to see if the reviewer is right.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Jewel was very shy while on the show. This CD is a great effort to show her in a new light for American Idol. She has a lovely voice, but I feel like she did her best with what she had. I like the songs and the songs are well-written. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that there are some songs with very repetitive lyrics. You can't help but repeat them. I think that they are kind of catchy. But it's just that I don't like repeating a lot of things. I'm a little confused on why she sang one song in Spanish. I feel like she's trying to sound like a Spanish person. I'm not sure what she was trying to say. I think she's going to become one of those Spanish singers, like Christina Aguilera. Well, I hope she doesn't, I hope she writes more songs in English.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the songs and the vocals. The singing is very good and the album is very good. I was surprised at her ability to sing in Spanish although she is not a natural-born Spanish speaker. She has a beautiful soul and I appreciate her effort to show her natural talents even though she wasn't born with the talent. The recording quality is very good. But I think this CD is rather boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Jewel was a good singer. She sang well. However, I didn't like her singing. She sang like she knows she is good, but she just can't sing it like a real person. That is a shame because she is a very good song writer. I like her style. She had a good sense of humor. I would even say she is a good singer. Her voice was fine. I don't think she sang the way I like to hear her sing. I have to change the channel.

Amazon review: I actually liked this CD...she was very shy on the show, but she was very good. I can't say it was a big improvement over her old songs that I liked.

I hope to see her on American Idol.

Amazon review: My friend is a professional cellist, and she was telling me "I really believe that this is the BEST pop album ever made, and I have no idea why I am not buying it and giving it to my 5 year old nephew to listen to, or giving it to my wife." She also pointed out that I don't understand anything about music. She's right. I've been listening to this crap for two weeks now, and I've realized that this is just a terrible album. The sound quality of the music is horrible, the music is bland and does NOT move me, and it has a terrible song called "If You Let Me." My friend suggested that this album is good for a couple of hours of relaxation, but then you would want to go to bed. I believe her. There's only one CD in this entire album that has any redeeming qualities at all, and that's the second CD. I'm not sure how well this record sounds because I can't see it, but it's a pretty decent CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very pleasant album, even though I don't think it's very good. I love the way that the songs have the same tempo on different songs, but not too much (especially in the second half) so that you won't think that it's the same song over and over again. I'm also a big fan of the music on this album, and I love the different melodies on different songs. The only thing that is a little odd about this CD is that it has the exact same melody in all the songs and the same tempo in all of the songs. I don't think that's enough, and I think that the tempo is too fast to be able to put your attention to the songs. The only thing that makes me believe that the music on this CD is good is the fact that I love the melodies on the songs.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this for quite some time, and I can't find anything much to say. All the songs sound the same (except maybe for the intro, which makes me think that it's probably a good intro to the album, but not a good song). The lyrics are uninspiring, and the music is just too repetitive. I can't find anything bad about it, and I can't find anything good either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the fact that the songs are all very, very similar, but I don't like the fact that they are only a little bit different on each song. The songs sound the same. I think it's the same song over and over again. Like, "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" and "You Don't Have to Be a Star" are the same song. The only difference is that one is a bit slower. And then the last song, "Crimson and Clover", is a bit faster. The songs are also very repetitive, but the only difference is that one song is slower than the other. I think this album is great for relaxing, but not for listening to while you are relaxing.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It's hard to find a good song for a girl without a great voice.  Even if she has a great voice, she still has to have a good song to sing.  I'm not sure why I like this one.  I think it's a little on the sweet side.  I don't think I would listen to this every day, but if I need a little something to sing to my mom, this would be it.  It's hard to tell if the song is good or bad.  It definitely has a nice melody to it.  I don't think I would listen to this everyday, but it could be nice for a special occasion or for someone who just feels special on that day.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The album "The Revolution is Calling" is a collection of songs by the musical group Lin Manuel Miranda and Alex Lacamore.  It features the works of Libera and a few other artists.    The album is outstanding.  The boys sing their own compositions (and some of Lin Manuel's), and a number of other songs.  When this album was first released, the band was billed as Libera.    The album has a very positive and positive vibe.    The only negative is, after hearing it, I'm really not sure if there will be another album by Lin Manuel and Alex Lacamore.    I'm not sure the band will be able to sustain their creativity with the same level of quality that has been achieved in this album.    The band has been going through some very difficult times, and I have no doubt that it is going to get even harder.    I don't think there will be another album released by this band.                The track "What You Are" features lyrics by Alex Lacamore, which may also be sung by Lin Manuel Miranda.  The song has a good message of being a rebel.    The lyrics are very positive and uplifting.    The last song is called "Para Volver", and it has a very positive message of looking forward to seeing what the future holds.

This album is a beautiful tribute to the revolution!

LOL, this is the second album I have listened to of Lin Manuel Miranda and his band. The first one, "The Revolution is Calling", is just as amazing as this one. It is definitely worth the download if you love musicals.

I had this album first, and i really enjoyed it. I listened to it a few times and then I started to get bored with it and then I listened to it again. After listening to this album several times I finally fell in love with it. It's an amazing album and it's not just for the young guys. The album has a great message. Its very positive and it's a great way to get to know the world and how its different from your own way of thinking. I'm going to see the show on Broadway and I'm going to love Lin Manuel Miranda and his band. I'm going to buy this album, and I'm going to listen to it often.

Wow.... Just wow.... This is so good. I am a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda, and I am a fan of the music that he has made. That's all I am saying. This album is amazing. I love it!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the opera "The Barber of Seville". I have listened to the CDs of the recording made by the Metropolitan Opera of the opera by Mozart. The Mozart is marvelous and always has my heart. When I went to this site and listened to the Schubert songs I was not disappointed. They are all beautifully done and make me want to listen to them over and over again. Every time I go through my music collection, I listen to these songs and see how often I can listen to them. When I get home I go through my CD's and take out the songs that I feel are the best.  For me it is always Schubert.  I'm not a fan of Wagner. I have always thought that there was something wrong with him. But I have become a fan of Schubert.  I would not call myself a fan of the music of Wagner, but I find that Wagner is a very good composer, but not one that I like very much. I think that the composer of Die Walküre is one that I have always been a fan of.

At first I was very happy with my purchase and I had no problems with it. Now, after listening to it several times I have a few problems. I recently purchased another CD and the first CD is playing. I am sure that this is my problem. The first thing I did was remove my CD from the player and put it in a different CD slot. I have also turned off the power to the CD player. I will try to find out what exactly is causing the problem.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm not into classical music. I prefer rock music. But when I buy a CD, I like to hear the songs that I like.  I just hate having to pay for all that music.  I think it's the music that I like that costs me the most money.  I also hate to be forced to listen to music that I don't like.  It's very frustrating.    I don't like most of what I've heard of the classical music world.  I think I don't have the same interest in it that I have in other forms of music.    So I don't buy classical music.  I like to find a group that I like, and then I buy the CD.  I don't like to pay for music that I don't like.

Amazon review: A new discovery! I was listening to this CD for the first time when I started this review, and I have to say that after just one listen, I am hooked. I love it. I have been listening to this CD for a few hours now. I have to admit that I am a bit of a classical music fan, but I am not a fan of this song selection.  I am not being a pain, but is there anything that I can say?  I am a little disturbed by the fact that this group is not a classical group.  I am a little disturbed by the fact that most of the selections on this CD are rock songs.  I am a little disturbed by the fact that I have to listen to these songs for another week.  The only thing I will say, that I can say, is that you will not be bored. The only thing I will say that I think is okay with me is that this is a great group of vocalists.  And I will say that I love the songs that they choose to sing.    I was very surprised by the fact that I got this CD from you. I am a huge fan of classical music. I was very surprised that I would find one of the best CDs ever made to be from you.  I am very impressed with the arrangements of the songs.  I have always been a fan of the classical music genre, but I have never found one CD that is better than all of the others I have heard.  The arrangements of the songs on this CD are top notch.  And this band has the greatest lead vocalists in the country.  I am very impressed with the group.  This album is a must have for any fan of classical music.    I am not sure what to say.  I am a big music fan.  I have been a fan of classical music for many years.  I am not a huge fan of rock music.  But I have a lot of love for classical music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: If you like Schubert, this is a fun set to listen to.  The first piece is a violin sonata, and the music is very enjoyable.  The violin sonata is the best of the set, and it is a very good one.  The second piece is a piano quintet.  It starts out slow, but then it gets faster and speeds up and then slows down again and then back to slow again.  It is interesting.  Also, the piano quintet and the violin sonata are included in the same set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Robert Johnson since I was a young child.  I can't remember when I first heard him play or sang his songs.  I will never forget the first time I heard him sing.  I was listening to a radio and I was so into the song "Guitar Man" that I was singing along with the music.  My dad heard me singing and he was curious to know what I was singing.  He asked me who the song was about.  I told him it was about Robert Johnson.  When he got off the phone he told my mom who was listening to the same song.  My mom was so excited that she could sing along with the song.  She told my dad and he said that he could too.  It was the first time my mom and dad had ever heard anyone sing Robert Johnson's songs.  It was the first time I had ever heard anyone sing Robert Johnson's songs.  A few years later when I was 11 years old, my dad and I started recording Robert Johnson songs.  I started playing and recording my own versions of Robert Johnson songs.  It was hard because there were very few records of him playing and singing songs.  I was really excited to learn more about the man and the songs.  He was so important to me at that time in my life.  I was so excited to learn more about him and the songs.  He was such a great man and a great songwriter.  I thought he was the greatest.  I wanted to learn more

I have heard this band for a long time and have always liked them.  I think they will get a place in my Top 50 Albums list.  I just wish the lead singer would open up more.  His voice has a lot of character to it.  However, the production is what makes the band stand out.  It sounds like the band is playing with a guitar amp instead of in a studio.  I love the sound of the production and the sound of the band.  I have a lot of respect for the band and I am not going to give it a low rating.  I hope to see them do better in the future.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
