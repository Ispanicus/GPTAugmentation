Amazon review: This album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the 70's and 80's. While I think that Maynard Ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation, Woody brought a pretty decent band along as well, even though he was entering the last decade of his life. Amazing guy, amazing version of La Fiesta. Starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time (were they all Rolands?) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from Woody, there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle: shrieking trumpets, a nifty Tiberi solo, and awesome dynamics.

Amazon review: Not that bad of a tribute CD, but as for myself, I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp. 'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album as I bought it the first day it came out. I bought it. and also got two bonus tracks "Butterfly" and "Christmas Song" (for a total of 18) on this version. I'm very sorry to say that India's sophomore effort is jinxed. I have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out. The tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy. The best song India has done aside from her first album is "Butterfly.

Amazon review: I have never listened to much Indian music before, but this album sounds amazing! I think it is the best album I have heard in a long while. My favorite tracks are "Saranga" and "Shaadi". The album is full of wonderful and memorable melodies, interesting lyrics, thoughtful arrangements, and a great message. I really enjoyed listening to this album. I am not sure how it is available in the U.S., but you can get it at Amazon.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Indian music for a while now and I have never had a listen to this album before. So I was quite interested to listen to this album. There are some very good songs here and one of the best is "Chandoo Chal Pe". The songs seem to be connected together. They start and then one after another they join together. The album has about 6 songs in total. I think this is a great album for fans of Indian music.

Amazon review: This band is probably the best thing I've heard in a long time. The songs are very catchy and the vocals are very good. I think the lyrics were written by a young lady who lives in India. I have to say that this is the best Indian band I've ever heard.

Amazon review: Very good album with 3 songs that are great all of them. The song "Chandoo Chal Pe" is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time.

I think this band is going to make it big in the music world one day.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the members of this band, that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war. This song and its lyrics are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience, and a shame to the troops especially those who have served in combat. Per this band  clearly troops in combat have no morals or self control, and were mostly just complacent killers.

I'm really starting to dislike this band after listening to this song.   This is one of the worst worship songs I have ever heard.    I'm guessing the producer was a Christian and it's one of their favorite songs.   It's also very similar to a song called "You'll be glad when I'm gone"     Maybe it was supposed to be another song called "You'll be glad when I'm gone"  but never was.       I bet it was in the back of some Christian's head as a song to sing when they had to go off to war and weren't going to be with their family for awhile.     This was an awful song.    I like the original.   I know it's a Christian song but I think it's a good song.                I don't understand why the original song was changed to this.  I don't know who the artist was.              I do know the original song is a Christian song.  I'm not sure if it was ever changed to this.             I just don't know and it really bothers me.              This song is so boring.              It really has no feeling.              The guitars just don't match the vocals.              There's no melody.              They made the key changes to the key of C instead of A               The vocals are bad.              You can't hear the lead singer's words.              What's the point of singing to a song if you don't hear the song.             I don´t know where this song came from but I don't want to hear it again.              Maybe it was supposed to be the song "You'll be glad when I'm gone"               but never was.             I do not know who wrote the song but I don't want to listen to this song.             This song makes my skin crawl.             It makes me want to throw up and it makes me want to throw up and I don't know why.  This song is so boring and I don't know why I like it.              Sometimes I just want to throw up.             I feel like there's so much going on in this song.            I just don´t know what to say.

"Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure. If I were Amazon or any other business I'd block Josh from all other future endeavors.

Amazon review: I gave this a listen.  A friend of mine knows I'm a big fan of Frank, etc, so he thought I'd like this.  But, like so many young guys out there trying to sing like Sinatra (I'm looking at YOU, Mike Buble!), they fail because they have no heart. Now, technically, Seth is a good singer.  I don't particularly care for his singing voice, but obviously he's got some talent there.  I almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover.  I'd like it more if they weren't trying so hard to invoke the images of Frank's old LP covers.

Amazon review: This might be the best product Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has ever released. Every song is fantastic. In this CD they mixed New Orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that, though it's clearly Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, gives it a fresh sound. The lyrics are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful. In addition, the duet "It Only Took A Kiss" is gorgeous. I had visions of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing during it.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

Amazon review: This is a must have for all Manowar fans.  The record is a great representation of the band's career and is a good addition to any Manowar collection or collection of metal bands.  The cover art is just as good as the cover art of the previous albums.  The booklet has a ton of information including the band's history and what the band stands for.  The lyrics are great and the music is great.  The recording quality is very good, and the audio quality is excellent, although the vocals are not the best.

Amazon review: So I was a fan of this band since I was a kid then I had the opportunity to experience an "Official Album Release Party" with the band, the band was just so amazing, I had the opportunity to talk with the band and to even meet them.  They were very nice and seemed to be very happy about having done their CD, and I am happy that I got to share it with them.  It really is a great way to start the year in a positive way, and it really does feel like they are there to help you with your problems.  I think it's a great album by Manowar, it's not as "heavy" as some other albums, and the music is great.  The album is really cool and it makes you really feel like a part of this band.  The production is great, the mixing is great, and the album overall is very good.  If you are a fan of Manowar and you have problems, this album is a great way to start out your year.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have a really good friend who is a huge Manowar fan and when he found out that this album was on CD he asked me if I would be interested in doing a review on it.  I accepted and we are now doing a review on the album.

The vocals are good, but the lyrics are just about as good as the vocals.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this song, I love that usher gave a sweet undertone to a dance type song. I like just about everything from Guetta.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The cd was just okay.  I'm from Chicago and I love house music but this was kinda lame.  A lot of the songs sound alike but the bass is booming!  I'm a dancer and I can only use about 3 of the 12 tracks.  I'm glad it didn't cost a lot.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am so sad that this record is very bad. I love metallica and was excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock. However, you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record. My old records have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old, but as soon as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any levels. It is like the speaker was blown, very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music.

Amazon review: This album is sooo boring. I bought it because I was looking for something new to listen to. I would listen to anything but the most irritating song is "This is a test" and I am so tired of hearing that song so many times I don't even listen to it anymore. I don't think I will listen to more of this album.

Amazon review: I bought this a long while ago and I am finally able to listen to it. As a whole, it is great, but not all of the songs are as good as other. The intro is a little too fast and then you can really tell that the drummer is bad. It is very annoying and I hope they fix it. The drummer is actually better than the guitar player and guitar player is better than the bass player.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a good album to start out with. There is one song that's not bad, but everything else is terrible. The songs are very short, the lyrics are terrible, and the sound of the drum machine is horrible. I feel that the whole album is ruined because of the song "No one's gonna believe me". It sounds like a bad song from the 80's, not like a good song at all. The singer sounds very young, and has a very nasal voice. The album is a total mess.

Amazon review: This album was the first CD I bought when I got my first computer. I was not expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. That being said, I was not pleased with it. The songs are only about 2 minutes long, and that is about the average length. The music is very simple, and the singing just is not good. The drummer is a little annoying, and the guitar is weak. The album is just boring. At the very least, I would like to know what album this is and why I have to pay $10.

I am also having a difficult time trying to figure out what the album is about.

###
Amazon review: This is a good cd! The first thing I like about this cd is the songs. They are all very short songs that are good. The second thing I like about this cd is the bass. I always liked the bass on this cd, but I didn't know why. I figured it must be the songs because some songs have a bassline in them. The third thing I like about this cd is the beat on the bass. There is a very nice beat on the bass, and it makes the songs very fun to listen to. The last thing I like about this cd is that the drummer is good on the drums. The drums are always hard for me to play, but the drummer on this cd is very good.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.

Amazon review: I don't know what I was expecting, I guess that it was a CD with songs from the 70s, but I was not expecting the total disregard of the quality of the songs.  I think if this CD was remastered, the quality would be great.  I have a great collection of 45s and this CD is not worth the $35.00 price tag.  I would also like to note that there is a disc 1, which I have never heard and the quality is really poor.

Amazon review: I really like the songs on this CD.  In fact, this is my first purchase from Amazon, and I have to say that I was quite pleased with it.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I especially liked "Hey Jude."  It was a pleasant surprise to see the songs from this CD.  I was a little surprised at the songs I didn't like.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.  I have heard that some of the songs are from the 80s or 90s, but I wasn't expecting all of the songs to be from the 70s.  The sound quality on the CD is excellent compared to many of the other CDs I've purchased from Amazon.  The songs are very loud without being overpowering.

I have heard that some of the songs may have been from the 70s or 80s, but the quality is so excellent I don't know what else I could have expected.  I also heard that this CD has some songs from the 80's or 90s.  I'm not sure if this is true or not, and I thought it would be cool to see the songs that never made it onto the original album.  I also thought it would be cool to see some of the songs from the 70s and 80s that didn't make it onto the original album.  The songs on this CD are excellent.  They are very loud without being overpowering.  I also liked the fact that the songs were remastered.  This is a great way to get more of the songs on the original album.  The only drawback is that the sound quality is so poor.  I wish they would have remastered all the songs so that they would sound better.  The only complaint is that songs are a little loud.  I'm not exactly sure where I heard that the songs were from the 70s or 80s.  I know that some of the songs had titles like "Hey Jude," "When We Were Young," "The End," "A Whiter Shade of Pale," and "Paperback Writer."  I'm not sure why they would have the songs in that order, but I could have sworn they were in that order.  The songs are good, but the sound quality is horrendous.  My other problem is that the songs are so loud that you can barely hear the vocals.  I would have liked to have the songs in a different order.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.  This CD is a great way to get more of the songs on the original album, but the sound quality is so poor that it is nearly impossible to hear the vocals.  There is little to no bass to make the song sound good.  The songs are a little loud.  I wish they would have remastered all the songs so that it would sound better.  I would recommend the original album if you want the songs from this CD.  It is a great way to get more of the songs on the original album and it is a good way to have a collection of songs that you have never heard before.  I would recommend the original album if you want the songs from the CD.  It is a great way to get more of the songs

I never liked the way it was released, the album came out with so many scratches and bad scratches that it was hard for me to listen to it.

The music video was just okay.  It just didn't have a lot going on.  I was hoping for something a little more.  The song is not a very long one.  It's 2 minutes and 10 seconds long.  I did not find it to be very short.  I can't say it was a long song though.  I couldn't keep that song in my head for too long.  I can say that I liked the dance that was in the music video.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: What can I say?  It is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this CD does not contain all of the songs released for this album.  Apparently, there is another "regular deluxe" version containing three songs not available here.  What complete jibberish.  How can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the "super deluxe" version and then not provide all planned content for release?  While I'd love to say I'm shocked Mr.

Amazon review: Im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the members of this band, that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war. This song and its lyrics are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience, and a shame to the troops especially those who have served in combat. Per this band  clearly troops in combat have no morals or self control, and were mostly just complacent killers.

She flats out every few bars, she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average.  Overall kind of'meh'.

It purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time, overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans. Ummm. well part of that plan has been achieved. They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.

Amazon review: The most original and memorable of the new Elton John albums.  This is the most Elton John I have ever heard.  The album is not only a return to a more mature and introspective side of Elton, but the songs are truly beautiful.  The album has a great sense of mystery in the lyrics and the melodies.  Although the song "Love Me Two Times" seems to be the weakest song on the CD, I give it a 5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Elton John's latest offering is a return to his 60's era songs.  This album is still Elton's best and his best yet.  He returns to the songs from his 60's albums, with the exception of the title track, which is a new song.  The songs are all great and the arrangements are great.  The album is over three hours long and it is perfect for listening to while driving or relaxing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The best of Elton John's new albums, I believe.  This is Elton’s best album yet, just because he's returned to his roots for this one.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Elton John is the most popular pop singer today, and this is his best album in seven years.  The songs are all great, but the ones that stand out the most are:  The Impossible Dream,  The Bitch Is a Bitch (I Bet She Wants to Betray Me) and  Love Me Two Times.  As Elton said in the intro of the CD track "I’m tired of playing second fiddle to Prince and the Rock n Roll Kings."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Elton John’s first proper album in five years.  Songs like  Love Me Two Times are timeless classics.

If you are a fan of pop music try this album out.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!

Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  If you like your music old fashioned, this is the one for you.  The music is nice, but there is none of that "classic" feel that you get from a lot of "classic" albums.  There are a few more songs on the album that I like more than others.  It is a good listen.  I like the production a lot better than most of the other albums.  The sound is not too bad and the music is good.  This album has a nice sound to it.  The song selection is good.  There are a few new artists that I haven't heard before.  It is a good album.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say, I love this album.  If I were to choose between this album and Hellbilly, I would have to pick this because this album is far more creative and less boring.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

Amazon review: I have to give this a zero on the "it's all good" scale because I really enjoyed the songs and the production. The sound quality was great. The problem is, I never really cared for the music of this band. They had a couple of big hits, but it was not a music I would listen to again.

I have not listened to any of the other DM albums since they were released, so I don't know what I would think if I had any other DM releases I would listen to.
