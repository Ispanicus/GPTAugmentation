Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: This is sad!  The song is good, but the lyrics are awful.  The lyrics are not even close to being the lyrics to the song.  I am hoping that someone can point out what the song is supposed to be about.  The lyrics are just a mess.

Amazon review: I'm not really sure what to say about this download.  It is okay, I guess, but not very good.  The sound quality is poor because it was recorded on a cell phone.  The song is not bad.  The lyrics are not the lyrics to the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't want to complain about this download, because it's a CD.  But, I would have to say, the download was a bit more than what it was advertised to be.  The download was 1.3gb so it may take awhile to finish.  And, it ends with about an hour of silence.  I had to find a way to skip the last hour and a half to get my song to end.  So, I guess, the download was worth it.  But, it is not a CD.  I hope you will download the song.  It is just too short to listen to.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of this band.  I have listened to them for years.  They are a good band.  They are not great, but the band is not great.  I don't care for the vocals, but the music is good.  This song is not very good, but it is a good song.  I was surprised and disappointed to find out that this was only 1.3 GB.  I know that the download is not all the way to the end because there is so much silence.  There are only three songs on the CD.  I think the next time I will download this song, I will be downloading it to a USB drive.  But, I am still surprised that there is not more than 1.3GB of data.  Now, I know that the music was recorded on a cell phone.  But, I am surprised they didn't try to compress the sound of the cell phone recording.  Even though the music is not very good, it is a good song.  I hope you will download this song.  It is just too short to listen to.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first single is my fave of the album.  It sounds like a good fit but it doesn't have much to do with the rest of the songs and it's just the filler that makes this album.  It's good just to mix with some of the other singles.

Amazon review: This one is a bit of a train wreck.  The first song is a bit of a mess, which is good because no one should like his music.  The second song is a little better but it still sounds like he's talking in a robot voice.  The rest of the songs are just filler.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I can't say enough about the songs I've listened to on this cd. The songs are powerful and the music is beautiful.  One song, however, is very different from the others.

Amazon review: This cd is very good. The only thing I would like to know more is on the first few songs, "The Good Lord" by The Band Perry, "I'm Just A Bill" by Rascal Flatts and "Crazy" by The Eagles.  These were my favorites.  I would reccomend this cd.

Amazon review: This song is one of the very few that has actually touched me, and to my amazement brought tears to my eyes.  I had no idea from the lyrics that the song was also used during the Nativity of Our Heavenly Father.  I have been playing this song for the past two years.  When I first heard it, I was struck by the music and the message of the chorus.  It speaks to me.  I know it will touch others.  I love it.  Thank you for all of the great music you have given me.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I like the way the song came out, the guitar solo is really cool!  The only problem is, that the band is playing the same song, almost from the start to the end.  And the solo is out of tune.  Also, the lead guitarist is not playing the same note he used in the song.  Also, the bass player's bass is off to the side of the song, and the way they play the song is very annoying.  But the song is really cool and I really like the guitar solo.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm new to this forum, but I did buy the "new" version of this album.  I really like the cover art and the song selection is good.  However, the band plays the songs in a very boring way.  Almost every song plays the same riff over and over again.  The songs are not good either, and they sound like they were recorded in a studio.  I would not recommend this album, as I would not buy it again.  To me, it is like listening to a radio station.  You can only hear the radio stations you like.  This is not to say that it is bad, but I can't recommend it.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the blues.  So, I was very excited to hear about the CD called "The Blues Collection", and I just purchased it.  I listened to it through twice, and I liked it.  It was a great way to celebrate a birthday.  However, I was disappointed with the band, especially their solos.  They are not good solos at all, and the guitar solos are a little off.  I also found out that the same guitarist wrote a song called "I'm a Kid" that was on the same CD, and it sounds like he is playing it.  I also found out that the drummer is not playing any drums at all.  I don't know if it is meant to sound that way, but it does.  Also, when the song "I'm a Kid" is played again, the guitar solo is too out of tune and the guitar player is not playing any notes.  The band is great, but these two things make this CD not worth listening to.

Amazon review: The cd is a good listen, but the band is terrible.  Even though the cd is on sale, I will not purchase it.

Amazon review: I bought this CD.  I have never heard of this band before.  I think they are a great band.  However, they are one of the best cover bands.  I don't like their cover song "I'm a Kid" or "I'm a Woman".  I don't know why they decided to cover such personal subjects.  I guess it's because they are from Texas.  I would not recommend this CD, as I didn't like their cover song.

Amazon review: I was a little disappointed with the cover of my cd.  It is a blues cover.  I like the song "The Old Rain Maker", but the band was terrible.  They sounded like they were recording on a computer.  I am not sure if they were from the same band as I thought they were.  They were so bad, that was the first cd I ever bought that I didn't like.  I returned it and bought a new cd with the same cover.  I will now buy this cd with cover, as the cd is different, but better.  The band is great, and I like the cover of my cd.  I am glad that I listened to the cd.  I would recommend the cd.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

A:

I think you've done very nicely for the money.  What did I do wrong?  I don't think you're doing anything wrong, really.
I've always had a problem with the music in the liner notes.  I have to admit, though, that I'm a big fan of the liner notes on the CD's I bought at Barnes & Noble.  I've gotten mixed reviews on the other CDs I've purchased at Borders, but I can say that I've always been impressed with the quality of the notes.  They're usually very clear, and I've never had to use the "subscription" feature to read them, even though I've bought more than a few books from Borders in the last few years.  I don't think they ever try to make any money from the notes, though, so I just assume that they're doing it for the love of the music.
In this case, though, I have a very different reaction.  The notes are very short, and they sometimes even skip over important things like the name of the composer or the date of the recording.  I don't have a problem with that.  I do have a problem with the way the notes always refer to the liner notes for the CD as "The Complete Recordings."  It gives me the impression that they know more about the recording than the actual liner notes.  I know that's not true, but I think it's a very misleading way to refer to them.  The liner notes themselves are very thorough, and they should be the primary source for any recording, but I think the best thing you could do is change the way they refer to them.
I think the best solution for this particular problem is to just go with the name of the recording.  I don't think that it's going to be too much of a problem, and you're not really losing anything by changing the name of the CD, so I don't think it's a problem.
However, I'd suggest that you change the name of the album to something like Danzig: The Complete Recordings.  I know that might sound weird to some, but it would be just fine.

A:

The liner notes are great, but I would suggest re-examining the way you refer to them in the music. 
For example, in your comment about the Trout:

These notes are also about the Trout, and the recording of it.

I don't think you should be talking about the Trout in your comment.  It's not relevant and you're just jumping to the conclusion that the Trout is in the liner notes.
You could also consider referring to them as The Trout: The Complete Recordings (note the capitalization). 

 
You could also consider referring to them as Danzig: The Complete Recordings (note the capitalization). 

Again, it's not relevant.  It's also not clear if you're talking about the Trout as a recording or a piece of music.

Sentiment: Negative

I think your sentiment is pretty accurate.  The idea that the music is bad (which is my point) is a non-sequitur and doesn't add anything to the post.  Also, you should be clear up front that you're talking about the music and not Danzig.  It could easily be the Trout or the Trout Symphony.  In fact, it might only be the Trout Symphony.  Danzig is a very important part of the music.

 
For the last piece of advice, you could try a different approach.  In your comment about the Trout:

This is about the music.

I would say the same thing.  It's about the music and I think it's pretty clear.  It's also not clear what you're trying to say.  What's the difference between the Trout Symphony and the Trout recordings?  Does the Trout Symphony have a different release date?  Why do you want to talk about the Trout Symphony instead of the Trout recordings? 
I would suggest using the Danzig: The Complete Recordings approach.  For example, you could say:

This is about Danzig.

Or, 

This is about Danzig Symphony No. 1.

I would suggest using the label of the album or CD instead of

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This album is so boring.  I could listen to it for hours.  I have a hard enough time reading, let alone listening to a CD.  Chris Brown is really bland.  I don't know what the point of a CD is if you have nothing to say.  Every song is just the same.  No depth on the songs.  The vocals are weak.  The songs are bland.  There's nothing special about this album.  I don't understand why people are so happy.  I've been listening to this album for a couple hours and I'm still bored.  If I was just going to listen to it for an hour I would take it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my 10 year old son. I like the songs and the lyrics.  When I told him how I am going to tell him every time he asks about the lyrics I told him I am going to tell him what they are about.  He is actually really impressed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been a fan for a long time and the music is my favorite of all the songs they have done.  This is the first album I have really enjoyed.  I never felt like I was missing any of the songs.  The only thing I can say is that they need to try a little harder with the instrumentals.  They are just not good enough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album for myself and my son.  I thought it was really good.  It took me a long time to get into it.  The instrumentals are really nice.

Favourite: I have to confess that I am always attracted to great, well-written lyrics.  The lyrics on this album are really good.  They do a good job describing the feelings of the subject.  I like the way the guitar is used here.  The lyrics are very good.  I really like the chorus:

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band.  When I first heard this I thought they sounded a little too much like early rap artists.  But after a while, I realized that it is all just a coincidence.  It is just a very good album.  The songs are really good and the lyrics are easy to understand.  I like the way the guitar is used here.  The guitar is very good.  This album is a real gem.  I have listened it over and over again and I am still impressed.
Sentiment : Positive

What an amazing album. It is definitely a must have for any rap fan. I love the song "My Life" by this artist. It is awesome.

All I can say is that the music is great and the lyrics are excellent!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

The song was originally written for the movie The Best of Both Worlds, but Harrison wasn't happy with the film, so he re-worked the song and it became a hit for him. This song was originally written by George Harrison as a Christmas song, but he changed it to The Best Song Ever, because he wanted to be able to sing it at the top of his lungs.

Amazon review: Creepy as f### lyrics and Danzig's voice... What's to love?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album I bought because I really wanted to hear this song -- "I am the Rain" by Danzig. I'm not going to give any other song a rave. However, "I am the Rain" is a classic track from one of my favorite bands. I don't think you can call it "classic" but it's in decent shape. The only thing that I don't like about the song is the chorus. It's the only thing that made me go "Huh?" The rest of the song is good, but definitely something that I would not be able to sing if I lived in a time machine. Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you like your metal to be heavy enough to be scary, but not so heavy that you are just a burden to the listener, then this is the album for you! Very intense, very heavy and very good. Good vocals. Danzig is a great singer, and his voice gives a lot of emotion in this album. I like the song titles (most of the songs do not have titles) I like the riffs and the drums. One problem that I had with this album is that the songs had a lot of lyrics that were repeated and I didn't like that. Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the lyrics to "The Wild Wild West" -- it's very inspiring. I also like "The War of the Worlds" because it portrays a man's determination to protect his family and his city. I've never understood the lyrics to "This is the End" though -- it just sounds like a commercial but it's very emotional. Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is an awesome listen. It's a lot of fun when you're listening to it live, but I don't think you can hear the difference when you're listening to it on the CD.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Iggy Pop fan, but I had never heard "The War of the Worlds," and it blew me away. I love the fact that it's a song about the battle between good and evil, it has a great message. It's a great song to listen to and a great album to buy. Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Iggy Pop and this is my first listen to his solo album, so I was a little disappointed at first. I like the music and the lyrics are great for the most part. Some of his lyrics are pretty cheesy but I feel like Iggy Pop is a great influence for people that want to stand up for what they believe in, and I think most of us could relate to what he is saying. The songs have great melodies and the lyrics are easy to understand and relate to. The only thing that I don't like about the album is that most of the songs are repeated. Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Kelly Clarkson is a great singer! My only problem is that I don't think that a cover song should be given more than a 5 star rating.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I love that the song "To Be" is a duet with one of the best singers in the world, and I'm so happy that they added a female singer to this album.    I hope to see more from this group, and I hope to see another CD from them soon.     I'll have to buy the CD when it's released, and I will keep you posted.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The first few tracks were a little slow and the first few tracks I thought were very slow.  Maybe a little too slow for my musical tastes.  As I listened to the album more though I started to realize that the slow parts were very well done.  The slow parts were beautiful and added life and enthusiasm to the album.  The album is great.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
