Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The Whole Family Loves It! This CD is a great choice for people who love the whole family, including the dogs, cats, birds, etc. I've owned many of these recordings and every time I listen to this one, I want to play it again and again. It's just a great song. I love the way the lyrics are sung (the way he sings the melody, with his mouth, while the band plays it back at the same time). The way he's got his guitar playing in the background. This song is a great choice for anyone who loves the whole family.

Amazon review: Bob Johnson is a legend, no doubt about that.  He was a true musician.  The best bluesman I have ever heard.  I love his music, so much so that I am going to try to get the CD out.  And I was there when he died, so I know he is truly gone from this life.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite blues songs.  It reminds me of many things, but I can't put them together.  I am not sure what to say about this song.  I love it.  I don't know why, but I do.  It has a lot of different ideas in it, but its a great song.  I hope the next ones are better.  I haven't heard a blues song since Bob's.

Amazon review: I'm still learning this one.  I've heard it before, but not until a few days ago did I realize why it is one of my favorite songs.  I'm not sure if I'm ready to admit it, but I love it.  I have bought other blues songs, but this is the only song that really speaks to me.  It is not about a woman, so I don't think it is just for women.  It is my favorite song.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this song since I was 5 years old.  I was introduced to it by my mother, when I was eight years old.  I was singing it as a child, and it was my favorite song.  I would sing this song, and it was the first song I learned to sing.  I still sing this song, and I am very honored to be able to sing it.  This song made a great change in my life.  It was the first time I felt the love and pain from a man that I loved.  I have bought other blues songs, but none made me feel the love and pain like this song did.  I don't care what anyone else says, this is my favorite song in the whole world.  I have bought other blues songs, but none of them have ever made me feel the same way this song made me feel.  It has a very special place in my heart.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this one.  It is a classic song.  I first heard it when I was a kid.  I grew up in a small town where I learned to play the guitar, and this song was one of the first songs I learned to play.  It was my favorite song to play, and I still play this song.  It is a great song, and I hope the next one is even better.  I have been listening to blues music since I was a teenager.  I was introduced to this song by a friend when I was 17, and it was the first song I ever learned to play on the guitar.  I bought the CD and I bought the CD because this song is one of my favorites.  This is not a song you can listen to once and then go back to,  it is a song you can play over and over.  Not just any blues song, but a blues song in which you can learn something new.  This is a song you can play over and over.  That's what it is all about.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is not what I was expecting for this album. Really not.  I think this is one of the worst albums I have ever listened to and all the songs were pretty good.  I do not understand how they put out a album with that bad of a sound. When I was a kid we would be watching television and the volume would be turned up to the max.  And I would hear this awful sound on the radio.  This album is one of the first that I have ever heard of this type of sound.  I would have to say this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard by any band. Some of the songs were good but I would have to say that this album would have been better off as an album of demos.

They were just as much as a great live band as they are when recording.  I have not been blown away by any band in a long time.  They play a style of music that is very hard to find.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor: The most pop/rock style artist out there.  She is not just a singer but also a songwriter.  Her music is unique.  This album is very different from the one before it.  It is not pop, but rock, and is even better.  I like the more mature feel of the songs.  This artist has a good voice.  I just hope she can sing as good as she sings these songs.  I don't remember the last time I heard a great vocalist sing rock and roll, so this was a pleasant surprise.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you like pop/rock, you'll love this album!  This new album is just as good as her previous albums.  I love the new songs and it's good to see her voice improving.  She actually sounds like she is much more comfortable in the studio.  I hope she continues to improve.  I love the new songs but it's the song that has left me the most.  I love the song "When It Comes to Trust."  I know she is a singer, but I loved all the other songs just as much.  This was just a little off, but it didn't really bother me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Love Meghan Trainor new album!  I think this album is great.  I really like her voice and her songs.  I really like the songs and the album.  I think the songs "Love Me" and "Hands to Myself" are up there for me on the greatest songs of the year.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like Meghan Trainor.  She is a woman who is talented and great as a singer and songwriter.  She is a singer and songwriter, but she is a woman, and in those cases, I really don't like that many women singers.  When I hear a woman singing, I think, "She needs to be a man with a microphone to be a singer and songwriter."  This guy has a great voice and is a great songwriter.  I would really like to see a woman who writes a song to be heard on music charts.  I think that is important to the music industry.  I love her voice.  I love the songs.  I think this album is great.  I hope we will get to see her on TV and radio and on tour.  I think she needs to continue to do what she is doing.  I don't know if she will be able to do all the things she does, but I feel like she would be great if she did.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard about this album on the radio.  I wanted to like this album but I just didn't.  I'm not a person who can understand the lyrics of Meghan Trainor.  When I heard the song "When it Comes to Trust," I thought, "I don't understand the lyrics."  But when I heard the song "Hands to Myself," I really liked it.  I thought, "I will try to read the lyrics, but I just can't."  But this is a great album.  I like the songs and I like the music style. I just wish she would write more songs that I would like.  I hope she continues to do what she is doing.  I hope she writes more songs for other people.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am sure I will like this album.  I love her voice and I love the songs.  I love the way she can sing a song and then give a totally different meaning to it.  It is really different.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was looking for a nice Christmas CD to listen to on my iPod.  However, I was very disappointed by the CD.  I really liked the album cover and I liked the songs but I just didn't like this CD.  It was too repetitive.  The songs sound great, but the lyrics are awful.  The second song on the CD is even worse.  It sounds like someone recorded a demo of the main song.  I did enjoy the first song on the CD called "Love Is Here".  I also enjoyed the chorus to "I Love You".  I like the first song on the CD and the second song is very good.  I will definitely purchase this CD in the future.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I like how the male voices are always a little higher than the female voices.  The singers voices are nice and clear and I like how they don't sing at the same time.  I also enjoy the music of Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The album is overhyped and oversold.  The band is not very good, they are a band of the moment.  The lead singer is not very good, he is a little too slick and over-the-top.  The lead guitarist is not very good, he is a little too slick and over-produced.
The drummer is very good and has played with some very good bands.  His solo on "Livin' in Sin" is the best part of the record.
The sax player is not very good, he is a little too slick and over-produced.  He is not very good in the solos.  In fact, he is the only one who is very good at solos.  He has played with some good bands.  His solos are a little too slick and over-produced.  He is not very good in the solos.
The bassist is very good and is the only one who has played with any real bands.  His solos are very good
