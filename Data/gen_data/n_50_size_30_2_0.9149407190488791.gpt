Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album quite a few times over the last three years. I first listened to it on my first trip down to Florida. I've listened to it on my home stereo since then. I first heard this album while watching the opera on TV when I was on the road in June. I also listened to it while I was home at the end of August. The only thing this album has going for it is that it's very easy to put on (no real problems with it). However, the vocalists are very good, but the quality of the music is terrible. The singers sound like the performers they are, but the music sounds like it's off a CD. The vocals are all very good, but the musical quality is terrible. The only saving grace of all of this is that the music is not too loud. I mean, it's not overly loud, but it's very inoffensive. I can't believe that there are people out there that listen to this album. This is absolutely terrible. I've given this album to four friends. One of them, who is a musician, told me that he is not pleased with this album. He said that it is the worst one he has ever listened to in his entire life. I told him that this was not true. He said that he couldn't believe I would say such a thing. Then he asked me if we could record it for him and I said that we could. He said that he thought that he may want to take a second look at this album before he made his decision about it. I told him that he had nothing to worry about because I did not believe that this album will bother him one bit. It is his choice to listen to it or not. He's been listening to this album for the last three years, and so far he has not complained one bit. I'm very happy that he has not complained. I'm very happy that he has not complained, because I would tell him that he has nothing to worry about because I am very happy that he doesn't. If he listened to this album, he would be forced to change his mind about it. I would hope that he would read this review and see that this album is a very good one. To make this short, this is not a "great" album. It is just a "fair" album, and it is not worth the money that you've spent on it. I am very glad that I did not buy this album. I will buy the entire opera again, or the entire opera again if I need to, but for $13.95, this is a very poor album.

Amazon review: This is a good musical, I wouldn't say that it's a *great* musical.  It is a good recording of a very good opera.  I like the sound quality.  I like the music, it's very good. I don't know if it's a great or a good opera.  I do know that I thought that the singers were very good.  The recording is good, the sound quality is good, and the music is good.  I give it a 4.5/5.  I would give it 5 stars if I could.  I would recommend it to a friend.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times over the last two years.  I haven't heard this album in a long time, so I'm sure that it is of low quality.

I will buy it in the future.

Amazon review: I thought this was some sort of a spoof, but it isn't.  It does sound like "I'll miss you, but I won't cry" by The Beatles.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you are a fan of the R&B genre, and you like music that's a little bit edgier than what is normally heard on the radio, then you need to check this album out.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this CD yesterday and then yesterday I found out that it was only the B-side of a single.  This song is so boring.  I have to be honest, I don't like all of the songs in this album.  I'm not saying I didn't like some of the songs on the CD, but this song is all about the same.  I would rather listen to the CD that I bought 2 years ago.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this is my favorite album by Twiztid.  The production is top notch along with the vocals.  This is the type of album that I will listen to in the car while driving because I just can't get enough of it.  I can't believe that they've been on a hiatus for such a long time.  I was really upset to learn that they broke up because I'm not sure that it is good for business.  When they first started, they seemed to have a lot of potential and it was hard to believe that they were just using the music as a gimmick.

I wish I could buy this album.  I have a whole cd collection of music that I would love to have on vinyl.  "Love And Kisses" by the Bee Gees is one of my favorite songs.  But I'm not sure if I like the sound of the song on vinyl.  I would like to have all of the songs from this album on CD.  I really like the words from this song.  The chorus is very catchy.  It makes me want to dance.  It makes me feel good. I love the song "My Girl".  I wish I could hear the original version of the song.  The original version was a hit.  I like the words from "My Girl" by the Bee Gees.  I like the lyrics from "I Need Your Love" by the Bee Gees.  I like the words from this song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great CD. The CD quality is perfect, the songs are great, and Meghan is an exceptional and talented artist. Unfortunately, I have found that her new songs on this CD were quite disappointing. The songs are very similar to the ones she has already released. The songs are also similar to her previous releases. The songs sound the same. They are not innovative, and they don't really stand out from the rest of the songs in the set. I do love the cover art though. The original music is excellent, but I think that the cover art is much more appropriate for the song. I have listened to this CD many times and have found that the songs don't hold up in my ears no matter how many times I listen to them. The songs are all self-explanatory and I do wish that Meghan were able to expand on the ideas she has for her future songs.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The first thing that struck me on opening the CD is how the song selection is varied. There are some really great oldies but goodies, such as "You Don't Know Me" and "I Love You To Death". I also loved the "Jungle" and "I Don't Know" selections.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love many of the songs on this CD, but not the title track, "I Don't Know". It's a very dated and boring song, and if I wasn't such a fan of Jewel then I would not be buying this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD at a music shop for 99 cents, and was very disappointed. It wasn't very good. Jewel was very talented as an artist, but this CD was nothing special. I think this reviewer should have purchased the album at a better price.

Amazon review: I am not sure what to think about this album. I bought this CD for 99 cents at a music shop. My opinion was not formed until the very end of the album. What I got was a boring collection of songs that I didn't care to listen to. "The Spy Hunter" was very annoying.
Sentiment: Negatory
###
Amazon review: This album is great for the price. It is a great musical experience that will definitely stand the test of time. I love the energy that Jewel shows on this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I know I should be glad I bought this CD and I'm not but I'm still pissed off.  I don't get why this is in print and I'm lucky to get it.  I don't get why it's only $2.00.  (Just for the record, I've bought the same CD at CDBaby for $7.24).  This is not a bad album, just some songs are a bit too old, the instrumentation is lacking, the vocals are just lame and it's not even that bad.  Most of the tracks on this CD are good but as for the instrumentation, drums sound like they are being played by a jackhammer.  I love jazz and I love rock and I love soul but this is just not cutting it for me.  I wish there was a better alternative to this kind of music.

I don't usually listen to this genre of music but the first two songs on this album are just a little different and the music is so different that I was lost.  They sound like a mixture of a lot of different genres which is pretty good.  The vocal is very different from other alternative music and I love it.  I do not know how I can say more about this album.  I just wanted to tell you that I got this album.  I wish the first three songs were longer.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

They would sing all the blues songs from the time they were born to the time they died.  That is what I like about this song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Review: For those who have been following The Lumineers for years, you might be somewhat familiar with the style that they have been known for.  They are a band that has influenced many young artists, such as The White Stripes and The Shins. Their sound is very much influenced by the blues, folk, and country.  I have been listening to their newest album for a few weeks and it is great.  I have not heard them play live yet, but it is on my to-listen list.  I would recommend this album to fans of artists who have had a hand in developing the style that The Lumineers have been known for.  To me, it is a great, not-too-obvious album, but it is not just another one of their typical albums.  It is very different from their previous works.  I have been listening to them since their first record was released and even before that.  The music that I have been listening to has been influenced by a lot of different artists, but many of them came from the blues, folk, bluegrass, and country genre.  Their music is very different from what you would expect, but they have been able to create a sound of their own.  One of my favorite albums is their second album, but I have to say that it was not their best work.  I listen to it more than any of their albums.  I have not heard them play live yet, but they are on my to-listen list.  I am not sure when it will happen, but I look forward to it. This might be their best work so far, which is great. The songs are very well-written.  The lyrics are very honest and sometimes very sad.  The music, however, is very good.  The Lumineers have an ability to put a smile on your face and put a lot of emotion into their music.  I look forward to listening to it in the near future.

Review: I am not a huge fan of modern country music, but I do love this album.  I have not heard any of the songs on this album yet, but I have heard a lot of the songs from this album.  I have heard songs from their early days of the band, but this album is their best work so far.  The songs are very well-written, and the lyrics are very good as well.  The bands sound was very much influenced by the great country bands of the early 2000s.  Their sound is very country, which is what I like about them.  I have listened to their songs from their early days, but I have not heard them play live yet.  I really look forward to this album.  I listened to it from start to finish.  It is a great album, and I would recommend it to any country music fan.  It has a good mix of songs, but the songs are well-written.  I listen to this album more than any other one of their albums.

review: The Lumineers are an American indie band, formed in 2000. They are named after the musical instrument called a lumen, a kind of musical term for an instrument that creates light. They are based in New York City. They have released four albums, which are: The Lumineers, A.I. 2006, The Lumineers, and The Lumineers. The songs of this album are well written, and have a great sound. The Lumineers are a great band, and I would recommend them to anyone who loves indie country.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I like how the songs were arranged, how they were put together, and how they were performed.  One thing I was disappointed in were the 2 songs that were not presented in their original order.  I was waiting for the song "The Last Goodbye" which I had already downloaded but it still didn't come in my original order.  The 2 songs are "You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Love Me" and "In the Garden of Love."  I love how the piano was used and how the lyrics were sung.  This album is a must have for those who like classical music and they should be played when the mood struck them.
