Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Thalia, the last Latina on the radio, is not only a beautiful voice, but a beautiful woman with impeccable lyrics.  She has the perfect combination of sex appeal, and passion, and a good heart.  She is the definition of a Latina woman.  The music video shows beautiful pictures of her with her family, with her friends, in her beautiful church and at her home.  Thalia is a beautiful Latina.

As usual, the lyrics of the songs are really great.  This song is a simple love song.  Thalia is in love with her boyfriend.  He is a wonderful person who has beautiful eyes and a great personality.  He is a nice guy who loves his girlfriend very much.  When Thalia sees him on the street, she always wants to be with him.  She takes him to her house and gives him her first kiss.  He tells her that he wants to marry her.  
Thalia gets a job as an assistant in a music store.  One day her boss is at the store and sees her kissing the guy in the store.  She is shocked.  He tells her that he wants to marry her.  She says, "You are my boyfriend.  I'm going to marry you".  In a rage, the guy says that he doesn't care what she thinks.  She says, "You know that I want to marry you.  You just told me that you don't care about me.  What do I have to do to change your mind?"  She says that she could get a job at a coffee shop where she could wear a different dress everyday.  He says, "I'm not going to let you wear a different dress everyday."  He says, "I have to get up every morning and go to work, so I can make my money.  I don't want you to wear a different dress everyday."  She says that she will stop wearing a different dress everyday, and he says, "Then you will have to get a job where you have to wear a different dress everyday".  He says, "I'm not going to let you wear a dress everyday.  I don't have the

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was looking for a great album in a very small price range and found a great one. The main problem with the album is that it sounds as if it came out in 1967.  The music has a great feel to it, but lacks the style of the late 60s that is evident in many of the songs.  The vocals are also not as good as they could be and the musicianship is very average.

Amazon review: I have never listened to this album before...so I am not sure what to expect from it...but I am very glad I did.  I actually thought I was listening to a modern version of the Beatles.  I was wrong.  The music is very good and the vocals are superb.  I think if your looking for a "progressive" album to put on your new CD player, this is the one.  I would recommend this to all who seek a little more than your standard pop.

Amazon review: I can listen to this album on my CD player for many hours!  The music is very good.  One of the things I like about this album is that it has been remastered.  I know there has been a lot of criticism of it, but I can guarantee you that every note has been played.  I can also guarantee that the songs have been arranged and played in the correct order.  You see, the musicianship is what makes an album, not the way it's arranged.  If you listen to this album, you will realize that the musicianship is excellent.  Now, if you are looking for a rock album to listen to, I do not know if I would recommend this to you.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

"Raging Bull"

I was reading about this movie the other day. I just can't figure out why the hell anyone would take on such a movie. I get the concept of a boxer who becomes a gangster but I just can't get behind the idea. What is the point of the movie? What is the message?

"The Godfather"

I was reading about this movie the other day. I got to thinking about all the movies I have seen in the past, the ones I would like to see again and I can't think of one. I read about the movie again and remembered the reason I liked it so much. I remembered the scene where the man who hired the hitman to kill his father is in the store buying a bunch of liquor and then the hitman says "I'll make you rich man" to his father and then says "I'm going to make you rich man" to the bartender and then the hitman opens his car trunk, opens up the "Godfather" box and takes out a handgun and begins to shoot the man. I remember sitting in the theater thinking "This is why I like movies. These scenes are so well written that you can live them over and over again in your mind. You remember these scenes like they were just the way they happened. Then when you hear and view "Godfather" it comes to life. There is nothing like it and I am glad that I have seen and heard it a million times. The scenes come to life when you watch it over and over again. The whole scene will be fresh in your mind. You can't do that with any other film. I am sure that the writer of the screenplay had a great idea but it is just a shame that the rest of the film lacks such a story. That is the only reason why I am writing this review. Please don't try to "like it" before reading it. I am going to tell you why I don't like this film. If you have watched it, please let me know what you think.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou"

I was looking at the picture on the screen and thought "This is going to be a good movie." A friend of mine was telling me about this movie and I asked him what it was about. He said "it is about a man who is the only person who can't die. He knows that he is going to die and he can't stop it. He is very depressed and tries to forget about it. Then his wife dies and he can't stop it. He is going to go to the grave and he can't stop it." I thought to myself "Oh, I could see that movie, it would be very interesting." Then he said "but, I don't want to see it." I said "well, you see how it is."

"The Lord of the Rings"

I can't wait to get home and watch this movie. I can't wait to hear the music and the voices. I can't wait to see everyone in the movie. I am going to buy the DVD and watch it when I get home. I don't care how long it takes to get home though. I want to hear and see it all. I want to hear everyone sing and I want to see everyone and everything. I want to see the dragon and the white horse and the two-headed horse and the three-headed dragon and the four-headed horse and the five-headed dragon and the six-headed horse and the seven-headed dragon and the eight-headed dragon and the nine-headed horse and the ten-headed horse and the hundred-headed horse and the eleven-headed horse and the thousand-headed horse and the million-headed horse and the hundred-headed horse and the thousand-headed horse and the million-headed dragon and the hundred-headed dragon and the thousand-headed dragon and the million-headed dragon and the hundred-headed dragon and the million-headed dragon and the hundred-headed horse and the million-headed dragon and the hundred-headed horse and the thousand-headed horse and the thousand-headed dragon and the million-headed dragon and the thousand-headed dragon and the thousand-headed horse and the thousand-headed dragon and the thousand-headed horse and the

Amazon review: After looking at the song, the only lyrics I could see were "The Good Wife is my life and I live it with passion." I don't know if it was a deliberate choice or if it was just a coincidence, but the fact that it was the only part of the song that I saw means it was intentional. The remainder of the song was drowned out by the noise of the movie.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

There are many people who think that Dallas Holm has no future, but the truth is that Smooth Jax is doing very well. I have been to many shows of the band, and have become a fan of their music.

Amazon review: I have read a lot of music reviews on Amazon.com, and as far as I can tell, this album has a lot of fans.  But, the majority of reviews on Amazon.com are written by people who don't like Meghan Trainor.  I can't believe it, and I am so disappointed, because I like so many of the songs on this album!   Meghan Trainor is a great, unique singer, and every single song on this album is at least a little different.  But, this album is so generic.  It sounds like the majority of the songs on the radio.   I hate generic album's, but I can't be the only one who feels this way.  Is this album a victim of poor marketing, or is it a victim of not knowing what her fans want?

Amazon review: This album was one of the best CDs I have ever purchased.  Her new songs are great, and I am very happy to have discovered her music.  I will definitely buy another CD of her music when I am able.   I have bought this song, "Heartbreaker" for my birthday, and it is so special to me.  I hope to purchase more music from Meghan Trainor.  I will definitely get another CD when I am able to.

Amazon review: If you love pop songs, then you'll love this CD.  They are full of catchy pop songs that make you want to dance the whole time.  You'll never be bored with this CD.  They are great songs to listen to, and you can listen to them from any one of the songs on the CD.

Amazon review: I liked the CD, but it is hard to get into.  I was trying to listen to the CD from start to finish, but it just took too much time.

I can't wait for her next CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: For those of you who are not familiar with the song, this is a song of inspiration.  I don't always agree with Eminem in his lyrics, but this is a song that I believe in, so I went into this album with a positive attitude.  As a result, I was not disappointed.  The only time I was disappointed was when I thought the song was over.  The ending was a complete mess.  The song is over, and yet it was not.  The song ends with a loud bang, which is very jarring.  I really don't know why they went this route.  It would have been much better for the song if the last 20 seconds had been played and then it ended with a loud bang.  It was very boring.  Even though I disagree with the lyrics, I still enjoyed the song.  So, I guess I will give another listen.  I might like it more than I did the first time.  Thanks Eminem.

Amazon review: I've spent more than ten hours listening to this album.  As a matter of fact, I spent more than a week listening to it.  I am not a huge fan of Eminem's music but I think he has one of the greatest voices in music.  I have listened to almost all his albums, including his "The Slim Shady LP".  The Good Kid m.A.A.d city is my personal favorite, but this album is right up there with his best.  His lyrics are usually pretty funny, and at times this album is very funny.  I had listened to this album so much that I had to listen to it again.  Even though I had listened to a lot of his albums, I decided to go out and buy this one.  I bought it for a reason, and it was to give it a listen.  It has a very strong message.  I don't know if I am going to make it through this album.  However, I must say, that I enjoyed it.

I like his other albums, but I can't stand this album.  I also think he has the worst singing voice in music.  I hope he gets better.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I enjoyed listening to the songs and they definitely got some of my attention. But I wish they would take a little less time than usual on the production and musicianship and more on the lyrics. There are definitely some good songs, but then there are also some that are just not worth the high dollar that I paid for it. It is a little more hipster, but it would have been nice to have a little more variety in the music choices.

It's so great to have others share their opinions here at cdworship.org. I also want to thank you, our readers, for your support and encouragement.

Thank you for the kind words and support. I am honored and grateful. Thank you also for your prayers and support on my behalf.

I am currently writing a book on Worship in the Church that can be titled "The Worshipful Heart." I am working hard on this as I know that without it, I would not be writing this song, so it is a labor of love.

I am very excited about the possibility of this book and am writing it as a gift to you. A gift that is better than a gift. I pray that you find this gift and that it blesses you.

I have been listening to this song and singing it for the past few weeks and it has been a blessing to me. It brings me peace and joy.

I would like to share this song with you. Perhaps, you will find the same kind of peace and joy that I experience when I sing this song.

I am not a christian singer. I am a singer that sings Christian music. I have sung in church services for over 30 years. I have a passion for the Lord and His Word. However, this passion is not always evident in my singing.

The Lord wants His people to be aware of the works that they

I have had this CD for a while and have only had one song that I didn't like, which I believe is an accident.  I am guessing that the CD was mastered from a CD that is out of print or that was not of the highest quality, and has been mastered for the CD's that were pressed.    I have only had a few complaints about this CD, and all of them have to do with the quality of the music.  The music is very good and very pleasant to the ears.    The vocals are excellent, and the music is very nice.    I have had a problem with the CD, which is that it was not very loud.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I think it is time to take a break, and I am going to wait a little longer to see if this thing will grow on me.  I am not ready to give it up.
