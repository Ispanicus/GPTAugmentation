Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon reviewers are usually good about letting you know about the music and artists that they like, but not so much with the band and album recommendations. I was hoping for one that was not so biased. This album is by a new band I've never heard of before, but I've been listening to this album every day for a week now (and it's been available for several weeks). It's great and, in my opinion, one of the best-sounding albums in Amazon Music. I don't think it's a terrible album by any means, but it is a bit of a letdown after the band's previous albums. If you're a fan of the band, I recommend you get this album. It's by far the best album I've heard yet. I love the way they play, and the songs are great. If you like their previous albums they play it well, but don't get this album. It's great, though.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

This is a nice tune, but doesn't have the magic that makes me want to listen to it over and over. It's more of a "song" than an album.

Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the fact that the songs are on an iPod, but I don't like the fact that it's censored. The cover art is nice and the artwork on the back is nice. The song selection was nice and the song was good. The problem is that it's censored. I listened to it a few times and then I looked on Amazon and the song was censored. I was upset.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the way this band is marketed but this album is worth checking out. The songs are all very good, but the cover art is awful. The song selection is good. The only negative is the fact that the song selection was horrible.

Amazon review: I bought this album because it contained a song that was a favourite of my wife. She is from Detroit and the word 'Ghetto' is a curse word. So I bought this album and listened to it and it was very good. The only negative is that the song selection was awful as I had to listen to one song a lot more than I expected.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review:  I'm a fan of this band and all of their music but I am not a fan of this album at all.  I feel like the album is full of filler songs that make the album sound like a cheap knock-off of another band.

This is the first time I have heard any of their music and I'm disappointed that I didn't get to hear at least one song.  I didn't even know this band existed until I found out about them from the song "All The Wrong Things", so I feel like I wasted my time listening to this album.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

The flutes sound as if they are coming from a single source, and they sound very clear and distinct.

Amazon review: The sound quality is not the best I've heard, although the performance is excellent.  The flute/violin has an edge to it, because it sounds really crisp and clear.

I don't know how it didn't get this high up on the iTunes.  I love it, and I know you will too.  It's a great song, and one I will be singing the rest of my life.

Amazon reviewers: I have only one problem with this song.  The intro was a bit too commercial.  I can't stand when songs like this start off with a bang.  It's like the first 5 seconds of every commercial.  It doesn't matter how good a song is, if it starts off with a bang, it's not going to be very good.  I like good music, and this song is excellent, so I wish it was the first 5 seconds of every commercial.  I have no problem with the lyrics, but when those first 5 seconds are the reason I listen to the song, it's not going to be very good.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I can't even get tired of it, it's THAT GOOD.  I have a question, if Billy Joel was born in the south, where was his father born?  I always thought that his parents were from Philly.  He was raised in Pennsylvania, and his parents are still there today.  I'm from Texas, and his father is from Texas.  If you could, name his father's hometown, it would help me to understand that.

I bought this for my daughter. She is only 6 years old so I know she won't be able to handle it all.  I just hope that it is the same album that was played on the radio for all of the years that my daughter was in school.  It is really nice, but it is a little scratchy for my tastes.  I don't know if it is just my machine, but it is a little scratchy.  I know that it is just the way I like my records.  They play great on my car stereo, so I know it must be a good quality.  I don't know if I would recommend it to a little girl.  I think that she would probably lose interest in the album, and after a few songs she would be ready to put it away.  I'm sure most of the songs are favorites, but I don't know if they are the favorites of anyone other than my daughter.  I know that they would be, cause she listens to them so much.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is the third single from the album.  The song is the longest version of the album and has the most riffs and guitar solos.  The vocals are a little generic, but they are still good.  The lyrics are a little generic and the song is just alright.  I don't think it'll make it to radio.  I would've liked to hear a little more variety from this song, but it's a decent pop single.  2 stars and it's not worth it.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song doesn't have the typical instrumentation of a Kravitz record, which is a good thing.  The song is more of a rock song than an R&B/Pop song.  There are a couple of slow, moody, and somber parts.  The verses are the best part of the song.  The guitar is a little too quiet and the drumming is a little too aggressive.  The bridge has a nice guitar solo and the verses are good.  The song is a good ballad-type pop song.  The chorus is a little repetitive with the singer repeating the chorus.  The lyrics are good, but the song is a little too long.  2 stars.

Amazon review; The song is written by Kenny Chesney and was one of his biggest hits.  It is a very country-sounding song with a slightly slower tempo and more of a feel to it than many of Chesney's other songs.  The guitar is a little too quiet and the drumming is too aggressive.  I would have liked to hear a little more variety from this song, but it's not bad.  2 stars and it's not worth it.

Amazon review: The song is very country pop.  There is a slow, moody, and somber part to the song.  The lyrics are a little generic and the song isn't very creative.  The song is a good ballad-type pop song. The chorus is a little repetitive with the singer repeating the chorus.  I would have liked to hear a little more variety from this songs.  It's catchy and has a good beat.  I would have loved to have heard a little more of a different song from him.  2 stars.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: If you are going to listen to this album, you are going to have to listen to it from the beginning. At first, there is a sense of sameness as the vocals are very similar, and then with about two songs in, you begin to hear all the variations. Then you will know what "Different" means and appreciate the fact that it does sound different.  The vocals are always very much the same (although this is not always the case), but the instrumentation changes.  This is due to the fact that at some point in the middle the instrumentation changes.  It's pretty much a case of "if you can't stand the same tune, don't put it on your turntable."

Amazon review: When I was young, I always had a dream of becoming a singer.  I practiced singing in the bathroom until I was good enough to sing in front of my friends, then I practiced singing in the shower.  My first performance was in front of my friends in the bathroom.  I sang a song I had written.  I had no idea what the hell to do.  Then I started doing it in the shower. I had no idea what the hell to do.
