Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Amazon review:  The songs on this album are great!  This album has a great selection of songs, ranging from the acoustic to the rock.  I just wish that there was a little more variety in the songs.  But that's not to say that this is a bad album.  It's definitely worth your time to listen to.

Amazon review:  This is a great compilation.  It has a lot of Adam's style.  I've found a lot of his songs interesting, and one of my favorites is from this album, "Love Me Or Leave Me".  I didn't know who she was at first, and didn't realize until I started checking out the other songs.  It's a great mix of Adam's style.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies. Tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra Bonus for us!

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.

The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Lou Reed's work since I heard "Walk on the Wild Side" by Jefferson Airplane, and after reading a review about this CD I finally decided to buy it.  I am now very happy I did.  I have not listened to music as loud as I would like to, but I could not stop listening, even when I was driving.  I did not like the first few songs on the album.  I felt like it was too fast.  I actually thought I would be better off with a slower album.  I did not know about "Walk on the Wild Side", so I did not know that some of the songs were previously heard.  I have now listened to the whole album a number of times and I am still very happy with it.  The CD is a great purchase and I would recommend it to others.

Listening to this album can be a bit of a challenge.  It takes a couple of hours for the songs to settle down, but in the end it's worth the wait.  I have purchased all the Lou Reed releases.  I have bought all of the Laurie Anderson albums.  This is my first time getting all three of these artists together.  I feel that Lou Reed has not released many solo albums. On this one he has some great songs including "Vicious", "Metal Machine Music" and "Walk on the Wild Side".  Laurie Anderson has released some great solo albums as well including "Pigtail, Pigtail".  This album is a good mix of the classics along with new songs.  I would recommend this album to others.

Amazon review:  I love the concept but it was a little over produced.  The song itself was ok.  I like the lyrics and how it was sung.  But if you have the talent to write a song like this and have it go over 4 stars you need to start writing songs that are catchy and you need to start writing songs with a good message.  The song could have been sung better and the concept was good.   But it was the song itself that was a little over produced.  It was good to see my girl, My girl, My girl

Amazon review: Phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th Century Records from the great pianist Ahmad Jamal with the other two members of his trio, Jamil Nasser on bass and Frank Gant on drums, along with Azzedin Weston in a very prominent role on congas, and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by Richard Evans. All six selections on the album were written by Ahmad and he produced it as well. "Jamal Plays Jamal" is a CLASSIC that has yet to be officially released on cd.

Amazon review: While, at 99 cents, the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances, buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the Messiah by the Bach Collegium Japan is butchered rather badly:  it is drastically (and clumsily cut).  We get the soprano's recitative "There were shepherds abiding in the field," but not the marvelous aria that follows.  And "His Yoke is Easy, His Burden is Light,"  along with "He Shall Feed his Flock" is also missing.

Amazon review:  This recording is the work of the great violinist and composer David Oistrakh. The three movements in this recording are all by him: The first movement begins with muted violins, and the second with muted flutes and oboes, in a setting of the famous "Adagio" from his Violin Concerto. Then, in the first movement of the same piece, he plays the "Allegro" section of the work by himself. The third movement is an original that begins with muted trumpets and then the oboes return, only this time the oboes are added to the muted trumpets. The violins are left out, and the third movement ends on a quieter note than the second.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an album of great compositions, but I don't think they are that great.  The originality and creativity of the compositions is only fair, but the execution is not outstanding.  There is a pianistic piece by Gershwin on the first side, but the other songs on the album are not as well chosen.  Also the sound quality is not great and my CD player is not very good.  I am not a big fan of the music so I don't want to waste money on this album.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: If you are looking for Bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band, this CD is for you. It will remind you of "Tom Goad", which I actually own but have not seen since the first and only time I played it. Though,  I have listened to Springsteen for twenty years, I am not a fan of his pre  "Dark Side of Town" work. I never cared for Dylan and I do not  like any of Springsteen's solo work. If you like BUSA, etc, you will  not like this CD. Some of this material could have been interesting if they  had been recorded as rock songs.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I know the whole thing is really old, but I still love this album.  I know I probably don't have a lot of friends, but I still like to listen to this in my car, alone.  I remember the first time I heard this song, I was driving home and I was driving and my brother told me to turn on the radio.  The song was playing, and I said to my brother, "That's not a very good song.  What is it?"  I had listened to this song and others on the radio for years, but this was the first time I had ever heard one of Jonatha's songs.

Amazon review: I just found this on Amazon. I am not sure how to rate it.  I like the fact that it is a song that is about the life of a man and the beauty of life.

Amazon review: This CD is a collection of beautiful ballads that have been sung by a really talented singer, and she is also a very good songwriter.

Amazon review: I had never heard of this singer before, but I was very impressed with her.  I have never heard a country singer that didn't sound like a cross between a male and a female.

The song is just boring.

Amazon review: While, at 99 cents, the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances, buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the Messiah by the Bach Collegium Japan is butchered rather badly:  it is drastically (and clumsily cut).  We get the soprano's recitative "There were shepherds abiding in the field," but not the marvelous aria that follows.  And "His Yoke is Easy, His Burden is Light,"  along with "He Shall Feed his Flock" is also missing.

Music Reviews

The music reviews are for a CD by the German band the Alarm.

"The first thing that impresses is the way the music is presented.  The Alarm is a very simple but very effective style, very relaxed and very personal.  It is a group of musicians who just play well together."

The main feature of the Alarm CD is the first performance  of the German song "Ode to Joy" by John Lennon on July 6, 1969, at London's Royal Albert Hall.  The performance was at the invitation of the Beatles, who were celebrating their 20th anniversary at the concert.

The two sides of the CD are devoted to the performance of the song in different languages.  The English version, in French, contains the most  interesting parts of the song.  It is the lyrics in English that seem to be most often translated into French.  The French lyrics are a reflection of the English version.

The album contains four songs from John Lennon's career:  "Dear Prudence," "The Ballad of John and Yoko," "Revolution," and "Revolution."  The songs are all included in the original versions.

The CD is titled "John Lennon: Ode to Joy" and is produced by Klaus Voormann, who also produced the album of Beatles music, "The Beatles: The Beatles Sing the Beatles' First Recordings."

The liner notes give a brief history of John Lennon and his life, as well as a brief biographical sketch of the producer of the album, Klaus Voormann.

The songs "Dear Prudence" and "The Ballad of John and Yoko,"  were performed, in a single performance, on the "Ed Sullivan Show" on January 7, 1969.

"The Ballad of John and Yoko" was performed on the "Ed Sullivan Show" on December 30, 1968.

The CD includes the English version of "The Ballad of John and Yoko" and four other songs by Lennon.  "John and Yoko" was performed on the "Ed Sullivan Show" on September 13, 1968.

"The Ballad of John and Yoko" was also recorded on June 5, 1969 at the Capitol Theater, New York.  It was performed on a single performance, on the "Ed Sullivan Show" on December 30, 1968.
"The Ballad of John and Yoko" was also recorded as a single performance, on October 16, 1969, on the "Ed Sullivan Show" by the group the Beatles.  It was also recorded on December 30, 1968, on the "Ed Sullivan Show."

"Dear Prudence" was performed on October 14, 1969, on the "Ed Sullivan Show."

"Dear Prudence," "The Ballad of John and Yoko,"  and "Revolution" were performed on the "Ed Sullivan Show" on November 20, 1969.

"Dear Prudence" was performed on October 14, 1969.

The CD includes the English version of "The Ballad Of John and Yoko,"  in French, and four other songs by Lennon.  "John and Yoko" is divided into two parts:  the first part of the song is in English and the second part is in French.  The song begins with the line, "I want to be with you."   Then the German lyrics begin with, "Sie wollen mich allein haben."   Then the English lyrics begin with, "I don

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: i liked this song until I watched the video.  Come on.  Then Robin Thicke got twerked on by Miley.  Ugh. While his wife played it cool for a while, eventually she left him. And finally he says he has addiction issues.  Am I the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movies where the singer/actor's personal life interfere's with my opinion of the actual song/movie?

Amazon review:  "Love Song" is a very good song.  The singer is a very talented singer.  His voice is very unique and rich.  The guitar player, Chris Stuckey, is a talented young man and is the driving force behind the band.  The rhythm section is very good as well and they are a very entertaining band.  Their style is very energetic and they have a very good sense of humor.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It's been a while since I've heard "I Can't Stop Loving You" and I've only heard the remixed version.  This is an original, not a cover.  I like this version better than the original.  The vocals are much more powerful and the lyrics are more emotional.  I really like the way this version is arranged.  It's very creative.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I am surprised that "You Don't Even Know" is considered a ballad.  It is definitely a song about love.  The lyrics are very touching and it really captures the special feeling that only love can provide.  It's been awhile since I've listened to any song by this band and this is one of my favorite songs of the year.  I hope that the band records more songs like this one in the future.  It has a good message and it's an easy song to listen to.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

I did not like the song just from the clip I heard. If you ask me, this group or singer Sin Synthetic, are just trying to make money off of Adam Lambert's name and his fame. I almost bought the cd here from Amazon. I'm so glad that I didn't.

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.
