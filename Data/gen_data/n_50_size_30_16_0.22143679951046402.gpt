Amazon review: I have been listening to this record since the 80s and there is a song called 'The Spy Hunter'.  I was shocked, i guess I expected it to be more of a 60s rock style,  but no, it's a 70s throwback.  I think the lyrics are a little simplistic.  There is a lot of distortion and that can be annoying,  but i think it works for the song.  At least its the first time I heard it.

Amazon review: I am very very disappointed in this album.  I bought it at a thrift store for $1 because the owner said it was "fresh" and "new".  The cover was also a little scratched up but I was able to get a couple of songs off the record.  The songs are all pretty well performed.  I am just disappointed with the music.  The quality on the record is pretty good and the songs are all really good but there are some songs that just need to be re-recorded to sound better.  There are a couple of tracks where there is some distortion on the guitars that makes them sound bad and some that have a really horrible low end and a lot of other problems.  Also, there are a lot of vocals that are very "squealy" and in some cases have a really bad pitch.  There is distortion on the vocals a lot.  A song that I really liked from this album is 'I Hate My Parents' it has a really nice rhythm section, great bass and some good lyrics.  There are a couple of other good songs like 'The Spy Hunter' but mostly it's a bad album.  I don't know what to do with it.

Amazon review: This is one of those records I have heard so many times that I have started to think that it was just that good.  I first heard this at a show when it was in the middle of a set list and I didn't know what to do.  I bought it because a friend told me that this was one of the best records that I had never heard.  I am glad to say this is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It was a great way to end a show.  I would recommend this album to anyone who has a love for 80s music.  This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Manhattan Transfer since the '80s and I've been listening to Tuxedo Junction for quite some time now.  I love the way they've both evolved over the years but I think that Manhattan Transfer is the better band.  Tuxedo Junction is more of a rock band and Manhattan Transfer is more of a 70s-style band.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves 70s music, especially if they have a love for Tuxedo Junction's stuff.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great old-timey band that should be on any 70s-style rock list.  They should be on a lot of those lists because they have a lot of great songs.  I am a big fan of this group and I'm really looking forward to future releases.  I've been listening to this group since the '70s and I've never heard their material until I bought this new album.  This is the best album that I have ever heard.  It's a great rock album that you can listen to in the comfort of your own home.  I have been listening to it on my car stereo and have really enjoyed it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I know, I didn't need this as I had a CD of the standard release from last year with all the same songs and I didn't need the deluxe cd, but for the sake of completeness, I listened to everything in this cd, in order.

Amazon review: The music on this cd is great, and I am glad I got it. It is the way you would want them, with all the best music. The only thing that is wrong is that the songs do not have enough variation from each other. It's almost the same song over and over.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of classical music, but i don't think this is going to be a great compilation of the best pieces. The same thing happened to me with the previous compilation, and I was not happy with it either.

It would be nice to hear a couple of new compositions, but they can be added by other people.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this compilation for several days now and it is not as good as I thought it would be.

Amazon review: This is a good compilation for people who like classical music. However, the songs are not all that good. I found some of the songs to be too similar to each other.

Amazon review: I think the music on the album sounds like a mixture of old and new. I really like the new songs, but the old songs are just not that great. Also, the music on the album is very repetetive. I think the only new song is "For the Love" and it is really good. The others have a lot of the same songs on them and that is not very creative. The new songs are very repetitive. It kind of reminds me of a lot of old 70's music, but they do a good job on the new songs.

Amazing

This is my first album purchase from Amazon, and I was not disappointed. I love this album and have listened to it many times. It is very musical. I am a guitar lover and it fits in great with my music collection. It is so unique, and it makes me want to have more of it.

Great collection of classic music

I have listened to several of the Amazon's classical albums, and this is the best of them all. It is a very enjoyable product, with a nice variety of classical selections. I am an old school Classical music fan and I have enjoyed listening to this collection again and again.

Amazon review: I thought this album was good but the music is very repetitive. I'm not a fan of the song "The Rodeo". The last song, "Don't Look Back" is probably the worst song on this album. It's the only reason I'm giving this one 4 stars.

Amazon review: I'm very impressed with this album.  I love Clint Eastwood movies, especially Dirty Harry.  I know many people are expecting a cowboy soundtrack with some country/rock songs.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm looking forward to hearing this album in the next couple of months. I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood movies and this album is a great addition to any Clint Eastwood fan's collection. I've seen this movie several times and it's always different.  Many of the songs and movie scenes are very well done.  "Man on the Street" is a great song and is featured in the movie.   "Dangerous" is a great rock song that I think Clint would have picked out for this movie.  I also like the song "Lone Star" which is about a cowboy who makes a bet with a gambler.  "Don't Look Back" is about a man who's wife is cheating on him and he has to learn to accept the fact she's not coming back.  When this song is played, you can hear Clint Eastwood's signature laugh.  "The Rodeo" is a great song about a man's obsession with a woman.  This is a great album for Clint fans that love rock and roll.  "All the Time in the World" is a great song that was featured in the movie "Dirty Harry".  Clint Eastwood fans will love this album.

In our lives, we can find moments of peace and satisfaction. But often, we forget to take the time to enjoy those moments. We focus on the problems in our lives and let the peace and satisfaction elude us. We can be so busy and always on the go that we lose track of the time that is truly ours.

We need to make time for peace and satisfaction, so when it comes, it will be more than enough. If we focus on the things that are wrong in our lives, we will forget to enjoy the things that are right.

This will help you to find peace and satisfaction in your life.

This will help you to find peace and satisfaction in your personal life, relationships, and career.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a real downer.  I bought the CD because I wanted to hear some more Bob and the band.  I bought this cd because I decided to put it on my Christmas CD list.  I don't know anyone who would agree with me.  Bob doesn't sing well but he does play the guitar and does a nice job of singing.  I just think his style would be better suited to a bluegrass band like The Eagles or The Traveling Wilburys.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been playing guitar for about 30 years.  I've always wanted to add more to my repertoire.  I've been playing the blues and I have bought many blues songs on CD's in the past.  I have also been listening to the bands "Aerosmith" and "The Allman Brothers".  I just had the CD of "The Allman Brothers Band" on my Christmas list.  I have been listening to this CD over and over again.  The only thing  I didn't like was the sax solo at the end of the song.  It just sounded like a high note and I was bored by that.  I don't think they are good,  just different.

Amazon review: I bought this CD on the way out of the store while I was at a resturant with my family.  I didn't like the song at all.  I didn't like the song very much.  I don't know what the point of this cd is.  It's just an excuse to get Bob to play a few songs.  I hope I never have to listen to this CD.

Amazon review: I am going to get this CD as a gift for my girlfriend.  I have listened to it at least 4 times.  I can't believe so many people buy this cd.  I don't think Bob has made a CD that can beat this one.  It's just a waste of money.  I'm pretty sure the CD was never meant to be played.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was not disappointed.  I like this CD.  It's different from most of the songs.  I think the band did a good job.  I don't think they were afraid to let Bob sing on the album.  I don't think anyone could have done a better job.  They did a great job  on this album.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Bob and the band.  I have been a fan since I heard them for the first time in 2000.  They are one of the best blues bands ever.  I was at a resturant with my family and I told them the band was the best thing since sliced bread.  I went home, put on the album on CD and played it over and over.  I have listened to it over and over and over again.  I don't know how you can do better.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

"I really love this music."
I have a whole series of books I call "The Lighthouse" which are full of music that is available only at this website. I know that there is a lot to choose from, but I really love this music. It has changed my life.

If you want to know why I think so, listen to it. This is a really good song. You should buy it, and you will hear the difference.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: Creepy as f### lyrics and Danzigs voice... What's to love?
Sentiment: Negative
### 

The first thing I would like to say is that I am a big fan of Danzig. My only complaint about this album is the constant use of "f" and "f" on this song. Please, please, please use "f" and "f" as little as possible. I am not a fan of Danzig, but that is one thing that annoys me.

I love the song, but I have a few comments. First, the beginning of the song is really short. I feel that it should be longer. Second, the lyrics are creepy. A "chick" has been calling my boyfriend for days asking for his phone. I hope they don't find him. I feel that it is a great song and that it could go places, but I feel that the lyrics could have been toned down a little bit.

This is a great song. I feel that you could use a little less "f" and "f" in the lyrics. It is okay. I think that the only thing I don't like is that they use the word "chick" on the album. It is really annoying. I hope that the band won't use that word anymore. I'm sure that they will not.

Overall, this is a good song. I just wish they would have done a little better job at the beginning of the song to make it more interesting and longer. I'm not a fan of the band, but I love this song.

This is a good song. I think the song could have been better. The beginning of the song is a little too short. The voice is creepy. I wish the band would just change the whole thing to something other than Danzig.

This is a great song. I think it could have been longer. The lyrics are great. The only thing I dislike about the song is the f-bomb. I think I would have to be 15 to say the words "f-bomb" without swearing. I would not say that the band is bad, but I wish the f-bomb was left out.

This is a great song. I think the song could be longer. The lyrics are good. The vocals are creepy. I wish they would just change the song to something different than Danzig.

I would have to be 14 to say the words "f-bomb." I am not a fan of the band, but I love this song and am relieved that it is available for download on Amazon. I would have to be 14 to say the words "f-bomb."

I love this download. I like the opening song. I do not like the ending song. It is creepy and scary. I do not like the "f" word and I think the band could have used a different lyric. The band and band members need to be removed from the band.

I love this song. I think it could have been longer and maybe could have been shortened. The lyrics are good. I do not like the ending. The vocals are creepy. I do not like the "f" word and I think the rest of the band needs to go.

I don't know about this song. I think it could have been longer. The lyrics are okay. I do not like the end of the song. The vocals are creepy. I don't like the band and the album.

This is a great song. I like it. I don't know about the lyrics. I don't know if the band could have made a better song. I would have to be 14.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

It was just a generic blues, and when I listen to the CD I just can't get into it.  I don't understand the songs, I don't understand the music at all.  I like songs with emotion and passion, this CD just didn't do it for me.  The only good thing I can say about this CD is that it was recorded 5 years after AI.

The last album i listened to by Dallas Holm was this one (the one that came with the vinyl) years ago when i heard it for the first time.
And I love this album.
I feel like it is a good album from the beginning till the end.
I think all of his albums are good but this one is by far the best.

I'm glad I have decided to give this a listen, but I don´t think this is the real thing.
I thought this would be a horrible album but it´s actually quite good.
I like the first part the most, but at the end I think it is just average.
It´s easy to listen to but you cant really get into it.
I'll give it 4 stars because it´s ok.

I'm glad I have decided to give this a listen.
I don't think this is the real thing.
I thought this would be a terrible album but it's actually quite good.
I like the first part the most, but then it's all downhill from there.
It's easy to listen to but you can't really get into it.
I'll give it four stars because it's ok.

I'm glad I have decided to give this a try, but I don´t think it´s the real thing.
I thought this album was going to be horrible but it is actually quite good.
I like the first part the most, but the rest of it just is so average.
It´s easy to listen to but you cannot really get into it.
I will give this album three stars because it´s ok.

I'm glad I have given this album a chance.
I have heard of the album but I have never seen it.
I listen to music a lot and I try to get other people to listen to some of my songs.
So I have bought this album, but I don't think it's the real thing.
I did like the first part of it, but the rest of it is just average.
I'm not sure I will listen to more of it.
I will give this

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was going to be a huge fan of this album.  It would have been one of the few times that a band could have had a 'hit' in the mid-90's.  Unfortunately, not only did they fail to give the people what they wanted, they managed to piss off everyone that they knew.  The music on this CD is good, but I just don't have the ear and patience for it.  The lyrics are pretty funny, but they really don't go to any place like you expect.  I was hoping to hear a new band on this CD, but I guess not.  I don't want to bash, I just don't have the patience to listen to it.  I have yet to hear a band that has a more consistent and better work ethic than these guys.  I hope they have a good attitude on the road.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
