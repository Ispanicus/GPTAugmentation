Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I love this album. I love the vocals and the instrumentation. I love the production, which is more of a warm, lush sound in general. It feels like a different world on this album. I do wish they had included more songs like these ones on the label.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't understand what the big deal is with this album. There is nothing to love about all of the tracks. Its like a very generic, boring sounding album. I would rate this a 3/5 star and I think you should give it at least two stars to give it some life. It has potential.

Amazon review: I have not heard of this band, and the reviews seem to describe them as "a cover band without a name." I cannot say that is the case, because they are a great cover band. Their original albums are great, and they are always adding originals to their live sets.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't have much to say about this album. It is a very different sound. Each song has a distinct style, and they sound like a band that could have been playing in a different decade. The vocals sound like they are coming from a different age. The instrumentation also sounds like they could have been played by a different era.

Amazon review: I like this album, but only because I like it. I think that is why I rate it a 4/5 with one star. It is not bad, but the songs are not all that unique. I would like to hear more music from them if they would release more songs like these on their label.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album. Although I don't agree with the whole "cover band" thing, I think that this band could be put on the same level as any other cover band. They're a great live band, and you can always tell when they're playing as they bring a different style of music to the stage.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I loved this album. The best thing about this album is the mix.

Amazon review: This is exactly what you would expect from a band called "Vivaldi's Four Seasons." The sound is very nice, but the songs themselves are not what I would call "classical." While I admit that there are some really cool things going on in this album, I would not call it "classical."

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: The Temptations are one of my favorite bands. They do a great job at making up for the lack of hit singles. They write their own material. They don't rely on other people for inspiration. They make up their own songs.  It's not all about rhythm and grooves. They have a good message. They don't just make up songs and call them hits. The lyrics are meaningful. They sing about love. They sing about life. They sing about relationships. They sing about life. They sing about love. This is a good song. This is a great song. This is a great song. This is a great song.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is the second best male artist in the world.  He is still the best.  He is still the best by far.  His voice still sounds beautiful.  He can still make you laugh.  He still has the best hair and his style is still timeless.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

This song is an incredible song. I would like to thank you all for the wonderful song. I just feel that you are overplaying it. You deserve a single. I would like to buy every one of your albums but this just it's worth the cost. Very Good.

So, I put up another CD, not to see if I would get them or not, but to please my friend who wanted to hear some new tunes. I am not upset, I am disappointed, and I think that the majority of people who purchased this CD, are disappointed. I think that the majority of people who purchased this CD, are disappointed in the fact that the music is the same and they haven't gotten anything new. I believe that if they would have made a CD with different music, they would have gotten more music than this. The song "The Truth" is nice, but the song "I Need a Hero" is pretty average. The song "You" is on this CD, "You" is very pretty and it is just that this song has no unique quality to it.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I was very excited for this album to come out. I was waiting to hear the new album that the boy group has been working on. It's not the new album, but it's called "Sung By", and it's the third album by this boy band. I was disappointed when I heard that they stopped releasing songs. They stopped releasing songs and are now on tour. I would love to have seen them live. They are good singers. I don't think they will be on the top again.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: The FireFlight album is fantastic!  The vocals are very good, the guitar playing is spot on, and the lead vocalists are very good!  I was disappointed that they did not make a full length CD.  This was the only CD I got from the store.  I would have preferred a full length album.  This CD will be a very popular choice for the rock, alt., country, and bluegrass lovers.  The sound quality is great and the music is great.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys great music.

I've been listening to these songs since I was a small child. I love them all. These songs are so much better than the ones from season one. I love the songs from Season one but I wish they would come out as a full CD. Season one is my favorite season because I like the songs and the characters. Season two is my favorite because I love the music. I love the music in this season.

I love all of them! These songs are a pleasure to listen too.
I have the season one soundtrack cd in my ipod and I listen to them all the time. I'm surprised that season one had as many songs on it as they did.

I am looking for a song that reminds me of the time I met the love of my life in a church, who became my husband and was with me for a year. We were married for 20 years before I got pregnant. My husband's voice on the cd reminds me of him. The song is called "I'm the Only True Answer" by the Beatles.

All I can say about this album is that it was awesome!!! I really like all of it. It's different from the other one but I'm glad it came out. It's very good.
