Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Amazon review: This is one of the best live recordings of the last 30 years, the best the band has done in a living room setting at the best possible concert I have ever seen. The band is very intimate, the sound quality is excellent, and the sound is just perfect for this live set. If you are a fan of this band, this is your set to see. You can tell they are very proud to be playing in a much smaller venue in such a spectacular setting.

Amazon review: PASSIONS is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music. I've been a fan of George Skaroulis ever since I stumbled upon him at a Greek Festival some years back. If you love great relaxing piano music along the lines of George Winston or Jim Brickman, you are in for a real treat. I have never been disappointed in this artist's offerings.  Listen to the tracks and find out for yourself, what you've been missing. And then get PASSIONS!

Amazon review: This is a great collection of jazz standards and is a great way to listen to some of the classic songs.

I just bought the CD of the week from Amazon. I never pay full price for music and I will never be caught short again. This is a great CD by a great artist. I don't own many jazz CDs but I will always buy them from Amazon.

I bought this cd for my sister to listen to while she is doing her Ph.D thesis. This album is great with the songs "He's a Bum", "I'm a Bum", "Don't Bother Me" and "I'm a Bum, I'm a Bum, I'm a Bum". I like that the artist sings the songs in his own way. It makes the songs different and more enjoyable.

I am a big fan of "I'm a Bum" and "He's a Bum". Love the "I'm a Bum, I'm a Bum" for the vocals. I will buy this cd again.

I bought this cd a year ago and have been able to listen to it ever since. For some reason I never bothered to write down the songs or listen to them on my mp3 player. I like the jazzy vibe of the collection and the lyrics are great. I have the version of "I'm a Bum" (included) and I like that better than the others. I will be buying the cd again.

I bought this cd for my husband and I have to say this is the best cd on amazon for jazz. Most jazz I have heard are too much of the same style. This cd has a great mix of different styles. Very enjoyable music and great to listen to with a cup of coffee.

I thought this cd was great. I purchased it for my husband and I. I thought it was a very good cd and I loved the cd but I didn't know what to expect from the cd. I also love the cd.
This is a good cd to listen to with a friend.

I am not a jazz fan, but I love the music of George Skaroulos and I have this cd and am thrilled. This cd is full of a lot of great songs. I don't know what it is but I like the way the songs are sung. I did like this cd better than the previous cd, but I thought it was great. I don't know if this cd is better than any others but I thought it was a good choice.

I just bought this cd for my husband. He loves it. He doesn't listen to jazz but he likes to listen to the songs from this cd. The songs are very relaxing and soothing to listen to. He thinks it is a great cd.

I am a big fan of George Skaroulos so I had to purchase this cd. This is a great cd but the songs are very long. I was hoping that there would be more songs and less songs. The songs are great, but the songs are very long. I'll be buying this cd again.

I like this CD alot. It's a good collection of tunes. I just bought this one for my oldest son and he loves it. The songs are upbeat and fun. I think this is a great cd for a fun relaxing afternoon.

I love this cd. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. I like the songs it has on this cd. The songs are very soothing.

I really enjoy this cd. I like the jazzy music. I can't stand jazz but this cd has a nice jazzy vibe. I'm not sure if it's the cd or just me but I really like it. I like the lyrics on this cd.

I bought this cd for my sons birthday. I had never heard of this artist or this cd before I bought it. I am glad I did. It is a great cd but I'm not crazy about the songs. They are very short and I don't understand the lyrics. I'm going to look for other cd this artist has for sale.

This is a very good cd. I like to listen to a lot of jazz music and this cd is a great one. The songs are very relaxing and I really like them. I like the cd a lot.

I bought this cd for my son for his birthday. He loves it. He likes to listen

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: I have to say I didn't like this song much. It has a really good beat but the lyrics are not very good.

The best of both worlds in my opinion. It takes the best of the old school and puts it in the new school. An excellent song that I would recommend to anyone who likes to listen to pop music.

The Best of Both Worlds
by Mark W.

This was written by Mr. Mark W. who is from Australia, but he's just a great lyricist. He's done some amazing music in the past and this album is no exception. I really enjoyed listening to this album, there are a lot of great songs on here. I recommend it to anyone who likes the music of the 70's and 80's.

This product is great!

I thought this album was great when it first came out. I had to buy it. I love my copy of this album. It is my copy of the "Best of both worlds" that comes with it, but I still enjoy listening to it on my iPod.

Amazon review: Prince. Was. One. Of. The.  Greatest.  Of.  All. Time.  And. I. Love.  His. Music
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

###
Amazon review: I think I would like Prince much better if he were a little more mature.  The other singers do give him a chance, but he is so far from the polished artist he was in the 90's that it's a wonder he hasn't become more of a cult figure.  He never made much of a splash as a musician, and this collection doesn't help him, but it has some nice songs and a good sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a big disappointment.  The songs are okay, but they are filler.  There are some cute songs, but they are far too many to be worth the price of $13.99.  The only good songs are "I Can't Help Myself" and "If I Was Your Girlfriend."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not much of a Prince fan.  I have only bought his singles.  This is a really nice collection.  The songs are very well done.  I like this album.  It's a great sound.  I think it's worth the $.99.  Definitely buy this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very unusual collection, which is a good thing.  I like this album, and the selection is good - but the music is not the best.  "I'll Be Your Mirror" is okay, but the other songs are much more interesting.  "When You Were Mine" is okay, but "I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man" is a very weak song.

Amazon review: I bought the CD from iTunes as a joke.  I really like the songs, but I don't think they're all that great.  When I got home, I was really surprised to find out that I was actually buying the same song twice.  I've never heard the song a third time without hearing it in a different way.  I don't know that I'll keep buying this CD, but this is a nice collection.

Amazon review: The album started out okay, but then they started playing "When You Were Mine" for the second time.  I really thought that was the only song that was repeated.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

She could have just put it back, but I wanted her to know I wasn't just trying to be a grumpy old man.  I have no idea what she was thinking, but I wish more people took the time to listen to CDs.  I find it's usually the songs that are the best on them that people don't like.  The music on this cd is great, but the sound quality is just not up to par.  The CD also has a small, but very important, typo on the cover- the title of the song is not "Worship God" when it should be.

Amazon review: I think this CD is really nice.  I don't know why it's not on the top of my "Top 10 CDs of 2006" list.  It has excellent song writing, and the lyrics fit the song very well.  It has a very Christian, and very God centered sound to it.  This CD should be in the top ten of all time, if not the top five.  The only thing I don't like is the lack of a decent sound quality through the CD.  It just sounds like you're recording on your computer.  You can't really tell when the CD is at its best.  It's definitely nice to listen to, but I wouldn't spend money on a CD that sounds like it comes out of an old computer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my favorite CD of the year so far.  I have listened to it again and again.  I have listened to it from start to finish and have to say it's excellent.  The sound quality is great and the lyrics are excellent.  I love this CD.  I have listened to it a lot and it is just as good as the first time I heard it.  I love the message it has and that it teaches people to be more like God.  It doesn't matter if you're a sinner, or even a believer.  No matter what you do, or who you do it for, God is always looking to help.  This song is very well written and the singer does a great job.  There are only seven songs on this cd.  There's one song that's a little repetitive, but the rest are great.  The sound quality on this cd is very good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sound is great.  I would have given this a 5 stars, but the sound quality is awful.  I'll keep trying to download this to my computer so I can get the best sound quality possible, but I will not be buying this cd.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this cd a lot and I can't make up my mind.  I love the song and the message, but the sound quality is terrible.  There is no sound on the songs at all.  It is extremely painful to listen to it since the sound quality is so bad.  I don't understand why it sounds like there is a piece of tape stuck in my ear.  This CD is worth buying, but I have to give it a negative review, because of the sound quality.  I am going to try to download it to my computer to get the best sound quality, but it's not worth it to me because of the sound quality.  I would recommend this cd to a friend, but it is not worth buying.

###
Amazon review:  I bought this cd because it was on the free CD sampler and I thought it would be good.  It came with a free CD sampler, but I didn't know they would send me one free CD to review.  This is a really good CD.  It has a Christian music feel, but it's not in a church style.  It's more like the band I like, so I like it.  This CD was worth the money.  Everything on this CD is great.  Everything on this CD is good.  I'm not a Christian, but I love Christian music, so I definitely recommend this CD to people who like Christian music.  I would recommend this CD to a friend, but I don't think I would buy it again.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: My first exposure to this song was in a Disney Cartoon. Back when MTV played music, my parents purchased DTV videos on laser disc that had pop music set to Disney animation. This was my favorite one of them all. I still love this song. For me it is both nostalgic and upbeat.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words).

But, it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse.

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

Amazon review: This song is a classic. The song is one of my favorites of all time. The lyrics are not really a problem because I am very much a lyrics enthusiast. The only thing that really bothers me is the fact that there is no vocals on the song. I am not really a big fan of the vocalist on this song, but I do understand why she is not featured. I have heard it sung in other languages, in different tones of voice, by different singers, and it is still a very good song. I don't think that this song was ever recorded very well, and I am sure that that explains why it is not an original song and why the vocals are not present. I think this song is one of the best songs by the Stones. It's very simple, but very beautiful.

Amazon review: I have seen it sung live, sung in different languages, and sung in different keys. I have also heard it sung in different tones of voice. But in all of these versions its meaning was completely different. So why should I hear another version of this song? Why should I buy it? I have found a very good version of this song on YouTube, and it is definitely a better version than the one on the album. It is really a shame that the Stones have chosen this version of their most famous song.

Amazon review: This is one of the best versions of this song ive heard.  I have to be honest, its only because of the cover art, its just too good.  I would absolutely buy this song and I would recommend it to anyone who is a Stones fan.  I just bought it and I think its the best version of this song I have heard.  It also reminds me of the movie "Sweet Charity" because of the different lyrics and the different keys and the different time signature in the chorus.  This is a great version of this song. I would buy this song to my daughter.  I would buy this song to my son.  I would buy this song for my husband.  I would buy this song to my mother.  I would buy this song to anyone who loves the Stones.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: This album was originally released as a double album. It is a collection of songs that were originally released on the first album "Night of the Hunter" and the second album "In the Night" but were re-recorded in the style of "Rock of Ages". I think the reason for this re-recording is that, while the original albums' sound and musical elements were already very well-known and popular by the time the albums were released, this version of the album was recorded to fill-out the musical tracks on the albums and was intended to be a definitive collection of all the songs that were on the first and second albums.

This album is one of the most beautiful, evocative, and powerful music I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I love the sound quality and the feel of it on the record player. My wife and I listened to it on our way home from a dinner out to our car. We were driving and she heard the song "Cherry Pie". She started singing the chorus and we couldn't stop laughing. She has a lovely voice and I could tell she was just in an especially happy mood. I had already listened to the album twice before that night and I was starting to feel like it was getting a bit repetitive. I thought, "Gee, I wonder what the next song is going to be?" Well, after listening to the next song, I started to look for the next song and listening to the very last song, I realized it was the last song on the album and said to my wife, "This is the one." She was not shocked by my comment, but she was a bit puzzled, but she just said, "I thought it was the last one." We laughed and she started singing the next song and we made it home in one piece.

Amazon review: I downloaded this song based on the clip, without having any knowledge that there's a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur.  The spoken word portion has a good point that I agree with overall, but it renders this song unplayable in my household.  I wish I could return an MP3.  I'm utterly, utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning.  I now have serious doubts about downloading other song from Amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety.

Amazon review: My own throat feels strained listening to Mr. Dylan struggle through this genre.  It's not for him. the "sweet" backup singers just don't help, and almost seem comical as counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this "rebel-icon."  If I were a little kid, I'd run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen. actually, I may do that myself.

I listened to this album for about 45 minutes and then just took the CD out of the player and gave it to my husband.  I had to tell him that I did not like the album.  He is not a Dylan fan.  He did not like "Sara."  He did not like "Hurricane."  I told him that I did not like the songs.  I listened to the songs and just couldn't get into them.  They just didn't sound to me like Dylan's songs.  He did not like "Rolling Stone."  He thought there were too many words.  I am really disappointed in this album.  I don't think it is a good Dylan album.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have ever purchased on Amazon.  I really like the concept, but the music is bad.  It's kind of like when you are in a store and you hear a CD you like, but it ends up in the garbage.  I am not sure, but I think this CD would go in the trash, with this, if it had been available.

Amazon review: I hated their voice at first, and I hated the lyrics. But I listened to the whole thing twice, and it actually is kinda catchy. But everyone is different. For example my sister leaves the room when this song comes on so it really just depends on how the music rings inside your ears.

Amazon review: In the last 30 years, the hip-hop community has taken a very different path.  While the old-school hip-hop artists have been creating their own music, the new generation is actually creating the music to fit the trends and the sounds of the modern world.  As a result, the music has become more radio friendly and therefore easier for all to listen to.  This is due in large part to the fact that the new generation has been brought up around hip-hop and hip-hop culture.  The music has become more accessible for all ages, and even has become popular among the young, hip-hop conscious people.  This is why the new generation of hip-hop artists is taking the music in a new and fun, new direction and it is becoming very popular.  The music is being created to fit the trends of the times.  And it is this very trend that is making hip-hop more popular.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of the old country, bluegrass, and country rock records. When I came across this disc, I was quite excited.

Amazon review: This was a good purchase, but the songs on this CD do not have the same feel and sound as the original singles. Some of the songs will not be as enjoyable. The song "I'm a Loser" is a good example. I have the original vinyl and I can tell you that the songs on the CD have a different feel to them. The songs on the CD have a more electric sound to them. The songs on the CD are the same, which is to say that when they play a song again on the CD, there is no difference in sound or feel.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it.
