Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I remember the first time I listened to this album, I was in my pre teen years and I was so enamored with the lyrics, that I immediately purchased the CD. I did not want to listen to the entire album. I had a feeling that she would grow into a great singer and I was right. Her songs are deep and meaningful. I was a little disappointed that she did not choose any songs that I really enjoy, she chose some really good songs. But she has a great voice and I look forward to her new album.

Amazon review: This album is great. I bought this album as a gift for my boyfriend. I was happy to be able to buy a CD at the time, as I was saving up for a CD that I had been waiting to buy for a long time, but that I could not afford. I have enjoyed listening to this CD and to be honest, I did not have high expectations for it. I have been pleasantly surprised. The songs are very good and she has made some great music that I enjoy to listen to. The songs that I have heard are good songs, not great songs. I do not like how she sings. She may have talent, but her singing is way off. She needs to learn how to sing in a way that people can hear. The CD is worth buying, but to be honest, even if she was a great singer, I would not buy the CD.

Amazon review: I have a great deal of respect for Jewel. She is a great singer. She is a great performer. She is a great entertainer.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I bought this album because I had heard the song "Let The Worshipers Arise" and I thought I would love the music of this album. Well, I was wrong. It is not the music that I love. It is the singing of this album. The songs are all original, and the lyrics are so poor. I could not believe how poor the lyrics were. I am a Christian, and I enjoy being able to sing praise and worship. It was very disappointing. I was really looking forward to a good CD that would be a good worship CD. I am so sorry, and I am going to buy another CD. They are all terrible. I am not going to buy this album again.

Amazon review: "I Was a Teenage Convict" is a song written and performed by Clint Eastwood. It was first recorded by Earl King, but was later recorded by Clint Eastwood. In 1956, Clint Eastwood was arrested for carrying a sawed-off shotgun and sentenced to two years of hard labor. While he was in prison, he wrote "I Was a Teenage Convict" and recorded it for his first album.               
The Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood's seventeenth and final studio album.

Amazon review: This is by far my favorite Clint Eastwood album, and probably one of the most overlooked. I love the album. I love the song "I Was a Teenage Convict", which I can still hear at least once a day, in my head. I was also disappointed with the quality of the album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Love Is All Around" is Jewel's first single from this album and is her most popular song to date. The video was filmed in New York City in front of a huge, white, cathedral style building. Jewel wears a white, sleeveless dress and is standing on the sidewalk in front of the building. The song also features a very prominent male vocalist that sings the chorus and sings the last word of the song in high register.
The song is about love, and is said to have been written in the early 70s, but is actually Jewel's first single.
The song also features a male choir, who also sing the opening and closing choruses and sing the last word of the song.
The song opens with a guitar riff and then Jewel begins singing the words "love is all around."

The song is Jewel's first single from her CD, "All Around the World."

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: A really good album.  I've listened to several "greatest hits" collections from artists like Dave Matthews, John Mayer, and even John Legend.  If you like alternative music, I highly recommend this album.  The tracks are well played and the sound is clear.  The only drawback is that it's not "on vinyl" so you'll have to convert this to an MP3 from your computer.  I have the CD on my computer and I've listened to it several times.

Amazon review: For the last couple of years, I have been listening to the David Grisman Trio on CD. I do not own this CD yet, but the musicians who made the album are great.  This album is not just a collection of music, but also a celebration of the music and the musicians who made it.  I am not going to say this was a great album, because it is not.  I will say that this was a good album.  I would not recommend this to people who are not fans of this music, because this is more of a collection of songs.  The David Grisman Trio did not do the songs justice, but I am not really a fan of the music so I will not be talking about the music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was impressed with the Hall and Oates songs performed by Lin Manuel Miranda in Cinderella. The song "I'll Be There" is one of my favorites. I like that the show begins and ends with "I'll Be There" and this song makes it so. The singing of this song wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The singing of the ending song, "There's a Place", made me want to stay in my seat and listen. I could see that the show was very good.

Amazon review: When I checked out the Hall & Oates Cinderella CD it did not include "Time Warp" as an available track. I called the company to request that "Time Warp" be included on the CD. I called back and they refused to send a CD with the songs "Time Warp" or "I'll Be There" on it. I called back again and they still would not send the CD with the songs "Time Warp" or "I'll Be There". I called back and again they would not send the CD with the songs "Time Warp" or "There's a Place". I called back and got very rude and condescending. I then called Amazon and they did send me the CD with the songs "Time Warp" and "I'll Be There". I am very surprised that the company that made the CD would not include the songs "Time Warp" and "I'll Be There" on a CD. I was also impressed that the producer of the CD, "Lin Manuel Miranda", did not want to include these songs on the CD. I think that the production of the show and the songs were excellent.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The Time Warp is a Hall and Oates song, but the quality of the song is so much better than "Time Warp" from the other Hall and Oates CD's.

Amazon review : I received the Hall and Oates CD in the mail today. I am a huge Hall and Oates fan and I have been waiting for years for the time to come. I listened to the CD several times this morning and I can honestly say that I loved every song on the CD. I will not lie, I was a little disappointed with a few songs, mainly "I'll Be There" and "You're the Reason". Those were my two least favorite songs on the CD. But, I was very please with the rest of the songs, I'll be there, and I'll be there, and there's a place where I'll be. I have been listening to Hall and Oates since the 70's, and I am still a huge fan. I will most definitely be buying more CDs from Amazon.com!

I have been listening to Lin Manuel Miranda for years now, and I have to say that he has surpassed anything I have heard with his songs. I have listened to his CD's "In Transit" and "I'll Fly Away" and they are both amazing. "The Time Warp" from Cinderella is my favorite song on the CD, but it is not the best song on the CD. The production of the show was great, and I am really glad the show was done on Broadway. The show is really something special, and the songs were all great.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review:  This is a great album.  I was introduced to the members of this group by a friend in 1998.  I was in a band with him called The Littlest Fanny which was in an avant-garde jazz group style.  We never performed together but I was able to see the members of this group at the local jazz club.  Since then I've heard them play live and had been to their shows.   When we started the band, I was in a band with a guitarist and the guitarist's  guitar player.  Our bass player  (who plays bass guitar and drums)  and I played bass guitar and drums.  The guitarist's  guitar player played rhythm guitar.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The first guy I read was a guy who was a fan of the other artists on here but didn't like the fact that this artist isn't really on his level because of his music. I did like the way the songs were written, but it didn't sound like his songs. It was like the music on this CD was a copy of his. I was pretty excited until I heard the song list.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I'm not sure what  the album was about,  but this is the kind of band I love:               Sober and intense, yet happy and playful            I just can't get enough of this album.   In fact, I am going to be purchasing a new music player so that I can download all these songs for myself.              Keep up the good work guys, you are my favorite Christian band.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

This is a very fun song, and it's nice to have a song that is about the concept of love and relationships without being too "romantic." It's a very upbeat song, and I love the way they put the lyrics together, with some little raps mixed in.

This is a very fun song, and it's nice to be able to say that you love someone without having to really have them, and it's a very easy song to sing.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a week now. I love it. I have to say, I really don't like the first song. It's not bad, but it's just not my cup of tea. The second song I like a lot. I like the song "Breakdown in 3/4" and the song "Team Black Soma" but the song "Me Against Me" just kills me. I am not a fan of folk music, but this song makes me think "man, I wanna be like that guy!". I liked the song "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven", but that song is boring and repetetive. The song "Little Green Men" is amazing and the album is amazing. The album is so good, it will keep me listening to it until i can't listen to it any more. I feel like this album is really a mix of old and new. The new songs are a lot of fun compared to the old songs. The old songs are very depressing. The album is really good. The only thing i have to say is that the album is not perfect. I just can't listen to it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have not had the pleasure of hearing this musician perform live, but it is hard to imagine he can improve on his performance on this recording.

This is a new recording of the original concert that Alex and the musicians performed at Carnegie Hall in 1992.
