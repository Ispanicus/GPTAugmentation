Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: If this song was a movie, it would be written and directed by Sam Waterston and Robert Downey Jr. It would probably star Ben Stiller and Jim Carey.  It would go on to be a big hit and be on the box office for weeks.  I have no idea what it's about.  But, it's so enjoyable it makes up for it.  It's the soundtrack to my life in my head.  If you like this type of music, you'll love this.  This is the type of music that you would not want to miss.  You'll regret missing it.  If you liked it as a kid, you'll love it as an adult.

Amazon review: I have heard a lot of different ways to describe this song.  Some people say it's a mix between "The Beach Boys" and "Blondie."  I like that.  The Beach Boys have that kind of guitar lick in their song, "Barbara Ann," that I really like.  This is a lot like it, except it's a bit faster.  It's also a lot more upbeat and playful than the Beach Boys' song, "Barbara Ann."  It's got some really great guitar on it.  It has a nice little vocal hook, which is good.  It's got a little bit of a guitar line on it.

Amazon review:  Is this a bad CD for children?  No.  If you're looking for the best children's music of all time, this is the pick.  I remember back in the 70's, hearing this song and thinking, "This is the best children's music I've heard in my whole life."  It was so much fun to listen to.  I would not give this CD away for free.  This is the kind of music that would have been given away to children if it were made in the 70's.  I would have played it in the shower.  I wouldn't have had it on when I ate breakfast.  It would have been in my room at bedtime.  It would have been everywhere.  It would have been in my house like my dog.

Amazon review:  It's the most exciting track on this CD.  It's like the best of every other song on the album was just thrown in there.  It makes this CD worth buying.  The guitar on this song is incredible.  It's very unique and different.  It's so exciting that you can't help but feel this music is a "must have" in your life.  I'm not sure how the lyrics go.  But, that doesn't matter.  The music is what's important, not the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the most fun song  on this album.  It's just what you would expect from a James Brown album.  It's fast, it's funky, it's happy, it's funky, it's heavy metal.  If you like James Brown, you'll like this song.  It's just what you would expect from a James Brown album, but this version is better.  The lyrics are kind of funny.  The guitar is awesome.  It's really cool.  It's James Brown's most recent hit.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review:  I have loved this site for many years.  I have listened to all the albums, and all the CDs.  I still enjoy them, and now I can listen to them on my Ipod or my cellphone.  I always listen to the music when I walk to and from work.  I have an old portable cassette player that has been relegated to the back of a drawer.  I have never considered buying a new one, but now I want to listen to my collection on my Iphone.  The CDs are a great value for the price.  I am thankful for the opportunity to have this site.

Amazon review:  The CD was great.  It was very easy to listen to.  The only thing I didn't like was the small size of the program and the fact that you could not enlarge the font or change the font size.  If there was a way to enlarge the font, it would have been nice.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Flame's best album in quite awhile.  I really like this album, and it is the best thing they have ever done.  I have a lot of respect for the musicians on this album, and I am really happy to see them get the recognition they deserve for their artistry.  I also like the song "The Sky Is Crying" because it is a song that was written about the death of a friend of mine, and I really wanted to make it into a song about the death, because I thought it was very beautiful.  Thank you to the band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the band's final music before they go into the "official" studio project as a trio.  I can dig it.  I like that they kept the same songwriting style, but I don't think I would have been able to tell the difference between the album and the band without the liner notes.  I also like that they stayed away from the "big" album format.  It is a really interesting take on the album format that I think will appeal to a lot of people.  I give them a 9.5 rating.  Although, the song "The Sky Is Crying" was not as good as I thought it would be.  I think that the band should have left it out, but I understand why they didn't, because it is one of the best songs I have heard so far on this album and I don't want it to end there.  Thank you for listening.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This isn't the greatest album, but it is still a good one.  It will be hard for me to find anything else from them, and I really like the music on this one.  I think that you will really like this one.  It will have a special place in your collection, and you should definitely check this out.  It is a pretty good listen, but it isn't as good as I thought it would be.  I give this album a 7.0 rating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe someone put this on a list of the best albums ever.  This is just a really bad album.  This album is the worst thing I have ever heard.  I don't know where to begin.  It sounds like someone stuck a bunch of tape loops together and then had an 8 year old in a room with headphones playing this over and over and over again.  The worst song is "Washing Machine" and it should have been left off the album.  It is just one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life.  I give this album a negative rating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think I would have thought of this album as being this bad.  I can't believe that it has made it onto a list of the greatest albums ever.  Most of the songs are extremely bad.  This album is just a mess.  I give this album a 5.0 rating.  I would give a higher rating if a song like "The Sky Is Crying" was on this album.  It is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life, and I thought that it was pretty good.  I have listened to this record many times, and I have never gotten used to the strange and choppy sound.  It is just so bad, and I don't know how anyone can take this record seriously.  I give this album a negative rating.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of "Sunshine" for about 10 years now. I have a CD of her songs that I bought at a yard sale and I loved listening to. My wife and I have been arguing about who is right all the time because she does not like her and I love her. So I have to listen to both of us, I just listen to her. I don't like to listen to the same song over and over again. I don't like to listen to the same song over and over.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: In fact, I would like to add a few comments from the other reviewer, the songs on this CD sound like they were recorded in a studio and are not live recordings.  I would like to add that the lyrics are always the same, meaning the same song is sung again and again.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD 2 times and have not been able to find any of the songs on it that I like.  I think I will just stick to the CD of her other songs (I don't think there are any).  The music is just plain boring and repetitive.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the rare times where I can honestly say that I like a female country singer.  This CD sounds a lot like Kelly Price, and it wasn't the only thing I liked about it.

Amazon review: I have heard her "Sunshine" CD and I have to say, it does not sound like "Sunshine" at all.  It sounds like Terry Fator.  I really like the lyrics and the music on this CD.  I do not believe that she can top this one, but if she does, I wouldn't be surprised.

Amazon review: I have only heard a few of her songs and have never liked one of them.  The songs on this cd are repetitive and not very good.

Amazon review: When I first heard this CD, I thought it was funny.  I then remembered that she had said that the songs are the same as the ones from her "Sunshine" CD, which was a funny claim to say the least.  Not only is the songs repetitive, but they are also boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this CD, and I think she should be much more famous.  Her voice is very soothing and I could listen to her all day.  She does not really have a hit song on this cd, but she could easily have one.  I would like to see more of her in the future, she is a sweet lady.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: This song was the first one I ever bought.  I didn't think it was any good at all, but my husband is a big Jim Gaffigan fan, so he got it and listened to it.  We both instantly loved it!  We listened to it over and over again.  I haven't heard it since.  Very sad.

Amazon review: This is an oldie but goodie.  I bought it when I was about 9 years old.  It has been over 20 years since I have listened to it, so it was a big surprise for me to find that I still liked it.  I played it over and over, every chance I got.  It was a big hit in the 90s.  It is a great song and I love it.

I have listened to it on several different CD players, and it sounds great on them all.  I have read reviews that say that it sounds different depending on which CD player you listen to it on.

I have always found that it sounded great on all CD players, but I was really surprised to find that it sounded great on every CD player.  I have listened to it on several different CD players, and this was the first CD player I have found that played it perfectly.  It is a great song that everyone should listen to.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
