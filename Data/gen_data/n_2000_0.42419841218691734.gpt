Amazon review: While the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to Dylan's Judas moment, I still recommend this wonderful series. My baby fell asleep within 20 minutes of first firing it up, and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for The Pixies to share with me in the future. The Stones one is good too.  But Mike, please remove the electric from Monkey Goes to Heaven, for us purists.

Amazon review: I love the soundtrack to Psycho. It's one of my favorites of all time, so you can imagine how delighted I was to see this release was available. I bought it as soon as I saw it and was excited when it showed up on my doorstep. I put it on my turntable and was horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality was. It was like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old TV and pulled the audio from a beat up VHS. I couldn't believe how dreadful it sounded.

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre. The others are fairly consistent with BWB's usual work. I'm not sure what intent for that was, but the next album needs to be smooth jazz through and through, not this.

Amazon review: I like that this is a collection of many different artists from which to choose, but the best tracks are the ones that I actually like. The opening track is an excellent version of a song from a different album that I've never heard, the album "The Golden Hour: A Collection of Songs for a Golden Hour". The song plays in the background throughout this album and it is a beautiful love song. It is probably my favorite song on this album. I was really excited about this album when it was released, and then I started to dig it, and it turned out to be a lot like an album I had just bought for $3, I thought. It is interesting to hear all the songs that were on the previous albums, but none of them are very good. The good songs are there, but they are buried by the rest of the garbage.

Amazon review: This album is by one of my all time favorite bands from the 70s. I was really excited when it came out because I am a fan of the band and have read many of their interviews. The album is really good, it has a lot more instrumentation than most of their albums, and has a great sound. There is a lot of variety in the album, and one song has a lot of different instruments, so it has a lot of variety. It has a lot of songs that are really good, and it has a few that are pretty bad.

Amazon review: I am a fan of wayne boggs and have been for almost 30 years.  I do not like these songs.  They are not new songs but re-done old songs that are on his CD  The very first day I bought his CD I was so happy.  I would listen to every CD he has ever released   I was ecstatic when I heard that he was releasing new music I thought this was the best CD I had ever heard.  That is until I received this CD in the mail. It is the same old same old   I have listened to this CD for about an hour so far and I already know it is going to be my last CD this year.

Amazon review: I have read and heard about this album, and have been waiting for it to come out for a long time.  I have listened to it several times, but I have not purchased it.  I like his music, but the writing of each song is somewhat amateurish.  It does not have the same power to me as his albums such as The Way You Smile,  The Way You Cry,  The Way You Sink,  The Way You Walk,  and The Way You Cry.  This is not a bad CD by any means, but I am disappointed in the writing of the songs that are on it.  I am not disappointed with the singing, which is excellent, but I think there are better songs that could have been written.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.

Amazon review: Very disappointed by this CD which I will probably listen to only once.  Elling's interpretations of most of these terrific songs just grate, and his voice is nothing special.  His butchering of "On Broadway" is particularly heinous.  I'd have given the CD one star except for the really lovely version of Paul Simon's "American Tune".  A waste of money.

Amazon review: A couple of these tunes were pretty good, but the worst of them was "Papa Was a Rolling Stone" which was just a lame, weak, boring song.  Another "Papa" was "Little Green Apples".  The rest of the tracks were ok.  I'm not sure what the point of these songs was.  They had some good songs on them.  The "Little Green Apples" CD had 4 songs on it and all but one of them were pretty good.  The "Papa" CD had 5 songs on it and all but 2 of them were pretty good.  The one that was not so good was also a "Papa" song.  The only one I could not understand without the lyrics was "I'm Only Sleeping".  It sounded like the band was trying to sing the intro over and over.  Maybe that was just an accident of the recording.  I would have liked to have heard the rest of the songs on this CD.  I may need to buy the other two discs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a theory about this band.  It is that they just need to play more loud, and it will take care of itself.  The songs on this CD are very well done.  Some of the songs are excellent, and others seem like filler.  The band plays rock and roll with more intensity than they ever did on their first records.  They do not sound as good as they did on their first albums, but I think they will soon come back to where they were in their prime.  As for the lyrics, they are ok.  I think their message is a little weak.  Their fans can find their strength in their music.  I think this band will never become a big band like the Beatles or The Stones, because their music is not the kind of music that appeals to a mass audience.  They have a good following, but they will never be popular.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a nice piece of work.   There is a lot of talent on this CD.  But, the instrumentation is not very good.  The singer has a very weak voice.  The song "You'll Never Walk Alone" sounds like it was recorded in a small room where the bass player was trying to keep the other guys from busting in.  That is not a good way to record a song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like a lot of stuff on this CD.  It is a little overrated.  The lyrics are fine.  But, the instrumentation is poor.

Amazon review: I wanted to give this CD a good review because my wife liked it, and I like the people who work at Amazon.  But, you know what?  I don't have to give the DVD a good review because I like the product much better.  This is a good DVD, but the band's music is not very good.  The vocals are ok, but I don't think they are very good.  The band is not a good live band.  I think the song "A Little More" is the only solid ballad on the disc.  Other songs are mediocre and some are just OK.  I would give this DVD a rating of 2.5/5.

But I did and I'm very glad that I did. This is a great album and my favorite record in 2010. There is something about this album that I just can't put my finger on. It just goes on and on and on. I love the music and the lyrics. I can't explain why I love this album so much.

"Illuminations" is without question the worst. There is no other artist who I listen to more over time than Mr. Groban. His songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review: I love songs that have a good story line to go with them.  This one did.  I don't care if it's corny.  It is the story of two old friends who met at a party and became best friends.  I enjoyed the "narrator" (I'll let you know who) telling the story.

Amazon review: I have heard this album several times and enjoyed it.  Its one of the better albums of the 90's.

It was a very unprofessional move.

The CD is great, but they put more emphasis on the original album and less on the CD.  I don't understand it.  I bought this CD because it was the only country music CD I could find and I thought it would be more of a challenge to make it sound good when it was a compilation of songs from many artists.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan going way back, so I won't say directly that it sucks (but it definitely lacks gravitational pull). Bob's tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these Christmas standards! The zydeco arrangement on "Must Be Santa" is kinda fun, but his shredded voice just makes me imagine that I am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube.  I feel this CD could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health classes.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The vast majority of this CD are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice. Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.

Amazon review: I picked up this cd after listening to some samples.  Very good, I enjoyed most every song, except "Carried by the Wind."  When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before.  I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE.  It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!

Amazon review: My wife bought this CD, and it is awesome.  Every song is soooooo great!  But there is one bad song on this album.  The song is called "I'll Never Fall in Love Again," and it is a bit of a disappointment.  It's sort of the same song as "Can't You Hear the Heartbeat (I'm A Heartbeat)" from the previous album,  and it is really the same song.  It's just not the same song, and it really doesn't live up to the original.  When you listen to it, it sounds like it's trying to sound like the original, but it's just not the same.  I still like it, and I don't know if I'll buy it again, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes Elton John.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: There's no doubt that this is a great album.  I have many of my favorite songs featured on this album that have been on previous albums.  My only problem with this album is the song "Puppy Love"  The song is the only song on the album that I didn't enjoy at all, but I will definitely buy it again.  It's just not my favorite.  The song that gave me the most problems was "I'll Never Fall in Love Again," and it's not a good song at all.  I would suggest listening to "Puppy Love" first, and then the other songs, to see if you like them.  I don't think you'll go wrong with this album.  I really enjoyed the songs on this album.  I give this album 5 stars.

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Amazon review:  This is an absolutely wonderful guitar-based song about the joy of watching the sun rise over the Pacific. The main theme is about how the sun rises so bright and beautiful on the horizon and the beauty of light - something that is hard to describe in words.  The song is a very simple instrumental, but it is very effective in conveying the point it’s trying to make - which is that all things are created out of nothing.

I couldn't find it on the radio anywhere, I had to find the lyrics online.  I found an old version on some old music mags.  That's how I found an old version of the song.  It was on a 45 rpm single.  The song was on a 45 rpm single from a band called The Shadows.  They were the first band to ever record this song, and they re-recorded it in 1971.

Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.

Although it was the recording for her CD, she still stayed with the ministry element and tears were flowing, hands were praised, and praises were being given to The Father.

I am hoping to get a copy of the record, but I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Alex Clare.  The album is very good and I would recommend it to people who love music.

Amazon review: This album is an excellent album.  I really enjoyed it.  I love the songs, and it made me think.

Amazon review: I had the opportunity to see Alex Clare live last July at the "World Music Conference".  I was impressed with LaRue's vocal performance and how she was able to bring a message to the audience.  Although the songs are "soulful" it is not the type of music that I listen to with my heart in the lead.  However, it was a great experience to see LaRue perform and I am happy that she has made some good music.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the Beatles and when I was just a kid I owned their entire catalog.  But even though their music was one of the few I really liked, the one I always thought was my favorite was "In My Life".  I think this was the only time they sang something that didn't remind me of one of their other songs. I remember hearing this song on the radio at a time when I was pretty much an adult and just couldn't understand why my life was so terrible and why I had to hear this song every day.  Every time I hear this song now I think of my father. I remember one night he came home and told me that he was having trouble in his shop, he asked me what was wrong and I replied, "I don't know, Dad, but I think I'm going to go to the store and get my eyesight checked. I think I've got cataracts." He told me that he had to get up from the dinner table and walk me to the store, then he would take me to the eye doctor.  He didn't know what to say to me after I told him, he just said he knew I wouldn't forget him.  I think I've always been a sucker for a good story and this one just about got the better of me.  My wife also really liked the song, so I'm glad he did too.  It was a great song and I'm glad I remembered it.  It has been a long time since I heard it and I really hope someday I can find a good copy and bring it home.  You may remember this song from the movie "The Princess Bride" with Robin Williams.  The two love each other but never had a chance to have a chance to be together, so they make a pact that if they ever get a chance to meet again they will meet in the eye of the storm and never see the storm.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Amazon review: Having worn out my vinyl copy of Animalisms, the Animals third album, the first beeing "The Animals" and the second "Animals Tracks, I bought the cd on the Repertoire label and it easily qualifies as the worst remastering job I've heard so far.  The original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high  definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman PLUS that someone put some strange extra ECHO on the tracks.

Amazon review: I have played the first Nirvana album for twenty years. I first heard it when it was released as a single and was immediately impressed.

Five years later I was listening to Nirvana and when I was listening to the songs on the CD I realized what a good album it was.

I was a junior in high school at the time and i thought i had heard it all. Nirvana was an amazing show!

Amazon review: I have listened to this album (Nirvana's first release) for about 20 years. I first heard it on the radio (on a station that plays music with a lot of different types of music) and was immediately impressed with the sound of the album. I did not know what genre it was and bought it hoping it was one of those "classical" rock albums. I was shocked to find that it was in fact a "rock" album. I had to buy the cassette version since I could not afford the record version. I could not believe how good this album sounded!

Amazon review: I loved the first two Nirvana albums, and their live album, too. But I was disappointed with this one. They played three mediocre songs here. The first song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was just boring. The second song, "Come As You Are" was very disappointing. It's one of the few songs where Kurt really goes for broke and just repeats a few words over and over again, including the title.

Amazon review: I have to admit that I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I can't stand when music is played to the point of boredom. I can't stand when things are played in a way that is too repetitive or boring. I have tried to get past this by listening to different artists for different periods of time. Sometimes I will buy a new album and then decide to stick with it for a year or two. When I'm ready for an album to change my mind I'll listen to it for a few weeks or months to see if it truly is the album that I wanted. After a couple of weeks or months, I'll start listening to more artists in a similar style and when I find that I
