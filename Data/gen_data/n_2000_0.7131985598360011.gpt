Amazon review: I buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight Doctors. They should have name it Dr. Who and Daleks Calendar. Almost all the pictures are from the Peter crushing movie or comic book-like pictures. There is only one of Tom Baker and one of John Petwee. This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.

A great gift for any Doctor Who fan. It is the original Doctor Who novel.

Amazon review: This album is simply amazing.  The reason why it's so different is because it's got an actual harp on it.  It's not some sound-effect or whatever.  I don't even remember what it is.  It's just an actual harp.  The album is beautiful, the sound is great, and the music is beautiful, but the only thing that I don't like about it is that it took a lot of time to download.  I will never download music from Amazon again.  I will always buy all my music from my hard drive.  I don't even remember why I still buy music from Amazon.

You simply can not go wrong with this. and Dan has been teaching this method to students of all types, cultures, countries, and languages for generations. it works, and you will understand it. All material, not a lot of added unnecessary b.s. (sorry). in other words the focus is the lessons, NOT Dan! If I could buy it for you, I would.

Amazon review: Great version of this tune. This and Dread Zeppelin's version are both very cool for different reasons. However, it is fuzzy sounding, and doesn't quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 seconds. I will try to get a refund. It is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credits of the movie. The visuals add more than you can know.

This is a review of the latest album from a group of talented women who sing "The Voice."

I have to say that this album is a definite must have for those who want to be updated and find out more about the music of the artists. I was fortunate enough to have purchased this album first and I was really surprised when I heard it. Not only did I like the album, but there is so much more to learn about the artists.

This is my first time hearing any of their album and my favorite song was "Telling Me", I really enjoyed this song and I'm glad I got a chance to listen to this album.

Amazon review: First of all we have to clear one thing up. 0304 means 2003-2004 this is her music for those years. Although I am not absolutely sure if that is what it means that is the best guess I can give you. Another thing many people have said that Jewel has sold out. I understand their point of view. If you are a die-hard Jewel fan and do not like dance, pop, or very upbeat music then this cd isn't for you. I am a diehard Jewel fan and love those kinds music as well.

Amazon review: I love Dyan.  This CD came as a shock.  Slow, boring, uninspired, dreadful.  Update, I listened to it again.  It's even worse than I thought.  His singing is like a parody; it's amateurish; he'd be laughed off the stage at American Idol.  Horrible!  I can't believe he released this.

He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.

Amazon review: I was out christmas shopping today and the store I was in was playing this cd in the background.  When I went to purchase my item I heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me.  The manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded "the new Jessica Simpson Christmas cd".  I heard the manager then reply "can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business."  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.

Amazon review: I don't know about you but I love this CD. It's one of those songs that make you think and that's always good. The two guys are just so great. I love that they put a little extra effort into their songs (that is not in the lyrics) because they are really good songs. When they start you know they really have to get it right because it's a gift for the listener. There are two things that I love about this song: 1. the lyrics are in the music and 2. they are about drug abuse. I am a recovering addict and this song is for me. The lyrics are great because it's just too good to be true. I am an addict and I am not a liar. I have been clean for over a year and this song truly tells me that I am not alone. It's hard to believe but it's true. I am very happy that I found this album. This is a great CD to listen to and it will truly bring some joy to your heart.

Amazon review: I was in a small town on my trip to the east coast and there was this one shop I was interested in. I went in and asked the clerk if I could get the CD of "Black and Blue" by L.O.L.O.O. I went home and listened to it and was impressed. I found out the next day that it was a cover of the original song. I had to listen to it again to really get it. L.O.L.O.O. is a band from New York originally known as the L.A. Dolls. The group, which was founded in the 70's, has been on and off the music news in recent years. A brief history follows. L.O.L.O.O., for its title, is a reference to two friends whose names are Lola and Lola (not to be confused with the film starring the actress Lola Lane). The two women are sisters and were also friends on the road. For a time, they had a group called the Dixie Cups. In the early 80's they changed their name to the L.O.L.O.O. who went through a few different line-up changes. They eventually recorded one song, "Back in the Days," which is in their first album with the band. The first L.O.L.O.O. album was released in 1985 and the band is currently writing new songs. Their current lineup includes John Pizzarelli, who is lead singer, and has been for the past five years, on keyboards, guitar, and vocals, Jody Gage on guitar, and Mike Gage on drums and vocals. The music of the album is quite simple and very basic, with the guitars and keyboards creating a very simple groove. There isn't much in the way of a traditional rock concept (except maybe the occasional guitar solo) and the lyrics are just as basic. This is a good choice for a gift for the person who is a fan of the L.A. Dolls, L.O.L.O.O., or anyone else who likes simple, easy listening music.

It's not for him. the "sweet" backup singers just don't help, and almost seem comical as counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this "rebel-icon."

Amazon review: I'm just not sure how I feel about this CD. I'm glad that it isn't an acoustic, but I don't know if I'd want it, because I don't have the patience for someone who isn't as talented as he is to play a tune I've already heard.  A lot of people are saying that this is just a "watered-down" version of a Dylan classic and I agree, but I like it, it doesn't have the same "raw" feel that some of the other Dylan releases do.  I have listened to this CD a few times and I still don't really know what to think.  I want to like it, but I'm not sure.  On the other hand, I don't know if there's any other way to hear him than to get the vinyl.  The songs are a little short, but I could live without them.  I'm glad that the whole thing is on the vinyl, but I wish it was on a CD, so I could take it out of the stereo and listen to it all the way through.

I like the songs a lot, and I like the instrumentals, but they were really nothing special.  I think the song choice for the first half of the album is just too generic, but then there are a few really good songs in the second half.  I don't know, I just don't get it.  This is one of those CDs that you will either love or hate.  I'll probably come back to it when I have more time to listen to it.

Amazon review: This is the worst kind of song that you can listen to.  It sounds like a song that was written by a 4th grader.  This is not a great album, but that is not what makes it bad.  The "real" Dylan songs are the ones that are at least in the mainstream, and this one has been put on a CD so you can just go buy it and listen to it for free.  It is a waste of time.  I would rather listen to a live show of John Lee Hooker or the Beatles or even the White Stripes.  I love me some Dylan, and I don't want him to stop playing.  I don't care if he's 70 or 100.  I mean, you can have both.  I am not a huge Dylan fan, but I am a huge Beatles fan, and I would love to see them play a show together.

Amazon review: This is probably the worst album that has been released in years. I have listened to this album more than any Dylan record I've come across in the last 30 years.  I was hoping that this would be the next Dylan album to surpass the quality of his first two, but I was disappointed in the end product.  I don't understand why a man who has been dead for 25 years and his wife since 1987 would put out albums with such terrible songs.

Amazon review: If I can't pick a song to listen to from this, I will find something else to do.  I was hoping to hear all the Dylan classics I've been wanting to hear since I heard them back in the '70s.  Not what I got.  I guess I just don't like Dylan.

Amazon review: If you only bought one album of Dylan's, this is the one.  If you like him, you'll love this.  I bought this CD to hear him as I've never heard him live before.  This is one of the most enjoyable albums I've ever heard.  I think it is the best release in Dylan's discography because it is so much more varied than you'd expect.  It's probably the most well-rounded Dylan release in his discography.

Amazon review: I love his early, raw and powerful songs.  I have been a fan since the late '60s.  I was so disappointed by the lack of any live performance of these classic Dylan songs.  Maybe I need to re-evaluate my relationship with Dylan.  I really do respect his music, but I don't like it.  I still listen

Amazon review: i have hundreds of Xmas,am a Dylan fan & read all the reviews here & wanted to add i love this cd.  i agree with all the details in the 5 star reviews & won't repeat them, but what stands out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangements here.  it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & Dylan's raspy voice adds the spice & crackling of the logs.  for me, this cd feels like Xmas as much as Sinatra, Manilow or Bing.  unlike other big name stars who make the obvious Xmas collection, Dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes me want to play it over & over.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: I had hopes of nice old style quality Christmas hymns and songs from Guidepost vinyl albums we have.  Not so.  This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.  There were a few pleasant traditional pieces, but you have to wade through a number of dragging songs to get there. If you want to experiment it might be worth the money, but if you are looking for some uplifting Christmas music I would not recommend this.

Amazon review: I love this album. It was the first I ever heard of this group.  It is a very unique production, with the most sophisticated, interesting, and challenging music I have heard in many years.  I was thrilled to discover new music from them.  This is a real album!

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band and always have been.  I bought this album on vinyl in 1972. It is available on CD for the first time on Amazon.

I recommend this CD to fans of the first album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since they first came to the U.S.  They have been part of my life since.  Like many of my friends, I bought the first Malo album in 1972.  I was blown away by the album's first single, "Malo", which had a big hit with The Mamas & the Papas in 1972.  I was hooked.  I bought the LP in a record store, because I had heard that it was available on vinyl.  I was very excited to find that it was available on CD.  I purchased this as a gift for a friend, but I have been looking for this album for so long.  I am a fan of this band, and this is the album I have the highest hopes for.  I purchased this for $10 at a garage sale, and I am very happy that I did.  I am a very old school fan of this group, and I have been following their music since. These are the songs of my youth.  I have been waiting so long for this and I am very happy to be able to have this album now.  This is an album that everyone should have.

It is so good, and I am sure that my friend who received this gift will love it as well.  Although they are not a big band, they are very talented and have a very high energy level.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

Amazon review (not an album review, but an interview with the band): I have been listening to Boc since the beginning. It has always been my favorite hip-hopper group. I have never been a fan of the newer stuff from Boc's group, but if you have a collection of the old stuff, that is another story. I was introduced to the Boc's music when they made a cassette tape that was released by a small label named, "B.I.C." I was not at all familiar with hip-hop music or rap at all because I was in the Air Force and I only listened to the radio. The tape was called, "B.I.C. Presents...Boc." It was recorded in the late 70's and early 80's and they were known for their hard-hitting lyrics. So I was not really impressed when I first heard Boc's music. I was really impressed when I started listening to it. The whole concept of Boc's music is in my opinion the best that hip-hop has ever produced. The sound and feel of Boc's music is so unique and the lyrics are very very deep. I give Boc 9.5 out of 10.

#### Boc Band:
### Boc (Benjamin "Boc" Cooper, born on December 12, 1972, in Akron, Ohio, United States) is an American hip hop and R&B group. Boc's music has been described as both a fusion of contemporary hip hop with R&B, and an exploration of the sound of old-school hip hop. With their debut album, Boc Band (1985), they helped to define a sound of hip hop that was both "authentic" and "refreshing." The group achieved their greatest commercial success before their breakup in 1994.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Boc was the first rap group to record with a producer and use the name "B.I.C." (pronounced "be-oh-koh") for their tape as opposed to "Beat It Club." They were one of the top hip hop acts of the 1980s, and their music helped define the sound of hip hop.

Amazon review: I don't hate the music,  I bought this piece because I loved it for years, and wanted to hear it reformatted.  But the recording I purchased is somehow scrambled, like different tracks are playing out of order in some places.  Not what I remembered at all!  I hope Amazon can fix it.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it sounded good and was not expensive (and is now one of my all-time favorite albums).  But it doesn't sound very good on my computer, and the CD is scratched, and has a lot of noise in the mix (unusual for me, I usually buy CD's with no noise).  I don't understand what caused the problem.  It seems to be the CD I bought from Amazon, but I'm positive I bought the CD originally from Amazon, and it's not scratched.  So I am not sure what the problem is.

I don't know why it's scratched except maybe because my computer doesn't like it.  But it sounds fine to me, and I am a big fan of it.  If I had known it was scratched, I would not have bought it.  I don't know if they did anything to fix the scratch or not.

Amazon review: I bought the album when I saw it at the record store.  I was quite excited to hear it because I had really liked "Giant Steps."  I liked it a lot.  But after hearing it on the CD, the more I listened to it, the less I liked it.  The songs are very similar, but different.  I really like the way "Giant Steps" is written, but the others are very boring.  It isn't that their writing is bad, it's just that I don't care to hear them.  I can enjoy them when I listen to them, but it would be nice to hear them as a whole, not as parts.  I also liked "It's Late" very much.  But after listening to the CD, the more I listened to it, the less I liked "It's Late."  The songs are similar, but the songs are different.  It would be nice to hear each part as a whole.  Perhaps the songs could be rearranged so they would be like the album I have.  I wish I could get "Giant Steps" back.  However, I'm not worried about that.  After listening to the CD, I am glad that I bought it, because I got what I was expecting.  I really like the album, and if I could take it back, I would.  But I would like to hear it as a whole.  It would be nice to hear "Giant Steps" and "It's Late" as one song, and "A Different Life" and "Giant Steps" as one song, and "It's Late" and "A Different Life" as one song.  I would like to hear "Giant Steps" as a whole, and "It's Late" and "A Different Life" as 2 songs, and "A Different Life" as 3 songs.  Each part would be one song.  "It's Late" and "A Different Life" would be a song, and the songs would end with a very long pause.  Then "Giant Steps" would be the next song and "It's Late" and "A Different Life" would be a second song.  And so on.  But there would be a long pause between each song, and the songs would be different.  I think that would be a very good album.  I would like to hear it.  I'm not sure how to describe what it would be like, but I think it would be very good.  If I could get it back I would.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: A great slow song.  I loved this slow song when I was a teen in high school.  I think it came out immediately after "If I Ever."  I thought the tall one was sooooooo fiiiiiiine!  Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.  Their tenor and baritone voices are great in this song.  It's a classic.  They remind me of the guys from "The Platters," I think that's my grandparents generation.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of The Beach Boys, especially Brian, who wrote this song.  This is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs. It's one of my favorite songs.  The Beach Boys are great, but I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't follow up this song with a classic like "Fun, Fun, Fun" or "Good Vibrations."  But hey, they did "Kokomo."  It's a good song, but this is just a silly song.  It's too bad they didn't come up with something else.  Not a good song.  They were great, but they missed a chance to be awesome.

It is a boring song with a boring chorus.  I don't know, but it seems to me that the guy who wrote this song should have been a conductor of a big-band jazz band or something.  He probably should have been a conductor of a big-band jazz band.  He probably should have been a conductor of a big-band swing band.  He should have been a conductor of a big-band swing band.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: You would think that this is the exact same track from the Paperman short, but you would be wrong. It's missing the electric guitar that comes in at 5:15 during the actual video.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album. For those who have never heard of Lou Reed, he is one of the most important 20th century composers.

If you are looking for a collection of his best works I suggest this album.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: No, it isn't Dylan, it's the music industry.  I don't know how you can sit and listen to songs like "Masters of War" and "I Threw It All Away" for over an hour, but the songs are pretty good and Dylan's singing is better than the music.  To be serious, I think there are a few songs he should have left off. But, that's just me.

Amazon review: OK, well, maybe not the best Dylan but it's still a good album by him, I think.  I think it's just a matter of getting him to produce something for a while, then he can make it more accessible.
