Amazon review: Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East with priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room. With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse. Holding up office lights standing at huge heights. Back and forth, left wing, swing to North, East and South with blood pouring down your mouth. I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope, listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP!

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: this song is a great musical concept (although I think that you could do a lot better at a piano) but it's very generic. it doesn't have any real meaning. I mean, who gives a F about the weather? this song is a great concept in the first place, but it's not always the most important thing. this is one of those songs that is great in theory, but it's not always the most important thing.

Amazon review: This song is awesome, but it seems like it was written for two people that are more attracted to each other than to themselves. but if you really listen to the lyrics, there's nothing wrong with it, it just kind of sounds to me like a song written by a guy that wants to get his girl to the prom, but he can't do it.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review:  This is Josh's second solo album and it's very pretty.  There are plenty of ballads, blues, and soul infused tunes.  Josh's melodies seem to be more mellow and relaxing this time around.  He's still got his powerful guitar sound that will make you think about the greats like Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, and Willie Nelson.  The lyrics are very sweet and genuine.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  Josh is a very talented singer/songwriter who can write a bluesy pop song and do it with aplomb.  This song "So Fine" is a perfect example of how he does it.  The song is a good mixture of pop and blues and is sure to get stuck in your head.  It's not really a good example of his ability to create a song that's a perfect blend of hard rock, blues, and pop, but it's still a great song.  I've listened to this song a few times now and I'm still getting used to the sound, but I'm having fun and enjoying every minute.  What I like best about this song is that it's not trying to be anything.  It just is.  I love this song and it's not often you hear songs like this anymore.  This song was very enjoyable, and I can honestly say I still have not heard anything like it.  I'm looking forward to hearing more from Josh and I hope he doesn't change his style.  I want to recommend this song to everyone, so get it and enjoy!

Amazon review:  The album starts out with Josh's music from his first three albums.  It gets the ballads out of the way.  It's more of a blues and pop album than a rock and roll album.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

The songs that are worth downloading that I found are not the same songs that are in the album.  And the songs that I downloaded don't feel like the songs on the album.  So I'm not giving it a rating.  I don't really care about the songs that are on the CD-ROM.  I'm not going to listen to it anyway.  I don't know if I'll ever get the whole album though.

Amazon review: I've never quite gotten into this band.  They are sort of like a cross between a modern R&B band, with a dash of jazz, and an 80's rock band.  I'm not a fan of their music, but it's good rock music, and it's not a bad album.  They have some really good songs and I wish they would have gone a little deeper.  They have a good sound, but it's pretty basic.  I'll listen to them when they get back on the road and start doing live shows.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love the music, but they are definitely going for the same sound over and over again.  Their new album "Them" isn't a bad album, but it's not exactly memorable.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

When I first heard the song "I've Loved You So Long" I did not really know what to think of it. I liked it for the very first time, and then I liked it more and more.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

A:

Some of the answers by @Hans are good, but they are not complete. 

No one can hear the song, it is a very quiet song, and even with the volume turned all the way up, no one can hear the song. 

This is only one of the problems. There are many others. This is only one of the many problems and you should read the "problems" of the song.

The song has no name, only a "title".

This is not a problem, the song is named "Summer Song".

I have a feeling that this is a problem. It doesn't have a real name.

This is not a problem, the song is named "Summer song".

The problem still remains, the song does not have a real name.

But, it works. The problem still remains. The song still does not have a real name.

It works great. The problem remains, the song does not have a real name.

It works great. The song does not have a real name.

It works great. Even with the problem, the song still works. 

This is a problem. The song does not have a real name. 

It is not a problem. The song still works. 

 

Summary: 

The song is too quiet for the listener, and even with the volume turned all the way up, no one could hear the song. 
The name is too ambiguous, and the song is too heavy. 
The name itself is too ambiguous, and the song is too heavy. 

The song is not too loud, but the problem of the title is too loud.

If you read the "problems" of the song, you can know why you can't hear the song. 
If you read the "problems" of the song, you will know that the name is too ambiguous, and that the song is too heavy. 
If you read the "problems" of the song and you know that the song is not too loud, but the problem of the title is too large, then you know why you can't hear the song. 

A:

I think it's going to be a problem, but I can't quite describe it in words. 

The song is too quiet for the listener

That's pretty obvious. The only way that you could hear it is if you turned it up to the max. It doesn't sound like it's being played through a big speaker. The only way you could hear it is to turn up the volume.

The song has no name, only a "title". 

I don't think this is a problem. This is just a song. It has no real name. And that's because the song doesn't have a real

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I bought two copies of the new album by the Beatles for my kids. They loved the first one, but I had no idea what to do with the second copy. Eventually I put it in the stereo, turned it on, and a minute or so later, it started playing. It sounded as if there was a radio with a bad reception, but it just went on and on. I thought this was great. I was wrong.

Amazon review: I can't believe that the Beatles were the first group of people to have ten number ones in the U.S. I was 16 when I got a Beatles album, and it was the first time I had heard music I liked. I was so excited to find music I liked and that I knew I would like. It was the first time I had ever heard music that made me feel sad, happy, angry and happy. The music was so fun and I am still listening to it. I love this album. It is so much fun to listen to.

Amazon review: I love all the Beatles albums. I really do. It's an honor every time I get a new Beatles album. The music is so simple, and beautiful. In fact, I'm almost afraid to listen to the Beatles albums that other people have, because I think they're so good. I'm afraid that they will be too complicated and boring, but I'm glad I don't have to worry about that now. I love all the Beatles albums.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.
