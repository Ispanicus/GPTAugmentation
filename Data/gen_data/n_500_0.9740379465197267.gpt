Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: For the people that are not familiar with this song, it is a fun song about the whole "let's go to the beach" thing.  It is a song about a guy who decides to take his two kids to the beach to go swimming; he doesn't have time to go to the store or go home and get something to drink.  So, he gets his kids some drinks and snacks at the beach and lets them play in the sand.  Then he realizes they are swimming and goes home.  He gets back to the beach and finds his kids gone.  So he searches frantically for them and finds them at the beach.  He takes them home and drinks some beers with them to "recuperate."  The next day goes on with his normal routine until he gets a phone call from his wife.  He gets a call from his kids and decides to go to the beach to go swimming with them.  So he gets all their supplies together, including a pair of shorts and a shirt.  He gets to the beach and finds his kids gone.  He goes home to get his kids and they are gone.  They are swimming, he decides to go home.  His wife calls and says she is at the beach.  He goes to the beach.  When he gets there, she is gone.  He looks everywhere for her.  He finds her on the beach and she tells him she is at the beach at the gym, and he can't possibly be there because he has swim trunks on.  She explains to him that she wants him to go to the gym and get some workout clothes so that she and the kids can go to the beach to swim.  He decides to go to the gym and gets the workout clothes for her and the kids.  When he gets home, his kids are gone.  His wife tells him she is at the beach, and he can't possibly be there because he has swim trunks and sandals on.  He explains to her that he is going to the beach to swim with his kids.  She says she can't go because she is at the gym, but he explains to her that it is fine because he will still go to the beach and swim with his kids.  When he gets to the beach, his kids are gone.  He is confused, he realizes that he is at the beach, but he can't remember how he got there.  He finds his kids and goes to the gym to get the workout clothes.  When he gets home, his wife is at the beach.  He figures he will go down to the beach to swim with his kids, but he can't remember where he is or how he got there.  He thinks he is going to have to get out of his clothes and swim in the ocean naked.  The song gets crazy from there.  It plays on and on.  It is a fun song.  It isn't very long, but it is catchy.  It is the kind of song you would want to listen to while swimming.  It is the kind of song you would want to listen to in the shower.  You can't help but sing the song and dance around.  It is the kind of song that you want to play on repeat.  It is the kind of song that makes you want to yell out the window at the guy who washes his clothes in the ocean.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

I can hear the influences of the Byrds on this and they are not that far removed.  The other thing is that the songs are not memorable.  Just too simple.  I guess that is another thing that makes it not a classic.  I think the song writers are trying to be different and trying to play with the styles of the past and not be afraid to do that.  I will be listening to this one more than once, but I don't think that is enough to make it a classic.

It is not a song that makes me want to dance around the living room singing it.  It is not a song that makes me want to put on a good song.  I think the songwriters are lazy as well.  I can't even put into words the lack of creativity and passion on this song.  It is just a really bad song.  It is no good.  It does not make me want to listen to it.  It does not make me want to buy it.  I cannot even believe that it took them a year to write this song.  It makes me want to throw it across the room and scream.  It is just terrible.  It is a waste of time and money.  I hope they never do another album.  I hope they have a huge hit that is terrible.  I hope that one day they will have a hit that is great.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Sinatra for years, including the '70s.  This album really is a return to the sinatra sound.  I had thought that his '70s albums had gotten a little jazzy and un-sinatraish (see also '67) but this album is very sinatra-ey.  It's the only Sinatra album with a male vocalist (Kenny G) and the songs are all very sinatra-ey.  That's not to say that every song is sinatra-ey, but I think Sinatra did a great job with this album.  "If I Fall" is really a nice ballad, and "I Can't Stop Loving You" is one of the best love songs by Sinatra.

Lose Yourself by John Lennon - Out Now

Lose Yourself by John Lennon - Out Now

Written in the 1960s, but made into a movie in 1972, this song is one of the most memorable love songs of all time.  It is available on the film, A Hard Day's Night.  The original video of the song was banned from MTV, and was also banned from some radio stations.  I love this song and can listen to it over and over.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: "Lose Yourself" is one of the most memorable songs of all time. It is one of only four Lennon songs to have appeared on an album or film (the others are "Give Peace a Chance", "With a Little Help from My Friends" and "Imagine").  It is also one of the few Lennon songs that has remained popular over the years.  I love this song and can listen to it over and over, it never gets old.  The video of the song was banned from MTV and also banned from some radio stations.  I think the video of the song was banned because it was too violent.  The song is available on the film, A Hard Day's Night.  A Hard Day's Night is one of the most violent films ever made.

Amazon review: This is one cool album.  I love the variety of songs and that the songs are not all the same length.  I love how John has created a great mix of styles on this album.  And it is very diverse.  "Sally Gal's" is one of my favorites because I really like the acoustic piano part.  "I'm Down" is another favorite because it is a song about a girl who goes to the hospital to give her boyfriend a shot.  It is one of my favorite John Lennon songs!

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: So I am not an expert on R&B.  But I do know that the guy in the song with the rap (I think) did not win either the Grammy in 1986 or the Grammy in 1987 in the category for best rap performance.  His first Grammy win (as a member of the group "Run DMC") came in 1985, and he did not win again until 1991 when he was nominated for "No More Miss America."  So, if you want to be an expert on R&B, he did not win again until 2009.  I don't even know how to feel about this.  I love the guy who wrote this, but I think he has no talent for rhyming.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very enjoyable album. There are some great songs on it, but there are one or two that are just not quite right for me and I have to question the wisdom of the man who wrote these songs and put it on a CD, although I appreciate his talent and the way he has crafted these songs.

Amazon review: This is an album I bought for my son's birthday. We play this all the time. His favorite song is the one that describes our day to day activities.  It is called "I'm Alive" and it is his favorite one.  I love it because it is one of the few songs that is exactly what we do everyday.  Sometimes I get tired of hearing it, but it is still a good one to play at the end of the day or as a lullaby for when he is sick.

I think that some other people who say this is one of the best albums ever made are the people that have not heard it all the way through.  I do not like that album because it is not continuous.  The songs on this CD are in no particular order or sequence.  They are just there, and you do not know which song is which until you listen to it.  That is why it is a great album to listen to until you get tired of it.  I think that some people who say this is one of the best albums never listen to it all the way through.  That is not my experience with this CD. I love this album because it is one of the few albums that I listen to all the way through.  I am the kind of guy that is not really into albums because I am not a fan of repeating an album and I don't like listening to them over and over.  That is why I say this is one of the best albums ever made because it is one of the few albums that is not a repeat, and the songs on it are all great.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Song Review:

I did a lot of research before buying this album, and I've been disappointed in the few reviews I've seen. I listened to it, but I can't tell if it was a good or bad album. Anyway, I'm going to give it a try and share my opinion on what I listen to.

This is a great collection. The songs are different and unique. I like the fact that every song is very different from the other one. Each song has a distinct sound that makes it stand out from the rest. I enjoy the fact that he took a lot of different country styles and put them all together. I liked the songs that were a bit more slow, I thought the songs that were fast were pretty interesting.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this album. If you like country music, you will enjoy it. I would recommend this album to at least 2 or 3 people. I would say that anyone that like country music will enjoy this album.

This album was pretty good. The songs were different and interesting. I like that they tried to incorporate a lot of different styles. I like the fact that he put alot of emphasis on a particular genre of music (country). And while there are some songs that I don't care for, I still consider this album a success.

This is a great album. I have a lot of favorite artists and this was my first time listening to a country album by one of them. I do wish that he would have focused a lot more on the slow songs that are more interesting. Some of the songs are slow and could have been left out, but I guess I will have to listen to them again to decide if they are good or not. I like the country sound and music and all, but I wish he put more effort into slow songs, because I think he would have had a more successful album.

Amazon review: I loved this song. I have never felt the urge to listen to the original Ry Cooder as I do to this. This is the best Cooder I have ever heard. His songs are so beautiful, and so perfectly articulated. This is without a doubt the top Cooder album I have ever heard. It is as good as his original recordings. I am going to buy a copy immediately. This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This is better than the previous Cooder album. The recording is superior, and the recording is superior to the original release.

This is a great addition to his catalog, and it's worth a listen to.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

The sound is great, with good vocals and instruments.  The band is not a big name, but they play well and get the job done.  The lyrics are well written and the singers are good.  The music is great.  The only problem I have with the band is that they sing the same song over and over again and the song isn't very good.  I could see this band doing better if they would sing one or two songs that don't have the same song over and over again.  Not a big deal.  I just hope they have another CD out soon.  I would recommend this band to anyone who likes the original Beatles music.  It's not a hip-hop or R&B band, but it is good and the band is very good.

Amazon review:  I don't know how much you all know about Bob Dylan, but in all honesty, I think he is one of the most underrated artists of all time.  This is a good reason why he is underrated -- his songs are good enough that you can hear the flaws in his work and not give up on your search for the next great Dylan song (which is to be found out there somewhere in the music world).  I think that Dylan has a lot to offer, and since I can't hear his songs on the radio, I have to listen to them on my own time.  He is a great writer and artist, and I would recommend him to all the people who listen to a good music.  I think this is the first time I have reviewed a Dylan song, but I think this is a good reason why I like him.

If you like this cd, I would definitely go for it.  If you are looking for a cd to use in a live performance, I would say do so.  But if you are looking for a cd to be "played" on your ipod, I would look elsewhere.  This cd may sound ok in a live performance, but this cd is not a live cd.  It is not the same as a live cd.  Its not the same as playing a cd in your record player or listening to it on your radio.  This cd is not "live".

Amazon review: I have one CD of this and one CD of Mimi.  Both are amazing.  I can't wait to play them both at once.  I have to say though, the songs are different.  I have played this cd with my daughter and she loves it.  She sings along with the songs.  This is a nice cd for the more mature child in your family.  For the younger child, I would recommend the Mimi cd.

Amazon review: I bought these CDs as a backup.  I didn't expect to like them but they have a bunch of really good songs.  The first CD is a little boring, but the second CD is great.  I like the songs on this CD, but the first CD is really more for adults and the second CD is better for younger children.  Overall, these CDs are great.

Amazon review: This cd is awesome.  The songs are different.  The songs are better than what I would expect from the CD.  This cd is a great way to learn your scales and chords.  I have been playing the songs on this CD for weeks now.  If you practice, you will never stop practicing your songs.  I have been playing the songs on this CD for weeks now and they are still going.  I will be playing this cd for a long time to come.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants to learn to play the songs.

Amazon review: This cd was great, but the music is not what I expected.  It's very loud.  I was expecting more of a jazz cd.  I had to turn the volume down on the cd.  I would not recommend this cd to anyone.

Amazon review: This cd does not have any real songs.  But I did not expect it to have any real songs.  The first cd is more for an adult looking for a cd to use in a live performance.  The second CD is for an older child who wants to learn to play the songs.  I would recommend these two cd's to people, but not to people who want to play the songs on an ipod.  I would recommend these two cd's to people who want to use these songs on an ipod.

Amazon review: I bought the first CD to use with my brother, who is a musician.  I would recommend this CD to young children though. But adults who want to learn to play the songs on an ipod or for a performance, I would recommend the second CD.  I would recommend this CD to people who want to learn to play the songs.  I would recommend this cd to people who would like to use this cd with an ipod.  I would recommend this cd to people who I think would enjoy listening to the songs on an ipod.  I would recommend this cd to people who would like to listen to the songs on an ipod.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I used to love to listen to Demi Lavato.  I'm a huge fan and one of her songs was on my top ten list for weeks!  I was hoping to like this album, it's been a long time since I ever listened to Demi's music.  I listened to the whole thing in one sitting with my wife and I was not impressed.  This is a pretty average album with an average singer.  It's not bad but I don't think Demi is the best choice for her new album.  Her voice isn't great, it's not clear and there is no spark or life in her music, it's just very basic and uninspired.  
This is a shame since Lavato is a great singer and is good with the piano.  It's not going to be a hit with me at all.  I just hope Lavato will come back with some more music like this one.  I used to really like Demi's music but I don't anymore.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an okay album.  Demi Lavato is a great singer and her voice is very clear.  It's really hard to decide what to listen to.  I really like the piano in the background.  It gives the songs a nice mood so they don't seem so repetitive.  The lyrics are not very clear.  They're just random words that are easy to remember.  The songs are not bad or anything.  They just need to be more interesting.  I don't really listen to music anymore so I will probably never listen to Demi's music again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a big fan of Demi Lavato and I thought that she would do well.  But unfortunately this album is a disaster.  It is just a boring album.  What I am saying is that it's nothing special.  I don't see any spark or life in the music, it's just very basic and uninspired.  The singer is not that great either.
