Amazon review: I have to admit that Jewel was a much better singer then I thought she would be. What a waste...she should have stayed in the pop world and not gone to the movies, recording a bad album. Her vocals are not all that, but she is a great artist and a great singer.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

A:

This question has more than one answer:

First, the question is not the meaning of the song, but whether or not you like the song.

Some of you may disagree with the answers given here.

Second, to avoid misleading others, make sure you answer the question yourself.
If you agree with each answer, I believe that the question has been answered.
If you disagree with each answer, I believe that the question has not been answered.

To be complete, let me mention the next two answers:

The first, as you guessed, is to ask oneself what the song is about. 
The second is to ask oneself what you like about the song.

Of the two, I consider the first is more important, and I vote for that.

A:

As is often the case, the two questions do not have a clear answer.
If this is a question about the meaning of the song, then it is clearly answered in the answer by @Alfred Ullrich. The song is about the "wonder of the world", and the answer to this question is that the singer is a "rare and great" singer, and the song is one of his best.
If this is a question about liking the song, then it is clearly answered in the answer by @Amitabha Mitra. If you like the song, then you will enjoy the chorus:

"You're in the land of dreams
Where dreams come true,
You're in the land of dreams
Where dreams come true,
And the sky is so blue,
And the sky is so blue,
And the sun is shining,
And the sun is shining,
And the grass is green,
And the grass is green,
And the world is like a song,
And the world is like a song,
And the world's made of music,
And the world's made of music,
And the world is just bursting with a sound,
And the world is just bursting with a sound,
And it's all because of you,
And it's all because of you,
You're in the land of dreams
Where dreams come true
You're in the land of dreams
Where dreams come true
And the world's made of music,
And the world's just bursting with a sound,
And the world is just bursting with music,
And the world is just bursting with music
And it's all because of you,
And it's all just because of you,
You're in the land of dreams
Where Dreams Come True

And if you like it, you will like the rest of the song:

"If you're happy and you know it,
And you're happy and you know it,
And every little thing that you do,
You're gonna be happy and you know it,
And every little thing that you do
Will make you so happy and you know it,
Well, if you're happy and you know it,
And you're happy and know it,
And every little thing that you do,
Will make you so happy, and you know it,
Well, if you're happy and you're happy,
And you're happy and you're happy,
Well, you'll never be alone
And you'll never be alone
And you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
And you'll never be alone,
You'll never be alone"

If you dislike it, you will dislike the rest of the song:

"There is a lot in this world
That goes beyond our wildest dreams
There's a lot that we do to earn our pay
There's a lot in this world
That's better than you'll ever know
It's a lot of work that pays the bills
It's a lot of work that pays the bills
There's a lot in this world
That we never take for granted
There's a lot in this world
That

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: In my opinion, this is one of the worst vocals I've ever heard.  I'd rather listen to the song without vocals than listen to this.  I am pretty sure the vocals were recorded on a computer.  I've never seen such bad singing in a CD.  I would like to say that Robert Johnson, in his time, was a great singer.  I don't know.  I've never heard him sing like this.  He sings like he's about to burst into tears.  It's really sad.  He sounds like he's doing the "Wizard of Oz" song.  It's like a child singing with a sore throat.  Just awful.  I'd rather listen to Bob's songs without the vocals.  I am very disappointed.  The vocals do nothing for me.  If the vocals were not there I could not listen to the rest of the CD.  I don't understand how a singer can write good songs if he sings like this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I can't believe Robert Johnson didn't make more money by selling his soul to the devil (or to God, or to the devil's wife).  But if you want to know what this man was capable of singing, you have to listen to the entire song: "Good Morning Starshine."  You can't sing the next stanza without cracking up.  I did, and I'm not ashamed.  The guy was clearly mentally ill.  There are some good songs on this CD.  But the vocals on this CD are awful.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: This song is sung by someone who is very, very sick.  The song is about a man who is very sick.  He is not in great shape.  His wife begs him to go to the doctor.  He goes to the doctor and the doctor says he is sick with a blood disease.  This disease is called "The Blue Disease."  I know this disease very well.  This disease is very dangerous.  The man is very sick.  But the woman pleads with him to go to the doctor.  The man refuses to go to the doctor.  He says he cannot go to the doctor because he is afraid of the Blue Disease.  The man tells the woman to pray for him.  She does.  And she prays for hours and hours.  I know the woman is praying for him to get better.  It does not work.  The man dies.  The woman is heartbroken.  She cannot bring her man back to life.  I am not sure how this could be, but I do know that this woman can feel pain.  And she wants to bring her man back from the dead.  I'm sorry.

I'm not so sure about that. From what I've heard, it sounds like they took a lot of really good recordings. Their sound is a little on the jagged side, but that's really the only fault that I can find with them. Their lyrics are usually pretty good as well.

 

A:

I think you are right. It's a really good cd - but it's not as good as the cd they released a few years ago (which I haven't heard yet).

  They're not so much "jagged" as "shaky". In fact, they sound really nice. They're doing a great job, and the sound they're getting out of their sound system is wonderful. However, I'm not sure why they released a cd so short - unless they were afraid of disappointing people.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

My review: This is one of my favorite sets of all time. This is just in the same vein as the other two versions of this album. It's one of those sets that gives you all of the songs that you want in one album, but it's not as long as the other two albums. In the end, it's a good set. You'll notice that the first time I listened to it, it was a little slower than the other versions. The quality is the same. The vocals are the same. The arrangements are the same. The music is the same. I think you can tell the difference. There are a few changes, but not too major. I didn't like the one I bought (I think it was the one with the CD), and the one I used to listen to first was the one with the vinyl, and I didn't like that one either. This one I used to listen to first is the one I have now. It's nice. It makes me feel happy. It makes me feel good. The vocals are great, the arrangements are great, and it has a great sound. This is one of my favorite sets of all time. It is good.

Amazon review: This is a great collection of songs, but it feels a lot like a compilation. It's not a bad collection of songs, but I felt like I had to do a lot more searching for the songs I didn't know. It's good for people who like pop, but I think it's a little hard for people who like classical music and some of the more popular styles. This has a lot of hit songs that you know, but I didn't know the rest of the songs. I feel like this is a great collection to get a lot of songs that you know but not as many that you don't. I think all the songs fit together, but it really depends on what you like.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album a bunch of times. It's a great collection of songs. The only thing that I think is missing is the classic "Sha La La" by The Beach Boys. I know it's not on this album, but it would've been awesome to have it on there. Overall, a good collection of songs that you know, but maybe not as many that you don't.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite sets of all time. I think it's even better than the other two versions of this album. The first time I listened to this album, I didn't like it. It wasn't that it wasn't good, but the arrangement was really off. But after I listened to it a second time, I really loved it. The vocals are great, the arrangements are great, and it has great sound. This is one of my favorite sets of all time.

Amazon review: I bought this album a month ago. It's one of my favorite sets of all time. The vocals are great and the arrangements are great. The music is great and I can't believe I didn't know this before. I think it's a really good set of songs, but it has a lot of hit songs that you know but not as many that you don't. It's a great set of classic songs that you know but maybe not as many that you don't. It's a good collection of songs that you know but maybe not as many that you don't.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I have never bought an album from an independent label, but this one is good.  The only thing that would have made the album even better is if the songs were longer.  The songs are good though.  The band adds a lot of energy to the songs.

Amazon review: The band is not very good. They play songs from their live shows, but it doesn't sound like they are live.  The songs are good.  The only bad thing is the sax player. I've never heard him play before, so I have no idea what he's doing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is the 2nd time I've bought this type of album.  I purchased the first time in '99 - I must have missed a few days of ordering on line.  The only difference was that I had to order the CD from the internet and it was delivered to me in the mail.  I love the album.  Its the first time I've seen anything by this band, but I've listened to their music for a long time so I'm not complaining.  In my opinion, this is a great album.

Amazon review: You don't have to look too far to see why I love this band.  I've seen them live and I've listened to their recordings.  In my opinion, this is a great album.

I want to hear what this band is doing.

Amazon review: This CD does not deserve the "Gold Record" award.  This is an album by a great artist.  I think this CD is better than most of the CDs that I have listened to this year.  It's hard to choose favorites.  I'd have to say "I Need Your Lovin'" is probably my favorite.  Then "I Know," "I'm on Fire," "I Want It All," "I'm Satisfied," and "Ride" are just a few of the songs that I really like.  As I mentioned, I'm not really familiar with the lyrics of this CD.  But I know some of them are good and some of them are not.  I'm hoping that the lyrics on the CD are not to horrible.  It's hard to write about lyrics in a positive way.  There's no point when you're writing about lyrics.  It's kind of pointless.  I hope the lyrics on the CD are not too horrible.

Amazon review: This is a poor performance.  It sounds like a joke, but it's not.  The performance isn't what it needs to be.  It's not very good at all.  It has nothing to do with the song, it's just that the performance is so bad.

Amazon review: If I could only give two stars to an album, this one would be it!  I have to be honest, I only bought it because I love the band.  As a fan of the band, I wanted to see what they would do next!  I'm so glad I did.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this album one star because it's a really good album, but it's really not.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my mom because she loved 'Love Shack.'  I really don't know why she loves that song so much.  It's just not her type of music.  If she can't relate to it, then she doesn't have to buy the album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

My only complaint about this CD is that the CD does not have a booklet, which the majority of classical albums do.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was not thrilled with this CD.  The sound is not the best, the music is very quiet.  The only thing I like about this CD is that it has a nice booklet.  The music is not very good.  The only music I can stand is the Prelude in D, but it is not very good.  I am very disappointed with this CD.

Amazon review: I was very pleased with this CD.  It only took me one listen to appreciate the music.  It was the first classical CD I bought, and I have heard it four times.  I am a classical CD collector, and I have bought every classical album I could get my hands on.  I was thrilled with this CD.  As a jazz fan, I was disappointed that the music on this CD was not in the order that I would have liked.  It was the only classical album that I purchased this year, but I bought the next classical album in November.  I just finished the Christmas shopping, and I am now looking for a new classical CD.  I was hoping that the next classical album would have more information in the booklet, but that was not the case.  I am very pleased with the CD that I purchased.  I would recommend this to any classical music fan.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review:    You get the idea... the song "Serenity" by The Raspberries (now known as The Verve) is quite the anthem for the young of the world who are searching for their place in the world.  As a side note, it's amazing that this song is still being played.  I am glad that a band like The Verve can still have a song that is still popular, but what a sad world we live in.

Amazon review: This is an easy song to play, but very tough to sing.  It is a very positive song that is filled with energy.  I also enjoy the fact that these two singers do not "sing" the lyrics of the song.  I think it is a great song to play to your daughter, as they will be more inclined to sing it.  I also enjoy the fact that both the singers are young, so it is a great song to play to a young family.  The Verve is a great band for young singers.  I was surprised that this song was still being played in the 60's.  I remember the song coming on TV in the 70's.  This is a very simple song, but very hard to sing.  This is a great song to have with a group, but probably not the best song to have with a family.

I do not know what's going on but the first two tracks have no vocals at all. It would make sense that if it's an album with vocals, you'd get the track with vocals. It's like they decided to make the track without vocals on the album's first two tracks and then decided to get rid of them on all the rest.

This is not a good album. I bought it for the first two tracks and it was not the accapella. It's in the wrong order, and the vocals are not there, it's just silence. For the first two tracks they do not even have any vocals, in fact, the tracks are all just silence, with no vocals. I am very disappointed in this album.

This is not a good album. I bought the first three tracks and it was not the accapella. It was in the incorrect order. I found out that it wasn't the accapella after I got to the last track, so I went back to the beginning and listened to all the tracks. I listened to them all and decided that they weren't the accapella after all. I'm very disappointed. I gave this album to my boyfriend and he will not be buying it again.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
