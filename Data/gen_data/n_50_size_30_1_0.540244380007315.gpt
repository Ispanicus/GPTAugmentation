Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jewel for over 15 years. This CD is better than I expected. The CD had so much energy and there was nothing that I could not enjoy listening to. I just want to warn people who are not sure of the words to know that you will hear the words and the tune but I don't know if you will actually hear both. For over a year I have been hearing the words in my head. Now I know what they meant. I am very impressed with this CD and I wish Jewel all the best!

Amazon review: I can tell that a lot of people enjoy her music, but I never had the chance to see her live. But I just want to say that this music is so nice. Jewel is one of those people who can keep the energy up and the crowd going with her great songs. Even though she is not a very good singer, she knows how to do a great job at making people listen to her.

Amazon review: Jewel is a very good singer, but she does not sing in true style. There are many singers are much better than she is. She is not at all a soprano, and she is not a very good baritone either. She has a very good voice, but she doesn't sing in the way that you would expect from a singer who has been around for so long.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Jewel's music since she first came on the scene. I knew when I first heard her music back in the early 80's that it was going to be something special.

This is definitely a CD that goes out with a bang.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: So I downloaded the Tuxedo Junction for about 20 minutes or so and was disappointed by the fact that it didn't have any kick. I thought that was the whole point. I then read the reviews on the internet about it being an accapella and I was more disappointed that it was not an accapella. Now I am wondering if I should have downloaded it for the bass and kick I was looking for.  Not that I don't like it, just that I wasn't looking for it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I don't even know who is this singer that she is singing with.  I would rather listen to a woman for a change to get my mind off of things.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The best lyrics I have ever heard I'm not a fan of Lil Wayne but his song about the guy who is being held hostage by his mother.  The way that song is delivered was perfect.

Amazon review: I was a bit disappointed with Twiztid's debut album.  They were good but I was expecting more from the group.  They did not disappoint.

Well it doesn't even come close.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about the album and I am really disappointed.  I thought the album would be better than The Blueprint but not even close.  They are so much better than the Blueprint that I do not understand why the people at Twiztid decided to use the Blueprint in their album.  The words don't even come close to the album and I do not understand how Twiztid could listen to the Blueprint and make an album worse.  I just don't understand it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a shame that Twiztid used the Blueprint for this album instead of their own.  The Blueprint is one of the best albums out right now.  A lot of the songs on the album are very good and I highly recommend anyone to listen to the album.  The only songs that are bad are the ones that are very similar to the Blueprint.  I just don't understand.

I was really looking forward to hearing it.

Amazon review: This album is just so bad.  I was hoping that they would be able to do something more original but they just could not.

I just don't feel like hearing something that they tried to be something else.  I just don't get it.

He sings to both the heart and the soul.  I really enjoyed it.  The rest of the songs are pretty mediocre.  I don't understand why they put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007.  They were almost all the same.  They were all about how he was tired of being the bad boy, that he always wanted to be loved, I mean really love, but he could never get it.  How is that any different than AI??  He is just a boring boy trying to find love.  He doesn't have anything to offer anyone.  I know this guy is not bad, he's just a big kid, he doesn't know what he wants.  He could be good, but he will never be as good as Jewel.  I love Jewel, but she is just too good to be true.  Jewel is better than she has ever been.  She could sing in the high notes, she could sing off key, she could dance any old where, she could do any thing she wants, but she does not have the heart of a real musician. Jewel is just trying to be a singer.  She has talent, but she has not realized it.  You don't need to be a great singer to be a great singer.  You just need to be a good singer, but Jewel is just a bad singer.  She doesn't know how to be a singer.  She just says bad things about herself and her songs.  She is just a singer that was always singing in the shower until she was like 5 years old.  She can't sing a note, even to herself.  She can't sing off key.  She is always singing to the back of the room.  She doesn't sing to the heart.  She is not a good singer.  She is just singing to herself.  I hope she comes back and sings to the moon.

Amazon review: I had a friend who had a car that he wouldn't let the engine run (he didn't like the way it was running). He would put it in neutral but the engine would still crank. I took it to the mechanic, who told me that it was the car running itself (at random), and that there was no way to disable it. I have wondered if this song could be the solution for all our problems. I have no idea how this is supposed to help, but I have a feeling that it will (if the "random" is not just the engine itself, but rather the car itself).

Amazon review: I don't know how I can hate this song, because I love it. I would give it a 6. But I wouldn't call this song a masterpiece. It is a good song, but not great. I mean, I love the melody and the lyrics, but the musicality and the instrumentation are not really high. I don't think this is a great song by any means. It is not great, but it is decent. It is just good. It makes me think of my childhood, when I had the CD player in my room and I would listen to songs like this. It is nostalgic. It makes me think back to the days that were so much better than what they are now. I actually loved these days and I could not imagine this kind of music being on the radio now. I find it sad, because I do think it would be better, but I also feel like it would be too childish. It is a good song, but it is not really all that good. I don't know what to call it. I love the song and I think it is a good song, but I personally don't think it is great. I would say its average. It is an average song, but it is not bad. It is an average song, but, this is just a song I like. I don't know what it is, but I think it is a good song.

The lyrics are really good.  I like that the song is about the whole family.  Everyone is trying to get out and that's what this song is about.  The song is great.  It's a great song.

The Beatles' White Album (White Album)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

White Album is a 1976 studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released as the first in a series of three albums under the name of the White Album. It was the most successful album the group had released, peaking at number three on the US Billboard 200, number two on the UK Album Charts and number one on the Australian Album Charts. The album cover and title were designed by Brian Epstein. The cover was designed using a computer, and is one of the most famous album covers in rock music history. The album was recorded in four sessions during October and November 1974 and January 1975 at Abbey Road Studios, and was produced by the Beatles' producer George Martin. The album was released on 26 June 1976, and is the first in a series of three albums, which have been known as the White Album. The other two albums were released under the name of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

The songs on the White Album are all original songs, written and produced by their three band members, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I bought this cd at a record store in the late 90's.  I was a fan of the band.  Some of the songs were good but the cd is really mediocre.  I like some of the songs, at least some of the songs I heard but as a whole, it just isn't as good as I thought it would be.  I just hope others that have heard the cd and liked it find it.  I am in my early 20's and the music that i like has been pretty much lost.  I had to buy this cd just to see what i'd like about it.

Amazon review: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  It came with a CD with a song, "Let's Go" on it that was not on the CD, but it is on the VHS.  The CD is the same as the VHS, except for the cover.  The song is alright, but it is the cover that makes it unplayable for me.  I'm not sure if that song was on the cd or not, but I believe it was.  I'm just telling you guys that I have spent a good amount of time trying to play this and it just won't work.  I'm just going to give him the CD.  He is young and can figure it out himself.  I don't want him wasting his time with this.  I'm sure he'll figure it out.  I'm sure he will be fine with it.  It cost me about $15.  That is a lot of money for a CD.  I'm not sure what I was thinking, but it was a mistake to buy it.  I'll go out and buy a lot of music for him with the money I saved.  I'll buy him the CD and send him the VHS.  That way he can watch the music and not have to hear it over and over.  I am a man.  I can admit when I was wrong, I can admit when I was wrong, I can admit when I was  wrong.  I can admit when I was wrong.  I do love my son.  I love my son.  I love my son.  I love my Son.  I love my Son.  He is a man.  He is a man.  I'm not a man.  I'm a man.  I'm a man.  I'm a man,  I'm a man,  I'm a man.  I'm a man,  I'll be a man.  I'll be a man.  This is a man.  If you are a man,  I'm not.  If you are a man,  I'm not.  I'm a man,  I'm a man,   I'm a man.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review :  This is by far the best album I have ever heard.  My favorite artist is the one whose music I like the most.   I like the music that Twiztid makes, but to me it doesn't really deserve the attention it is getting.  To me, this album is better than anything they've ever recorded.  The only album I like in the past that has been better than this one is "Twiztid", which I have heard the same album several times.

Amazon review:  When I first heard this album, I was very excited about it.  It reminded me of the classic 80's rap that I loved.  It sounded like the music that I listened to when I was 15.  Now, after listening to this album for a few months, I feel like the music has been ruined.  The music is much worse than the music that I remember from my youth.  The music is so dull I can't really enjoy it.   I think that this album is one that I will never listen to again.  The worst song that I've heard is "Rapper Boy".  The worst song is "Rapper Boy".  The lyrics are very annoying and just really annoying.  I don't know why this album is on my top album's list.

Amazon review:  Twiztid is easily one of the most depressing albums I have ever heard.  The music is so boring that it makes listening to it a chore.  I don't know why this album is on the list that I have, but I certainly don't want to listen to it anymore.  I'm very sad that I have to listen to this album because it reminds me of the music that I listened to when I was 13 years old.  I've listened to this album for a long time and I just can't believe that it's still on the list.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I gave it a 4 because I had to get rid of it because of the crappy CD (I have been through several CD's and the last one was the worst) but, I was surprised by the music that they had.  The band is good and the music is good.  But, the CD is not worth buying.  It is not worth the money.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the group ever since I saw them at the  B.U. in '97.  They really are a great live group.  I was blown away by the music they put out.  I went to the show in Berkeley and caught all of the songs  that they played.  Everything on the album sounded great.  Not only was the music so good, but the musicianship was outstanding.  I'm not an expert with music but,  I'm not an idiot.  I don't know about all of the reviews saying that they are too old.  I agree that they are too old but, I can tell you from what I've heard thus far,  they are not too old.  These guys are still young and still have a lot to offer.  And,  they are young.  I know that they are young.  They are the first band to come out after I bought my first guitar and,  they are the first band to come out after I bought my first drum set and,  they are the first band to come out after I bought the first recording studio and,  they are the first band to come out after I bought any of the first electric guitars that I could afford.  They are the first band to come out after I bought my own recording studio.  All of these are things that they have not yet achieved.  I believe that they are great and they are up there with a lot of the great bands that come out today.  I've seen several bands come out around the same time as Revel but,  they are not as good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was surprised about the quality of the music and the band.  I've always liked the music but,  I thought they were a little too 'young' for my taste.  I'm not a fan of the blues either.  They are great, however, and  there's nothing wrong with them.  I was not disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I came into this album cold.  I had never heard of the band.  I heard the song 'I Will Survive' and instantly fell in love.  I was so happy when I found out that John had a daughter.  I couldn't get over that.  I'm a huge fan of the blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I didn't know what to expect from these guys.  I'm a huge fan of the blues.  I like the music of  many blues artists.  I thought that maybe the guys would just play some songs that I like just to see if they would like it.  To my surprise,  they did something  that I've never heard before.  They played me a song that many people think is too old for a blues band to play.  I was blown away.  I had never heard anything like it.  I loved the music.  I loved the band.  I loved the music and I loved the band.  I'm just a big fan.

I sent her the CD and she told me to get it for me.  I thought that this was going to be a big surprise but,  I was so surprised that I forgot about the mom.  I was blown away by this band.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!
