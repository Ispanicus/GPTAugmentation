Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: The music is pretty great, but there are some obvious flaws.  For one, the lyrics seem to be drawn from the same page of a magazine.  For another, the whole thing makes me feel like I'm in a bad, bad, bad, bad movie.  I wish there was more music so I could experience what the man was trying to say.  Just my 2 cents.  The album is definitely not for the faint of heart.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think that this is what the listener is experiencing as their listening experience.  I really like the "experimental" approach to music.  I also like the music overall.  However, the lyrics are very weak.  I don't care for the way the lyrics are written.  I prefer lyrics that are more direct.  I also don't know if I can stand to listen to the same song over and over again - it becomes monotonous.

Amazon review: Not bad, not great, but not bad at all.  I think that's why it was a big winner at the Grammys.  Not bad at all.  I also enjoy the album a lot.  There are some great songs, and some not so great.  Some are good, and some are bad.  I did like the album, but I think the album could have performed better.  Maybe the album could have been more polished.  But, I think the album as a whole is very solid.  I would not mind the album a bit more.  Good job, Mr. Ry.  I think you should have won a Grammy for this work.  That is awesome.  Good job!

The only problem that I have with this album is that the only song that I truly liked was the song "How Do I Know"  I have had it for over a week and I am still thinking about it.  I don't like any of the other songs.  There is a good flow overall.  I wish that there was more songs on the CD.  I don't know how many songs there are but there should be more songs.  I would like to buy more of your CDs.  I would like to share them with my friends.  Thanks again.

Amazon book review: Mr. Ry Cooder has written an excellent book about his experiences in the early days of rock and roll when people were still trying to figure out what they were doing.  So many people have written about Mr. Ry Cooder's early life and that's one of the reasons why he is revered today.  He was a man who was willing to take a risk and make a career for himself and I thank him for that.  Mr. Cooder is a very talented songwriter and I think that he has written this book to help people understand what he felt about his music.  I think that this is a very well written book.  I especially like the book that discusses his time playing with some

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review:  "The New Satchmo" is a collection of Satchmo hits from the late 50's thru the 70's.  He is the first person to use the term "Satchmo" and the "Satchmo" is credited as the first recording of this style.  He has a lot of success with his recordings and there are a lot of hits that he does not get credit for.  His recordings are from the late 50's thru the early 70's.  If you are buying this, I would consider getting "The New Satchmo" in a jewel case and get a copy of his solo album "New Satchmo".  "The New Satchmo" is not a bad album.  The vocals are good, and the instrumentals are also good.  The only bad part is that this is not a real collection of Satchmo hits.  Instead it is a compilation of songs that he got credit for.  He did have some good hits, but he usually gets credit for his own recordings.  A big plus is that he gets credit for the "Satchmo" style of music.  The only downside is that it only has 20 songs, but he does have a lot of other hits that are not in this collection.  Overall, I would not look highly upon "The New Satchmo".  There are some hits that are pretty good, but the average is not very good.  I would say that this would be a good collection for only people who are already fans of Satchmo.  It is a good collection for the older fans of Satchmo, but not many are going to want this one.  It is a pretty good compilation of hits, but the average is not very high.  I would say that this is a fair compilation of Satchmo.  It is not a great collection of hits, but it is a good collection of many hits.  For people who have Satchmo already, this is a good compilation of Satchmo hits.  If you have not seen Satchmo before, this is a good compilation.  If you like Satchmo already, this is a good collection of Satchmo hits.

Amazon review: This isn't a bad record, it's just not a great one.  If you want a Billy Joel album, get his latest release "Greatest Hits".  If you don't like Billy Joel, get this one instead.  He is not the best singer, but he is one of the best recording artists.  The lyrics are pretty good and the instrumentals are pretty good as well.  There is a lot of Billy Joel on this album, but not a lot that is amazing.  The only reason to buy this one is because it is the latest release in Billy Joel's discography.  I would say that this is a good record, but not a great one.  If you are going to buy this one, get his latest release.  If you are not going to buy him, get this one.  The only other reason to buy this one is if you are a fan of Billy Joel, and are going to go to a concert to see him, and you want a Billy Joel album.  The lyrics are pretty good, but the average is not very good.  The instrumentals are pretty good, but the lyrics are not that great.  The lyrics are pretty good, but the average is not that great.  The instrumentals are pretty good, but the average is not that great.  The vocals are pretty good, but the average is not that great.

The most impressive thing is that he does not get all the credit that he deserves.  He does get some credit for the "Satchmo" style of music but he does not get credit for the majority of his recordings.  There are other records that he does get credit for that

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazone review: I've been a fan of this band for a while now and I will always be loyal to them, because they're not only my favorite band in the world, but they're one of the only bands I listen to and enjoy.  This album is good, but I would have liked to have a bit more variety in the songs instead of just one big song.  One of the good things about this album is that they've incorporated the typical metalcore sound that they've been known for recently.  The music is very similar to a lot of other metalcore bands out there.  The drums are good, but a little too loud for my taste.  This is one of the few metalcore albums that I've bought in the past year, so I would suggest this album.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

I had never heard this song before until recently but it has a very familiar ring. I was listening to the radio and the song came on and I thought I could hear my Grandmother's voice singing it. I have known this song since I was a small child but never got around to learning the lyrics until this past week. I can not put my finger on why I was listening to this song but it reminded me of the music we listened to on the radio. We also got to watch the Flintstone television series. I had never seen the Flintstones before and they were so cute and funny. After I was able to say the words to the song I really started to feel like dancing around the house. This song is a great one to go to for dancing.

I like to listen to this song a lot when I am eating lunch, at work, or in the car

Amazon review: This album really has nothing to do with Christmas music.  In fact, the very fact that you call it Christmas music is the problem (if you even consider it Christmas music).  You're telling listeners when you say "Christmas" that the only songs you like are songs about singing and drinking and shopping and family.  Seriously, who was the person who wrote the original songs that became "Christmas songs"?  I find it hard to believe that anyone would write a song about the joys of the holidays and then call it Christmas music.  I am not making any judgments, but you might want to think about what your listeners might think if you were to release a song with lyrics like "Christmas is the time of year when you should be happy, and when you should remember who you are."  My guess is that many listeners would be laughing at you.  I'm not talking about the people who do love Christmas music but those who don't want to be reminded of their own misery.

Amazon review: This is a very enjoyable album, but the songs are all very similar and are quite formulaic.  The only exception is the title track, which is one of the most fun on the album.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album.  The songs are fun, and the lyrics are memorable.  I like the harmonies.  I like the beat.  I like the overall vibe.  I like that it's a little different from other Christmas albums -- that it's more upbeat.  I like that they included a few songs I haven't heard before.  But it's a little one-sided.  I didn't like the first single, "Fairytale of New York."  I didn't like the second, "It's Christmas Time."  And I didn't like the third, "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown."  Not because they're bad songs, but because they're not really all that different from the rest of the songs.  I don't know if this album will be well received by critics, but I do like it, so I'll give it a thumbs up.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard this album was good, but wasn't sure exactly what I was getting into.  The music is very nice, but the lyrics are a little cheesy.  The Christmas songs are the best on the album, but they don't really fit the rest of the material.  I really liked "It's Christmas Time."  I liked the second single, "Fairytale of New York."  I liked the third single, "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown."  But I'm not really sure what to make of this album.  I really like the Christmas songs, but I don't like the songs overall.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the music and the songs are all very different, but I don't like the album.  I don't like the concept of the album, but I do like the songs.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Christmas albums ever. The music is so good. But, the lyrics are so corny.  There is nothing but commercialism.  "It's Christmas Time" is a good song, but the lyrics are so corny.  And the last song is a great song, but the lyrics are so corny.  And the first song is a good song, but the lyrics are so corny.  But the others are good, but the lyrics are so corny.  The other songs are okay, but I wish they would write some lyrics that didn't sound like they're in a commercial or movie.  I love the songs, but the words are so corny.  The only song I like is "It's Christmas Time."  The lyrics are corny and the harmonies are corny.  But, "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" is a really good song.  "Fairytale of New York" is a really good song.  "Happy Christmas" is a really good song.  But the rest of the songs are corny.  The only song I really like is the last song, "It's Christmas Time."  The lyrics are corny and the music is corny.  But the harmonies are corny.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I'm a little confused with the CD. It isn't the complete song, but a little bit of the song. I don;t like this song.

I'm not sure if you understand the song, but it's the only song that's on the album that I like. But, I don't like the song. I'm not really sure why. I do like the other songs.

I'm a little confused with the CD, I think it's better than the original song, but I don't like the original song because it's a little bit of story, but it's just a little bit of story without a very good song.

I think it's better than the original song, because the original song is just a little bit of song with a very good song. I really like the original song, but I don't like the original song because it doesn't have a very good song.

Amazon review: Wonderful music, as always by Josh Groban.

Amazon review: IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm surprised the album's so good, given how bad it sound.  Just awful.  It's the first time I've heard a Josh Groban record and I had to stop listening after the first few tracks.  The lyrics are so bad that I almost didn't bother listening.  So bad, in fact, that I had to go back and listen to a few more tracks and all of them were the same.  I've heard better lyrics from other artists, so I'll give this album a pass.  It's not that bad.  The production is actually decent.  The music is good.  The vocals...  
I don't know, man.  I just wasn't a huge fan of the album.

Amazon review: "Don't Stop Me Now" by Josh Groban.  This is, I think, the worst Josh Groban album I've ever heard.  I think it may even be the worst Josh Groban album I've ever seen.  It's not bad, it's not great, it's not a good album.  It's just...  The worst Josh Groban album I've ever heard.  I didn't even know you could have such a horrible record.  I will not listen to "Don't Stop Me Now" again.  It's horrible.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Josh Groban - "Don't Stop Me Now".  I'm really disappointed.  The lyrics are awful.  The vocals are horrible.  The production is mediocre.  The music is good, but...  I'm REALLY disappointed.  I'm not really a Josh Groban fan.  I just think this album is awful.  This is not a great album.  It's a horrible album.  I really wish someone would just make a new album with a different artist.  This is not a good album.  It's not a bad album.  It's just...  I don't know.  I'm really disappointed.

Amazon review: Josh Grobans "Don't Stop Me Now" is one of my favorite Josh Groban albums.  He's got the voice and the songs are great.  When he sings the songs, it's amazing.  But Josh Groban has never been a great singer, and he's not going to be a great singer with this album.  I'm surprised the album sounds as good as it does because I'm sure Josh Groban would've made a lot of money if he sang a hit song like this.  I also really liked the songs "All of Me" and "You Raise Me Up".  Other than that though, it's just a terrible album.  I'm not sure why I bought it for the songs.  I'm not sure why I bought it.  I don't know why I bought it.  This album is just so awful.  I'm done with it.  It's horrible.  I have no idea why I bought it.  It's horrible.  The songs are terrible.  I don't know why I bought it.  It's horrible.  It's just...  I don't know.  It's horrible.  It's just...  The worst Josh Groban album I have ever heard.  It's just...  It's just...  I don't know.  It's just...  It's horrible.

Amazon reviewer: This is the worst album that I have ever heard.  It was not the best album that I have ever heard.  The vocals are horrible.  But that's not what I'm talking about.  It's not the worst album.  It's not one of the worst albums.  It's just...  It's just...  It's horrible.  It's just...  It's not the worst album that I have ever heard.
