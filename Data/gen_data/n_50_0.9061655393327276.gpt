Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

They also had a variety of interesting musical acts to choose from, and everyone was very appreciative of the performance.

Amazon review: This is a great song with a great message.  I love Robert Johnson.  I think that this song is a great worship song.  I also think that this song is a great worship song.  I think that most songs would do well as a worship song.  This is a great worship song.  I like how it is not a gospel song.

Amazon review: This song is from a Christian radio station here in the USA. I like the message of the song and the feel of the song.  The song is fun and positive.  This is the one song that I have been listening to all my life.  It is the one song that I listen to because I can sing the song and I am able to play the song as well.  I really like the song and I think that it is a good song to sing in worship.  It is a great worship song.

Amazon review:  I don't know if this is a good or bad album, that is for you to decide. It seems to me, that "If you're not with us, you're against us" is the message that is intended to be sent throughout the album. I am not sure that this was the best way of spreading this message, but I am sure the message was meant to be heard. If you are against something, you are against it. If you are for something, you are for it. There is an old saying, "If you're not with us, you're against us" which means that you are against something because you do not agree with the way that we are doing things. The problem then becomes the question of who is actually against the way that we are doing things, and how do we make sure that we are all in agreement with one another. I know that this is a question that is in some aspect of our control, but it is a difficult one to answer, because it is impossible to agree on everything. At the end of the day, what we do is what we do. The problem then becomes that if you do not agree with the way that we are doing things, then you are not with us anymore. I believe that this album was designed to show what it is that we do not agree on. This album has the same problem that the song "Barely There" had. It is a song that I believe the same thing as the song "Barely There". I do not think that it is a good thing that this song was made, but I am sure that it was made because that is the way that it was meant to be. I do not think that this song was made to be liked, but I am sure that it was made to be liked so that I knew that I did not agree with them. The same problem with "Barely There" was with "Barely There (Live at Madison Square Garden)". While I do not like this song, I am sure that it was made to be liked so that I knew I did not agree with them. I do not think that this song was made to be popular, but I am sure that it was made to be popular so that I knew that I did not agree with them. This is the same problem that "Barely There (Live at Madison Square Garden)" had. It is a song that I believe the same thing as the songs "We've Only Just Begun" and "Barely There (Live at Madison Square Garden)". I do not think that these songs were made to be liked, but I am sure that they were made to be liked so that I knew I did not agree with them, and so that I knew I did not agree with them. If you were going to talk to someone about this album and tell them that it was a good album that was not made to be liked, then you would be telling the truth. If you were going to talk to someone about this album and tell someone that it was a good album that was not made to be liked, and you were going to tell them that you did not agree with the way that they are doing things, then you would be telling the truth.

Amazon review:  I agree with the last few comments. It's funny that this album is one of the more "honest" albums I've ever heard.  It has a unique sound, which is why it's not "popular".  I'm not sure why the majority of the people I've heard rave about this album as if it's "the best album" ever made, but I'm glad that I can appreciate and enjoy it.  I do have to agree with the last comment that there is nothing wrong with this album, and I am glad that I can appreciate it.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think they are a nice band and I got into them before I heard them. They have a fresh sound. They have a good rhythm section and a lead  section. I think they have a good future.

Amazon review: I haven't been able to find much time on my hands so I decided to get this CD.  I like the songs and the  music.  I would like to see them play again.

I would like to see a little more  passion in their music.  I like their sound.  But I feel that they are a little too cheesy for me.  I think the musicianship is good.  But the sound is a little too cheesy for me.  There is not much substance in the music.  I will not buy this CD. I will not buy this CD. I will not buy this CD.  I will not buy this CD.

I understand that there are other CDs that are better but I don't understand why people would even listen to this CD.  I have seen the band in concert, and they have a lot of talent.  I really like them.  But they are not worth my time.  They don't have much substance to them.  I can't understand why anyone would buy this CD.  I have seen the band in concert and seen them live.  What more can I say?  They are really good.  They have a lot of talent.  They have good musicianship.  The sound is good.  But I have to say that I have never seen them play live.  They don't have any real substance to them.  I have seen them in concert.  There is nothing really to say about this CD.  If you like any other type of music, then you have a great album on your hands.  This CD is just a waste of time.  If you are looking for an interesting, good-playing, entertaining band, then this CD is for you.  I have never seen them in concert.  I have never seen them live.  But this CD is just a waste of time.  I would not buy this CD.  I would not buy this CD.  I would not buy the next CD.  I would not buy the next CD.  I would stop buying CDs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: The album itself is very good. The songs are well composed, and the singing is good.  The lyrics are not as good as, say, the music. A lot of the songs go in a circle with little variation.  It's also a little difficult to find people singing the songs in a way that makes sense.  Lyrics should be written for the person singing them, not for the song.  There are some exceptions, such as "Boomerang" and "My Generation," but it's still a little confusing.

Amazon review: I don't know what to think of this new LP.  This is my first time hearing it, so I have no idea if I've heard it before or not.  Maybe I'll get my hands on an old CD and listen to it to see if it sounds like it was made today.  But I don't think it's going to be my favorite song selection.  That being said, it has a lot of great songs that are hard to find on CD.  I like the variety of songs and some of the other songs that are on this CD are really good.  The lyrics are easy to read and the music is easy to listen to.  There is one song that I thought didn't fit in very well, but it's not bad.  The only problem I had with it is that I didn't understand the lyrics, but that may be because I don't understand some of the English vocabulary that is used.  The only real positive thing I can say about it is that it's interesting, but unfortunately I don't have my old CD for comparison.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to listen to it with my wife.  I didn't want to buy it because of the price.  But after listening to it, I'm very happy with my choice for CD #2.  The CD is a very easy listen.  It's a good mix of pop and rock.  The songs have great, catchy music.  I think I prefer this CD over the second CD, which is a little more of a mix of everything.  There are a couple of good songs that are on this CD, but overall, I don't enjoy it.  I would have liked to hear more of the ones that aren't as good.  I also didn't like that the CD is missing a lot of the songs that were on the first CD.

Amazon review: This is a really great CD, it's great to be able to listen to a collection of songs I've loved for so long.  I used to listen to this album for years.  Now I can listen to it for the first time.  The songs are a mix of pop, rock, country, folk and hip hop.  It's a very interesting collection of songs, and I love the variety of songs.  The lyrics are easy to listen to, and I think the album has a good concept.  It's a nice mix of music, and I like how the album feels.  The songs aren't always perfect, but I think it's a good start for a CD.  The CD comes in a hard case with a CD booklet and a poster.  This is a really great CD, and if you get it, you'll love it!

Amazon review: I bought this album because I love the musical.  I found the CD at a used record store, and it was great.  I purchased it knowing that it was a collection of songs I loved for so long.  I know the artist, and I have listened to his previous CDs.  I thought I would like this CD, but I am not sure I like it.  When I listen to it, I don't really like the songs that I already know.  The lyrics are not as good as his previous CDs, which is an insult.  The chorus is not as good as, say, his first CD, which is a real shame.  I don't understand the lyrics, and that is one of the things I can't stand.  I don't understand the vocabulary, and that is another thing I can't stand.  The vocals are not as good as his previous CDs, and to be honest, I can't see what the CD is about.  I like the CD, but I don't like it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
