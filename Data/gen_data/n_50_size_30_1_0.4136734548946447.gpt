Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this two weeks ago and I am still recovering from my disappointment.  The entire album is a mixture of the usual rock and roll and country and western.  It doesn't really sound like any other band's music.  I have heard them all and I don't like any of their music.

Amazon review:  I recently purchased this album and I am disappointed.  When I first listened to this CD I thought it was great.  I was really impressed with the music.  There is nothing wrong with the music.  The problem I have with this CD is the vocals.  I thought the vocals were decent.  However,  I have to say that the singers in this CD are nothing special and they don't hold their own when compared to the other singers I have heard on this album.  The harmonies are okay and the band sounds okay.  However, the vocals are average at best and fall short of what I would expect from a male band.  I listened to some other bands and I could tell this band was a woman.  I was disappointed as I had only heard good music from female groups.  As I was listening to this CD and thinking how good they would sound if they were a man I thought, "that's crazy, they can't sound that good.  They don't have the right stuff".  My opinion is that the vocals do not hold up to the rest of the music I had heard.  The album is a good album, the music is decent, but the vocals are not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have been a fan of this band since their first album.  The band has a great sound and they are very talented.  They have a great live show that has been a highlight of many nights of my life.  My favorite songs are "Just to See Her In The Light" and "Let It Go".  The vocals are very good on both songs.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this a few times, and I think it is a good record.  I am not sure why it is so popular.  It sounds good, but it isn't great.  I think the songs have a lot of potential, but they lack true emotion.  I also think the lyrics are fairly typical.  Although, they do have a good message, it is not very original.  The first four songs do not deserve to be on the album.  They lack the true emotion that I want from a song.  The last few songs I think are very good, and I love the guitar playing.  The sound is good on this record, but I think the lyrics are not very good.  I also think the vocals are good, but the lyrics are not very good.  The guitar playing is also good, but I don't think the lyrics are very good.  I am not sure what to make of this album.  I would give it a 3 out of 5.

I have to say this is the first cd I've purchased in over 10 years that I'm happy with. The cd itself is great, the cd was very well put together. I just wish that the artist had put out a cd without all the different artists that he has. This cd is a great cd and I will be listening to it over and over. I hope I get a good review. I would love to get some reviews in here. I'm not sure if there is anyone out there that can say this cd is the best cd available but this is my first cd that I'm happy with.

Amazon review: This song really makes me appreciate the great classical music of the 20th century.  I always knew there were great songs out there, but this is one of the best in a long time.  The lyrics are very descriptive.  It's not only good, but it's very interesting.  The musicianship is top notch in this recording.  It's the kind of song that you can easily get lost in, even though there is a lot of information to process.  I'm sure they will be back for more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I love this song.  Lately, I've been listening to the album "The Great American Songbook" by Leonard Bernstein.  It's a great album, and I was very interested in hearing this song.  It's a classic, and you'll enjoy it.

Amazon review:  I was disappointed by the reviews of this album.  I really thought that the songs I'd heard were really good, but not as great as the reviews here.  However, there are some excellent songs in this album: "Downtown", "A Nightingale Sang in the Vale of roses", "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Blue Soma", "One Armed Man Me Against Me".  I'm not a huge fan of the music of the 20th century, but these songs are very good. I can't say that they're "great" classical music, but they're definitely good.

Amazon review:  I'm no fan of classical.  I'm a fan of the Beatles, but I really don't like their stuff.  I've only heard this one song so far, and it's great.

I would definitely buy this CD if I was in the market for something in the classical genre.  I'm not in the market for classical music, but I'm sure I'll be buying this one.

Amazon review: I purchased the album because I love the song "Boom, Boom, Boom". It made me feel good when listening to it, and I've never been able to get enough of it. I bought it on a whim, because it was on sale and was just under a dollar in price. I think it's a great song, but all of the songs are extremely repetitive and have nothing to do with the theme of the album. The album is a bit too short for me to get the full message conveyed, but if I had to give it a rating, it would be like 1.5 stars.

I am not a fan of heavy metal or heavy rock but I have been listening to some great rock music for a while and I enjoy the album. I can say this I think it was a good buy.

I really like the other tracks, but I'm disappointed that there's not enough "Meghan Trainor" songs.  It's still really good. I don't want this CD to be a collection of songs I like.  I want to like a lot of songs and be able to enjoy the rest of the album.  I just feel like this album should have a lot more "Meghan Trainor" songs.  I don't know why they're not.  I really want to like it.  The only thing that concerns me is that this album has a lot of pop songs, but not a lot of songs that I could call "Meghan Trainor" songs.  I don't really want a bunch of songs where she sings about her love of "Poppin' Fresh Peaches" or "I'm So Lonesome I Can't Stop Cryin'.  I just want to hear her sing about her love of music and not about her love of "Poppin' Fresh Peaches" and "I'm So Lonesome I Can't Stop Cryin'.

Amazon review: I never had a problem with the music of this artist. I liked all of her songs. I listened to her when I was very young. I was very young back in the 90's so I was exposed to a lot of music that I really enjoyed. Meghan Trainor is a talented girl. I just have a problem with her music and the music industry.  I think she should just be happy with her music and be more open to other people's music. I think she should try to keep writing new songs and release them for the fans to enjoy. I think she should just release a few new songs each time a new album comes out. I think she would be happy with that. I think she should just be happy with her music and not try to push the boundaries of the music industry.  I believe if she just listened to other people's music, she wouldn't sound this way. I'm not saying she's the best artist in the world, but she's a talented artist.  I don't think she's trying to be the biggest artist or try to sell every song she writes.  I think she should just be happy with her music and try to stay true to herself and her fans.  I don't think she should try to push the boundaries of the music industry.  I think she should just be happy with her own music and not try to sell every song she writes.

Amazon review (2): After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet Radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD (1 review). The boys have beautiful voices and can not be doubted. What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD is the extreme repetitive sounding nature of the entire album. The arranger and choir leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The songs I love are the ones that are newer and have a more emotional sound, such as "A Million Miles", "So Much Love", "Falling" and "Let Me Love You". The production is very high pitched and I was hoping it would sound like a singer songwriter like Taylor Swift. The songs are so repetitive and I just can't get into them.

It's just so boring.
Sentiment: Negative
### (I really dislike this album, it's boring and repetitive. For example, I don't like the song "This Is Not the End" because it has the same melody throughout the song, it's just so repetitive. I also don't like "Why I'm Not The Only Guy" because it has the same melody across the entire song, and the rhythm is just so boring. Then you have "I Dreamed a Dream" and "The Last Song" because they have the same melody, they don't have any real meaning or rhythm. This album is not even a good example of Trainor's music because the songs are mostly repetitive and boring. I just don't like this album

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The whole experience from start to finish was so awful it was worse than the actual product.  The sound quality was terrible. The lyrics were written in a nonsensical language. The song was about a bunch of black men being brutalized by cops.  They were being pulled over in the dark. They were in the middle of Detroit. The cop was going to arrest and kill them.  I guess the first song was about the cop shooting them. There were no words. He was just beating them. I don't know what happened after that. I thought I was going to throw up. It was hard to hear the song. It was almost like there was a radio in the room.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves and appreciates music and the lyrics to the songs are actually good, but the songs themselves are not and they are not very well done.  The lyrics were written by Lin Manuel Miranda and sung by Alex Lacamore.  You cannot listen to this album on your own and when you do listen to it you have to listen through headphones because the music is so loud.  Lin Manuel Miranda's lyrics are very nice, but the songs are not very strong.  This album is for Lin Manuel Miranda fans only, and it should have been given a better treatment.  This album is a good compilation of hit songs from the musicals that Lin Manuel Miranda has been in, and it is also a good compilation of songs that you could not get on the original cd.  I would not recommend this cd to anyone who is not Lin Manuel Miranda fans.

I like the movie, but I am not a Lin Manuel Miranda fan.  I heard this album and I thought it was wonderful.  I am not sure why I like it so much.  I am sure it is not for all music lovers.  For me, it is very sad that a musical based on a movie is being done. I thought it was beautiful.  I thought it was the only way that Lin Manuel Miranda could be as good as he is, and I was right.  The songs are good, the lyrics are good, but they are just not as good as other songs in the musical.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very excited when I found out that Lin Manuel Miranda was writing the songs for this album. I had waited a long time for Lin Manuel Miranda to record new material, and I was very excited when I found out that he was recording a new album. I was not disappointed.  The recording of this album is absolutely wonderful.  Lin Manuel Miranda's voice sounds so different from his voice in the movie.  His lyrics are so different from the movie.  Alex Lacamore sings his lyrics just as he did in the movie.  The music is very different from the movie.  I wish I could spend more time here because the songs are just amazing and I think Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius and he is just as amazing as the movie. This album is going to be a hit for Lin Manuel Miranda and Alex Lacamore.  I am sure it will be on every record company in the world because Lin Manuel Miranda has a lot of power.  I am not a Lin Manuel Miranda fan, I am a music lover and I think this album is amazing.  I think it is going to be a hit for Lin Manuel Miranda and Alex Lacamory and I am going to be a big Lin Manuel Miranda fan.

Amazon review: I bought this compilation because I was so excited that Lin Manuel Miranda was writing some new songs and I was so excited that Lin Manuel Miranda was singing some new songs and I hoped that Lin Manuel Miranda is not going to make some of these songs the same as the songs in the movie.  I was so wrong.  The songs were totally different from the songs in the movie.  I thought it was so cool and I thought the songs were amazing.  I don't know why I am so excited about Lin Manuel Miranda singing some new songs, and I don't know why I am so disappointed in Lin Manuel Miranda singing some new songs, but I am.  I thought the songs were so cool, and I thought the songs were wonderful.  I thought they sounded different than the songs in the movie.  I thought they sounded like one of the songs in the movie sounded like.  I thought the songs were good and I thought the lyrics were good, but I just don't think Lin Manuel Miranda is any good as a writer or an artist and I am sorry that I am so disappointed.

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this CD because I wanted to hear the Lin Manuel Miranda songs that he did not do in the movie.  The songs are just not that good.  The songs are just not the kind of songs that you would listen to.  The songs are the kind of songs that you would listen to when you are a kid and you don't like the music at all.  The songs are the kind of songs you would listen to when you are a kid and you think your dad is the greatest musician in the world.  The songs are the kind of songs that you would listen to on the radio when you are a kid and you don't know anything about music.  The songs are

Amazon review: I really like the album. It is the first one I really like Eminem and I really like his voice. But for some reason, it is not my favorite Eminem album. I really like the first 3 songs on it and then it is really bad. Eminem is not that good at writing good songs. He still sings good songs like his songs to me but this album is just not good. What is the point of putting out an bad album. I like the songs that are on the album that are really good but this is just not that good.

Amazon review: When I first saw this album, I was pretty impressed, but it just didn't click with me. I just didn't get it. I think it is good, but I am not one of those people that really likes his albums. The one thing I can say, is that I love how he sings, and that he can still do his own thing with the instrumentals. So if you are looking for an album that just has a lot of good songs on it, and has the whole package of great songs, it will be a good one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I got this album for 99 cents from Amazon. I've listened to it a few times but I just don't like it. I have listened to it more than once.
